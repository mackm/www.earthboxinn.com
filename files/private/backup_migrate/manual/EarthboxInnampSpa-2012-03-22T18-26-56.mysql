There are over five galleries in this town, each showcasing different work.  For high quality, diverse shows stop in at the <a href="http://www.waterworksgallery.com/" target="_blank">Waterworks Gallery</a> that routinely displays sculpture, paintings and jewelry from top, Pacific Northwest artists.  </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  Further downtown is the <a href="http://www.arcticravengallery.com/" target="_blank">Artic Raven Gallery</a>, displaying artwork from Artic and Northwest Coast Native Americans.  The gallery’s collection of masks, wood carvings and prints represents local people including Coast Salish, Kwagullth, and Makah nations. <br />\r\n  San Juan’s own art museum, the San Juan Islands Museum of art (IMA),  is just up the road and makes it its mission to provide engaging shows of Northwest and Southwest Canadian artwork.

San Juan Island is the perfect place to indulge in the innovative ''land based'' whale watching. Increasingly popular, land-based whale watching is exactly what it sounds like, and can be just as rewarding as getting out on the water.  Lime Kiln State Park, aka Whale-Watch Park,  is the nation''s only park set aside for the pursuit,  indeed San Juan''s west side is spotted with special places  to pull over and watch the whales go by. Try stopping at the Westside Scenic Preserve, San Juan County Park or South Beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<p><h2>Large Boats</h2></p>\r\n\r\n<li><p><a href="http://www.sanjuansafaris.com/" target="_blank">San Juan Safaris</a></p>\r\noffers one of the best-organized and most professional trips in the San Juan Islands in their new, fast, 55-foot boat.

Drivers are accustomed to bicyclists and there are plenty of places on the island to pull over and enjoy the view.  Round trips tours on San Juan do involve some hills, but are still accomplished by many groups and families.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you choose to bring your own bike, Earthbox Motel and Spa will provide you with a bike rack to lock up.  <a href="http://www.islandbicycles.com/" target="_blank">Island Bicycles</a>, the local bike store, is barely two minutes from Earthbox and can help you out with any bike advice or route suggestions you might need.

Indulge in the freedom of water-side trails, watch for whales from one of many public coastal view points, or stop for lunch on a pebbled beach.</p>\r\n<h2>Coastal look-outs</h2></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Westside of San Juan Island is popular for newcomers and locals alike. It is on the Westside that you get the finest views of Vancouver Island, the Olympic Peninsula, and the Orca whales that feed in local waters.  Large tracts of preserved coastal land along Westside Road have great access for you to enjoy the view and walk the cliffs above the shoreline.  Ask the Earthbox Motel and Spa staff for exact directions, or take a scenic Westside drive and watch out for the look-out car parks.</p>\r\n<h2>Beaches</h2></p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Juan Island does beaches well.  Whether you want big and exposed or small and sheltered, there is something for everyone.  Got a kite? Why not head to South Beach. At two miles long, with a view of the Olympic Mountains, South Beach is a playground of sand, pebbles and drift wood.   Pack lunches can be eaten at the many picnic tables and there are plenty of easy hikes to be found at neighboring American Camp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further around the coast is the less visited but equally rewarding Fourth of July Beach. This stretch of sand is a little more off the beaten path and offers a great view of Mt. Baker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If small and sheltered is your style then Deadman''s Bay is a must-see. A gem of the coastline, the cove is dotted with Madrone trees, rock pools, and sheltered by the cliffs of the island''s Westside. With ample shady spots to spread out a blanket, it seems to be designed for those who want to relax and watch nature drift by.  Watch out for the Orca whales as they cruise the Haro Strait. Visit at low-tide and view tidepools full of small sea creatures on the rocks immediately west of Deadman''s Bay.</p>\r\n<h2>Trails</h2></p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is not only the island beaches that provide the opportunity to explore the coastline.  Lime Kiln State Park offers an array of leafy hikes that take you past rock formations, the historical coastal lime kilns, and the park''s lighthouse. Once there, you don''t need a vehicle to head south along the Westside. Leave your car at Lime Kiln Sate Park and pick up the easy trail that winds its way along the coast to Deadman''s Bay, a perfect place to rest and enjoy the view. Lime Kiln is also known as Whale-Watch Park. Find a picnic table, relax, and if you''re lucky and patient, you may even see Orcas and other whale species feeding in the surrounding waters. </p>','','full_html');

From leisurely coastline strolls to the slopes of Mount Young, there are trails to fit everyone and views at every turn. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The staff at Earthbox Inn & Spa is on hand with any directions or advice you might need to get you out and enjoying the best of San Juan Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, here are a few hiking highlights to get you started:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2>American Camp</h2></p>\r\n<p>From Earthbox Inn & Spa it is a scenic 15-minute drive to the South end of the island. There you will find the golden prairie land expanse of Historic American camp. This is a must-see site for hikers and history lovers alike. Enjoy easy but breathtaking coastline trails and a clear view across to the Olympic Peninsula. When you''ve had your fill of sea air, head back to the Visitor Center to take advantage of the National Parks'' display of historical objects. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2>South Beach</h2></p>\r\n<p>If beaches and picnic tables are on your wish list, look no farther than South Beach. Walk there from American Camp or drive south a further ten minutes to enjoy the largest beach expanse on San Juan Island. Take a kite, a beach ball, or just your camera and get ready to make some memories.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><h2>Mount Finlayson</h2></p>\r\n<p>Standing at 295 feet tall, Mount Finlayson is the perfect look out point for the island''s south end. Popular with both locals and visitors, the high ridgeline trail offers a spectacular view of San Juan Island''s coastline. With Vancouver Island on the horizon and the Olympic Mountains to the west, it is easy to feel like the world is at your feet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><h2>Mount Young</h2></p>\r\n<p>Once you have absorbed the open expanses of the San Juan Island''s south end, why not explore the evergreen and oak forests of the north. Mount Young is a perfect way to experience both the island''s nature and history.  On your way up to the sunny 650 foot high summit you will pass an 1860s British Marine Cemetery which dates back to the joint British and American military occupation. The last steep ascent is well worth the opportunity to sit on the rocks and drink in the spectacular view.</p>\r\n	\r\n\r\n<p><h2>Lime Kiln Sate Park</h2></p>\r\n<p>One of the most distinctive landmarks on the island is the lighthouse at Lilm Kiln State Park. A jewel on island''s famous Westside, this park offers winding forest trails and one of the best picnic spots on the island. Grab a table next to lighthouse and indulge in a bit of land-based whale watching. Yes, the Orca whales do come that close to the land.  Feeling energetic?  Hike north into the County''s Limekiln Preserve or south along the shore to Deadman''s bay.</p> ','','full_html');
INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','page','0','44','84','und','0','        \r\n<p>From your room in Earthbox Inn and Spa, you will have the town of Friday Harbor at your feet.  After you''ve sampled the delights of our historic port, however, the rest of the island beckons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring San Juan by car could not be easier, and there are a few sites we recommend as not to be missed.  Ask the Earthbox staff for seasonal ideas, maps, and directions.  From town we will likely direct you toward Roche Harbor Rd.  This scenic byway winds its way up the east side of the island on its way toward the Roche Harbor Resort. There are some real gems on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first things to slow down for is San Juan Island''s more unusual resident, Mona the camel. Yes that''s right, a camel in the Pacific Northwest. What is even better is that Mona lives opposite the famed <a href="http://www.sanjuanvineyards.com" target="_blank">San Juan Vineyards</a>. They have even named a vintage after her.  The vineyard offers tastings from 11 a.m to 5 p.m. every day, and the grounds are well worth exploring. Across the road, Mona is always open to having her picture taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of miles further up on your left you''ll see Lakedale Resort. You can get a day pass and go swimming in one of their lakes or rent a paddle boat.\r\nAs you continue up Roche Harbor Road and get closer to the resort, keep a look out on your left for the San Juan Islands Museum of Art''s <a href="http://www.sjima.org/sculpture.htm" target="_blank">Sculpture Park</a>.  Stroll through the 19 acres water-side park and view over 100 sculptures by noted Pacific Northwest artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roche Harbor itself is a historic resort with an old hotel, a spa, several shops, a fine dining restaurant and a café. You can easily spend a half hour enjoying the resort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, travel toward the west side of the island and take the opportunity to hike and enjoy the water at English Camp. If you would rather skip the hiking then head a little farther down the road <a href="http://www.krystalacres.com" target="_blank">Krystal Acres Alpaca Farm</a>. They have a viewing platform and a store with beautiful Alpaca products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the signs for the Westside (turn right on Mitchell Bay Rd.) you will pass scenic woods and pastures before pulling into the County Park. The next not-to-be missed sight  is Lime Kiln Park, with its lime kiln, lighthouse,  a driftwood beach and tide pools, the park is a pleasure to explore. It is also dedicated to land-based whale watching, so keep your eye on water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing along the west side of the island and you will find <a href="http://www.pelindabalavender.com" target="_blank">Pelindaba Lavender Farm</a>. When the lavender is in bloom you can smell it from a mile away. They have art in the fields and a store with all their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you head back to town, consider heading to the South end of the island via False Bay Road. Here you will find American Camp, consisting of acres of prairie grass, full of wild foxes and bald eagles. A bit beyond American Camp, at the South tip of the Island, is the Cattle Point lighthouse with amazing 180 degree water views.</p>\r\n','','filtered_html');

If they did we need to charge the CC#’s that the web agencies sent and refund the ones from the guests on file. The reservations in questions are 4033919 and 4033904. I added a “2″ to the end of their names so we don’t get any potential problems with the Innlink res’s coming in.\r\n\r\n    Please have housekeeping tidy 108.

So Laura wanted me to tell everyone that she took the mailbag today (Saturday) and will bring it back Monday. ;)\r\n    On the front desk is an array of spa treatments for guests to take to their room and check out (including a mud bath that sounds good right now)-there are some really cool items in this cute little bag, which, is for sale for only $25.00 plus tax.\r\n    tory Says:\r\n    February 8th, 2012 at 5:21 pm\r\n\r\n    coffee for birdrock is ordered and will come to earthbox on thurs. two 5lb bags:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 6th, 2012 at 10:44 am\r\n\r\n    EVERY PHONE CALL – OFFER MASSAGE\r\n    If it’s promoting our current special or just a regular reservation, always, always end each phone call with an offer to help book a massage treatment or an adventure.\r\n\r\n    ORCHID IN OFFICE\r\n    Don’t touch that baby. It’s way over watered. If you feel you are a plant whisperer, please take all the mossy stones out of the container, wash them, put back and DON’T over water plant.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN/REGINO\r\n    When closing the hotel for the night, please make sure the laundry room is locked.\r\n\r\n    POOL HUMIDIFIER\r\n    The breaker keeps flipping, which results in a foggy pool house. Dave will look at it today.\r\n\r\n    SPA MEETING\r\n    Don’t forget our spa orientation on Thursday at noon. if you can’t make it, please re-schedule with Rachael. her email is rachael@earthboxmotel.com.\r\n\r\n    Have a happy week everybody!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2012 at 11:30 am\r\n\r\n    FEBRUARY SPECIAL\r\n    Sprinter or Wring?\r\n\r\n    What do you call this lovely time in the Pacific Northwest when the first Spring flowers are coming, the sun is shining and love is in the air in February? Sprinter, Wring? Regardless, this is a great time to treat your Sweetie and yourself to a well-deserved getaway.\r\n\r\n    Sprinter: Book a Body or Face treatment (55 min or longer) at the Spa at Earthbox and get a Water Place for only $99 plus tax per night.\r\n\r\n    (2 night minimum, not valid with any other specials, room and spa treatment must be booked over the phone at the same time, subject to availability, offer ends 02/29/2012, room upgrades are available for an additional fee)\r\n\r\n    Wring: Relaxed enough; just need to get away? Let’s do it! Get a Water Place for just $129 plus tax per night when you stay 2 nights or more.\r\n\r\n    (2 night minimum, not valid with any other specials, use password WRING subject to availability, offer ends 02/29/2012, room upgrades are available for an additional fee)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2012 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    we are shooting to open on 3/1/12. Up until then all our treatments are available EXCEPT the nail care.\r\n\r\n    ALL spa clients are allowed to use the pool, sauna and hot tub for an hour before or after their treatment at no charge.\r\n\r\n    When booking any body treatment, please advise clients not to shave the day before.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 2nd, 2012 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please make sure to update the HK report in WRP once Rachel and Regino submit the hard copy in the afternoon. It totally throws them off the next morning if we don’t update.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Yes, it’s only February, but Clipper bookings have started. Please read up on last year’s procedures in the front desk manual and make, cancel, alter those bookings and confirm them on the Clipper extranet site. And don’t forget, when you see Clipper bookings in the box on the back desk, double check them and file away.\r\n\r\n    RECYCLING\r\n    Here is what I found out, RE recycling:\r\n    batteries – ACE hardware\r\n    light bulbs – OPALCO\r\n    bigger batteries – contact manufacturer and inquire about their recycling program.\r\n\r\n    So please make sure to never throw batteries or light bulbs in the trash. The squiggly light bulbs have mercury in them and our soil & water don’t need that. Put them aside for Seth to collect. The batteries just run down to Ace real quick. It’s not easy being green, but we do it anyways!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2012 at 5:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Khai\r\n    There are a couple of things that Cindy needs done on Wednesday(2/1). One the back desk there are a few envelopes.\r\n    1) NEEDS to be delivered early\r\n    2) Needs to be copied then the original laminated.\r\n    3) & 4) are for Rachael N.\r\n    Welp, that’s what she wanted me to pass on. Have a good day and I’ll check in with you before you close. :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2012 at 5:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys,\r\n\r\n    The new Spa menu is up on the Earthbox website. You may get people asking about nails because that is on there, too. Just kindly let people know that we won’t be doing nails until March.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 23rd, 2012 at 5:45 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY COMPUTER & VIDEO SCREEN\r\n    is all fixed. yeah!

It’s a Rock Island thing. Chris will try to fix it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    The wind is so strong that the covers don’t stay put (believe me I tried). left them off for now.\r\n\r\n    Can’t wait to see you all!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 3rd, 2012 at 5:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy New Year Everyone!\r\n\r\n    OUR NEW JANUARY SPECIAL IS UP:\r\n\r\n    $99 Post Holiday Recovery\r\n\r\n    After the holiday hustle and bustle are you looking to relax?

Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY\r\n    When making reservations for January, please let our guests know that we will be open from 9:00AM to 5:00PM every day. Make a note in their reservation, so we don’t call them again.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please don’t forget to check out guests in WRP around noon and, more importantly, update the HK report after housekeeping is done cleaning all the rooms. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2011 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    JOHN FROELICH\r\n    has 1/2 hour DT massage with Rach tomorrow at 1PM.

He is not a guest.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2011 at 9:45 am\r\n\r\n    ROBIN TURNER\r\n    A former guest is interested in buying a robe from us. I put a new one in my office with her name on it. It’s $60 plus tax. Thank you.\r\n    P.S. If you ever have an inquiry like that, ask Rachel if we have enough robes and then sell away:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 18th, 2011 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    When you redeem a gift certificate, please make sure that you change the reservation status from “gift cert only room still available” to “confirmed”. Otherwise the reservation is not on the books. Not such a big deal now (other than us looking not too bright), but in the summer this could be a disaster.\r\n\r\n    CANDLES\r\n    Will you please put a little water on the bottom of the candle holders after you clean them? It’s hard to clean them otherwise.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 8th, 2011 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK RESERVATION\r\n    Beware when making reservations over the phone to make the reservation for the right hotel. We had several guests who thought they booked for BR, but we put them at EB without them knowing. Not good, not good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2011 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK NEW SPECIAL NEW SPECIAL\r\n    Stay one night in December and save 20% by entering the password: dazzle20.

Not valid with any other special.\r\n\r\n    Remember: when a guest doesn’t know about the special by all means promote it, but choose the regular rate when making the booking and manually adjust the price.\r\n\r\n    Let’s get some folks staying with us. Happy room selling!\r\n\r\n    And: don’t forget to check the BR WRP for bookings while we are closed down there!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2011 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan made this cool set up for the wreath on the front door to be outside even when we are closed. so just re-hang it on the front door after we open and the closed sign gets put away.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2011 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    •Rachel has Mondays off, so no massages on Mondays for now.\r\n\r\n    •Rachel will need a 15 minutes turn around time between appointments, 30 minutes is better.\r\n\r\n    •All new clients must fill out a health form (on back desk). Even clients Rachel has seen before need to fill out a form, since this is a new business now.\r\n\r\n    •Rachel will take those forms from us when she picks up the client.\r\n\r\n    SPA SCHEDULE\r\n    The spa schedule (which appointment times are open)as of 12/1/11 is also in the folder with the health forms. When a guest calls, have a look, you may make appointment right there and then, call Rachel right away. She will do the same if she takes appointments.\r\n\r\n    Uiieeeh, great fun! We have a spa! Almost!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2011 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Laura wanted to pass along that she ordered a bunch of supplies and wants to make sure they are delivered to the front desk and are not sent back to housekeeping before she has the opportunity to check them out. Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all. Just letting you know that Heidi, the lady doing the Girl Scout meeting in the conference room, will be needing coffee, hot water, and ice set up on Tuesday. The meeting should start around 6pm. There are air pots and an ice bucket up there already from Monday night. If you have any questions you can call her. She has a room here. Rez #3750063. Although this is mostly a reminder for me since I’ll be the only one here at that time… :D\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 3:01 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON LIMIT 1 PER VISIT\r\n    Just a clarification because it came up today: “limit 1 per visit” means: no, a guest can not buy 2 groupons and make a 4 night stay out of it. 2 nights would be covered by a groupon, the next 2 nights would be at our regular or special rate if we have a special.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 1:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Beginning December 1st, all spa reservations are to be made directly through Rachel. She can be reached at 298.0556\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2011 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Dan Miller came in and asked to borrow a few of our airpots for the high school turkey feed. His tele is 378-2406 if they are not returned by Monday AM. He is aware that we need them for the conference room on Monday. And he has 3 of them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2011 at 11:17 am\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    Hookay! Now we are redeeming. The redemption code must be all upper case. Please put it in WRP like that so we can cut and paste it into the Groupon website. Also: Please make sure you write down the code correctly (which we haven’t yesterday). We can’t retrieve the code from anywhere, just from the guest. And: make sure to write down the groupon code as well.\r\n    Tory and Morgan stapled paper groupons to the guest’s invoice yesterday. Great idea. Let’s do that.\r\n\r\n    Then: even groupons which have been redeemed via I-phone app, still need to be redeemed in the groupon website with the dollar amount B4 taxes the guest spent here (i.e. groupon amount + candle + dog fee + extra person charge, etc.)\r\n\r\n    I know it all sounds complicated, but it isn’t. Just read you cheat sheet, pay attention and things will be fine.\r\n    Happy grouponing!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 19th, 2011 at 9:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all,\r\n\r\n    The monitor on the back desk computer was having issues today. It was only only activating every other line of pixels. Unplugging it from the power for a few seconds then plugging it back in fixed it. I went and got the spare monitor from BR just in case it does give up the ghost. The spare monitor may or may not be functional, we’re not sure. If need be I own an extra monitor we can borrow until a replacement comes. Just let me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2011 at 4:03 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    We have quite a few Groupon check-ins today. Make sure you get the redemption code and make sure you redeem those codes on the Groupon website when guests check in or latest when they check out.\r\n\r\n    Also: sold out of the weekend groupon deals. make sure you know what to say when people want to upgrade from a midweek to a weekend stay (read cheat sheet, Groupon counts as cash)\r\n    Happy Grouponing!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2011 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Have you guys seen the new WRP updates? There is a recent update which allows us to send an automatic email to guests after their stay. How great would it be to send a little thank you note and a link to tripadvisor?? :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 17th, 2011 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi hi hi,\r\n    Staci Baker will be coming in from time to time to get a pool key, her mother will be using the pool as per Cindy.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 16th, 2011 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    FYI, the WSF will be running an extra trip from Anacortes to Friday Harbor on Wednesday, November 23 at 1:30 p.m. in order to move traffic earlier and reduce backups – if needed.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 14th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    Oh yeah, baby! Please find the groupon cheat sheets on the back desk. Take time to really read it. Sit at a computer, pull up the groupon website. Make sure you understand it all and then, go get ‘em!!!!!\r\n    I’m at home tomorrow, please don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Please check the BR WRP during the days we are closed down there. Right now we are waiting to hear from a guest who wants a massage…..\r\n\r\n    CANDLES\r\n    Cindy is not having it (go Cindy!!!!!!). So until Cindy and the town guy talk we have candles. Maybe there will be a boxing match in the lobby?\r\n\r\n    Tere, Orosco and Karla said good bye today. I will miss them!:(\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for you hard work and for hanging in there!\r\n    Love, s\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 4:00 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n    They will send a photographer out in the next few days. Please go all out, show them to empty rooms to take pictures, be super nice, make sure the lobby and the property look tip top, you know…..\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 1:23 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    Diane Luderman called to inquire about the conference center on Saturday 11/12 for a memorial. I quoted her $50, so you know when she calls back.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    GROUPON INTRODUCTION\r\n    Starting next Tuesday, 11/15 we will have a coupon on Groupon for one week. During that week we anticipate huge phone traffic. We are adding a 10-7 shift.\r\n\r\n    It is absolutely pertinent that we all know exactly what the coupon is for and what not, how it is applied, etc. We can’t afford mistakes.\r\n\r\n    The boss ladies will have a conference call today where we learn all the details. We’ll keep you posted, this is just an introduction.\r\n\r\n    Folks will buy a 2 night stay in water or earth, good through 4/30/12, different price for weekdays and weekends (Thurs/Fri stays and Sat/Su stays are considered weekend stays) directly on the Groupon site. Then call us to make reservations.\r\n\r\n    There are ways to upgrade, use the weekday coupon on the weekend, use the coupon as cash value after the offer expires, all this and how we’ll put those reservations in WRP we’ll teach you later. just wanted to give you a heads up. Uuiiiihhhhh, wouldn’t that be something, to be slammed in November? Love it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2011 at 6:13 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Dave and Morgan got the hot tub to work, yeah! The power outage probably fried something and Dave by-passed it. He will call tech support tomorrow and see if he can get that fixed. Just know: we have a tiny pool party on Wednesday. If hot tub is under construction or is not working, call those folks right away. Better yet: schedule repairs for a different time.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2011 at 2:22 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Something happened to the hit tub during the power outage yesterday. It’s cold right now. Please apologize to guests and say we are working on it. Morgan says Dave needs to have a look. I have a call in to Dave. Will keep you posted.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    November 4th, 2011 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, we have a new flat rate postage log notebook so we can now send out items guests have left behind and keep a log of it (including a label to stick in the logbook).This is printed from the USPS.com website. Have a great weekend and remember to change your clocks back by an hour this Sat. nite/Sun. morning. ;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2011 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Innlink Res #F1S7XGREM was a no show at closing. Innlink placed them in a pet room but often this is a mistake. Therefore I left 2 sets of keys for Regino to give them. 325 if they brought a dog and 322 if not. I blocked out 322 just in case. So Khai, if they ended up taking 322 please unblock it and move their reservation. You will also need to take the pet fees off their res. Just unblock it otherwise if they stayed in 325. Thanks.\r\n    (ps don’t forget to check people out kthxbai)\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    October 23rd, 2011 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Per Raquel, I closed Rm 311 for several days due to clogs in sink and tub.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2011 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    Please check the schedule that is posted, there have been some changes to it.. Thank you everyone for your patience..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2011 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETING\r\n    Yeah! We will have an all front desk staff meeting on Monday 10/24 at noon at Earthbox. Please all come to discuss how this season went for us, what will happen next and how we can make things good. See you then!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2011 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Tory,\r\n\r\n    Hope the conference room thing goes smoothly for you (as much as possible anyway.) Just a few things for you to know.\r\n\r\n    309 has a bathtub draining problem. So much so that the tub is full of water and not going down. Seth came in to take a look but He could not fix it. He will need to rent a professional drain snake on Monday. I gave the folks in there keys to 303 so they can take showers in the morning. Please let housekeeping know that it will need a cleaning after the folks are done.\r\n\r\n    Thanks.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2011 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    just a reminder, we need to pay close attention to the innlink reservations that come in with the travel agent cc on file. They give pretty detailed instructions on what to do, but we are somehow still missing them and essentially double charging the guests. See reservations F1S7XAMR7 F1S7XAMRL.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2011 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n    I just want to say that I would really appreciate it if I could be given a heads-up to any birthday parties or large groups the pool house. :) Especially during the winter months. This time of year I base the chemical levels on how many guests we have. With an automatic feeder it’s really easy for the chemical levels to rise too high if no one is using the pool. Therefore, I plan for a certain amount of usage to balance the chemicals out. Too many people all of a sudden can make the levels drop such so that there isn’t enough chemicals to keep the water sanitized. Which, of course, can cause problems if someone has an “accident” in the pool or is sick. So for our guest’s sake and ours if the health department decides to show up. Please keep me informed of pool parties. Thank you!! :)\r\n\r\n    TL;DR – Tell Morgan if there are large groups/birthday parties coming to use the pool.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 7th, 2011 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    First off:\r\n    Kathy, there is a large group of people meeting in the conference room all day. We need to set up beverages for them. I have already set up as much as I can there are just a few things you are going to have to do in the morning. You need to make a carafe each of coffee and hot water. I set them behind the sink and labeled them. You will also need to go up to the conference room and fill each of the 8 pitchers on the tables with ice water. (the group person requested ice) Which means you will need to stop by the ice machine to fill up a couple baggies to take up with you first. Sorry. :( Steffi will be in the class so hopefully she will keep us notified if they are low on coffee/water. You may want to keep a second carafe full of each to replace it with when it is still morning. Good luck.\r\n\r\n    Secondly:\r\n    We are out of wine bottle openers again. Need to order more please.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2011 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Candles\r\n    What is happening to the candles that come without wicks in them? Are we throwing them away? Returning them for credit? If they are being tossed I would ask that you set them aside for me. I will make fire-starters so that when we light the fire place in the winter we can just use those to get it going. Let me know. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    I took the covers off the bikes because the wind was picking them up and making them fall off the bikes. The little drawcord string doesn’t get it tight enough to hold up against the wind. Any ideas about what to do with them? I was thinking a ratchet system like those used in lightweight cargo tie-downs for trucks. Think San Juan canvas could retrofit one into it?\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    REMINDER ABOUT SPECIAL PRICING\r\n\r\n    Pretty pretty please, pay attention to this. It is REALLY important.\r\n\r\n    ONLY use a special rate (i.e. Savor the San Juans) if someone specifically requests THAT rate (they say “savor”).\r\n\r\n    This doesn’t mean that you can’t give them a discounted price, but in that case, you need to select the STANDARD rate and then manually discount it.\r\n\r\n    When you don’t follow this procedure, it messes all of my marketing statistics up and that is a big problem!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2011 at 8:33 am\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Have call in to Printonyx to see when the map paper is ready. Please blog when they call back.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2011 at 11:03 am\r\n\r\n    Raquel asked me to order 1 dozen wine keys. Jared will deliver “very soon”. Thanks and enjoy the beautiful weather! It’s a nice day for a bike ride ;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 24th, 2011 at 9:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n\r\n    The spa called to tell us that starting on Monday the 26th, they will start going back to their winter schedule.\r\n    Monday through Thursday: open 12pm to 5:30pm\r\n    Friday though Sunday: open 9am to 5:30pm\r\n    tory Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2011 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    also the front desk, shelves, floors everything haas never ever looked so good and i had nothing to do with it…..go daytime people!!!! it’s soooo nice!\r\n    toe Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2011 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    building a & d’s water will be shut off from 11am to around 1pm. i made a note for the housekeepers to put in the rooms with stay overs and please let early arrivals know. the plumbers will be checkin with the front desk i’m sure before they do the shut down.\r\n    morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2011 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n    I hope the moving is going as smooth as possible for you Steffi. I really could have used your help tonight. Had a German guest with issues and the language barrier was making things a little difficult. Read notes on #F1S7MHM1Z for more info all.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2011 at 8:28 am\r\n\r\n    Here is our new October specials :)\r\n\r\n    $99 Savor the San Juans Special!\r\n\r\n    During all of October, enjoy the elements that make Earthbox Motel & Spa the most complete San Juan Island lodging experience at an unbelievable rate!

While they had it they were planning on replacing the brake pads so the van doesn’t squeal anymore. (yay!) However, they discovered that our wheel bearings were leaking so they are going to fix that then return the van to us early afternoon on Tuesday. (If everything goes well of course)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2011 at 2:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Map Paper ordered from Printoynx.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2011 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The new schedule is up and it’s all over the place for every single one of us, so please look closely, don’t assume things, go with the flow and have fun!\r\n\r\n    106\r\n    Had a leaky ceiling, probably from an overflowing bath tub upstairs. Seth is out sick and can’t deal with it. Our guest said it stopped as soon as the upstairs folks stopped taking showers, but if she is uncomfortable, let’s try to move her to a different room.\r\n\r\n    GOVERNMENT RATE\r\n    T’is the season for our lovely state worker guests to come up again. Starting in October we are able to match the government rate of $90 if the stay is for business and midweek. Just so you all know!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2011 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    - Check out my sweet new ride in the parking lot. 15 passenger rockin’ party bus. Classy. Seriously though, the hotel van is currently broken. It won’t stay running unless you keep your foot on the gas pedal. Finish Line Auto Repair will be by first thing on Monday to take a look. Until it is repaired we are renting the van from M&W. Please treat it with care, my name and credit card number are attached to its rental agreement. :D The lone key will be in cash drawer please make sure it is returned each time it is used. Thank you kindly.\r\n\r\n    - We are running low on map paper. Please call on Monday to order more.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2011 at 12:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Lovely Coworkers,\r\n    I thought I’d let everyone know that San Juan Outfitters is no longer transporting guests to whale watch or kayak. They will need to have their own vehicle or get a taxi. Also remember POWER OUTAGE is tomorrow night(from 11pm-6am). The Road Scholar group all have flashlights (18) that I gave to Emily today.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2011 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a few FYI’s\r\n\r\n    - The orange bike on my deck has a puncture in it’s front tire. It will not hold air. Please have Seth look at it or take it over to Island Bicycles for repair.\r\n\r\n    - The makeup bags in the back office need to go to Post San Juan. They need to be overnighted to the guest. Please make sure they make it up there before package pick-up happens.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2011 at 11:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n\r\n    This is a CODE: BRONZER ALERT! There are two make-up bags in the back office that need to be taken up to Post San Juan on Saturday. I don’t even know if they ship out on a weekend but it is VERY important that we try our best to get them out. The guest who left them doesn’t have any back-up cosmetics and therefore needs the bags ASAP. Guest is willing to pay for overnight delivery and all that goodness. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2011 at 7:51 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Opalco scheduled another of those planned power outages on Thursday, 9/15, from 11:00PM to 6:00AM. Please put up the sign I made (already in sign stand under FD computer). Morgan called all the guests. I informed all group leaders. Make sure we have plenty of flash lights and batteries. Good luck!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 8th, 2011 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?\r\n    We’ll talk to all of you individually, but I wanted to give you a heads up about our Winter scheduling plans:\r\n    EB will be open 9:00AM to 9:00PM starting in November & December. The hotel stays open in January (office hours (9:00AM to 5:00PM). Cindy and I will staff it in January.\r\n    BR will be open Fri & Sat November & December & some Holidays, closed in January.\r\n    This means all of you will go down to part time in November. Please let me know ASAP if you would rather not be on the schedule at all rather than being part time. Let me know your plans. Thank you so much for a terrific season. I love you all!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 7th, 2011 at 8:43 am\r\n\r\n    Let’s all take a minute and breathe and reflect on what an amazing job you’ve done. You ALL contributed to this being a wonderful summer. I know it wasn’t always easy, but you did it, you kept our guests happy and the property looking great. Fantastic work! Thank you so very much for everything you did and do. I love you all!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2011 at 10:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi lovelies\r\n    Happy official end-of-summer! It has been a wonderful one.\r\n\r\n    Now that Cafe Zia is closed for the slower months, the opening shift will need to uncover the beach cruisers in the morning.\r\n    I made a couple detailed alarms for tomorrow morning. Kathy, our guests would really appreciate it if you followed up with those as soon as you can tomorrow.\r\n    Everything was very pleasant tonight, so quiet it seems like winter!\r\n    xo\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2011 at 12:21 pm\r\n\r\n    AND THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CONCLUDES OUR SEASON!!!\r\n    Great job, everybody. You totally rocked this year. Thank you soooo much!\r\n\r\n    INNLINK\r\n    Now we will get innlink reservations again where the guest paid a travel agent directly and we charge the travel agent’s cc after the guest checks out.\r\n    Remember:\r\n    1) Check EVERY innlink reservation and see if the guest’s name is on the credit card or something completely different.\r\n    2) If guest’s name on cc: take 10%, charge guest upon check-in, the usual.\r\n    3) If name is completely different (like Orbitz for example), suppress pricing (that’s the most important thing!!!), write note in guest remarks like that:\r\n    Pricing suppressed, charge travel agent’s cc after guest checks out, put guest’s cc in remark section for incidentals.\r\n    4)Upon check in, put the guest cc in remark section, don’t erase travel agent’s cc. Double check pricing is suppressed.\r\n    5) Upon check out, charge travel agent’s cc.\r\n    Questions? Ask C, L or S.\r\n\r\n    Love you!!!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2011 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey boxers-\r\n\r\n    201 has two beach cruisers that they kept locked up from tonight so they could use em in the a.m.\r\n\r\n    The “sign guy” has come and fixed the sign right next to building E at the beginning of the driveway; there was an A missing.\r\n\r\n    That’s all! See you on Thursday :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2011 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL & REGINO\r\n    will be off tomorrow, Monday, 8/29. Orosco will be in charge!\r\n\r\n    FERRY SCHEDULES\r\n    We are out. Please go get some more.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Make them, please.\r\n\r\n    Last push, be kind, have fun and make our guest’s stay memorable (in a good way only, please!)\r\n\r\n    Thanks for all your hard work!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    TRIPSTER\r\n    Press the F3 and read up on our special starting Sept 5: 2 nights, 1 free whale watch tour. Make sure you make it very clear that this includes 1 whale watch tour for 1 person only. If there are 2 persons in the party the second person will have to pay for the whale watch tour. Also: not valid with any other special or discount! Just so you know!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2011 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    We have a number of people coming to the island today and tomorrow for the Concourse d’Elegance car show. One or two of these folks will be driving electric vehicles and may need to plug them in. We DO have a place for them to plug in, but we DO NOT have the cords to do so.\r\n\r\n    The outlet (a NEMA14-50 220 connector) is on the wall of the pump house (between the spa and the garbage dumpsters). Guests should park in the gravel right next to the bushes. You will have to crawl behind the bushes to find the outlet (it is at chest height) on the pumphouse wall.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2011 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK CANCELLATION\r\n    Guys, please remember that we CAN’T cancel INNLINK reservations. The guest needs to cancel directly with their travel agent. This is important because the travel agents will charge us commission if we don’t cancel with them. Thank you!\r\n    tory Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2011 at 11:03 pm\r\n\r\n    please order h2o in the am we ran out this evening. something is screwy with steffi’s computer. call chris t. night night\r\n    courtney Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2011 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay guys, are you ready for this? I sure wasn’t. So Stevie’s mom was using the pool tonight at around 730ish – no one else was in there, then this guy is trying to open up the door around 8ish I am assuming. So Stevie’s mom opens it and asks if he has his room key and he goes “no but my girlfriend reserved a room here and is coming” and then just walks right passed her to the exercise room. He uses that and the sauna (butt-naked in the sauna with a towel over). Stevie’s mom is asking him questions to get him out of there because it was obvious that he was not a guest, but he kept making up excuses. THEN! All of a sudden the police show up and arrest him on a court ordered warrant. I was with a guest the entire time so I did not catch this on the TV. At about 8:20ish, Stevie’s mom comes in to tell me the story and I am just in shock. So I called the sheriff’s department to confirm the story and it is all true unfortunately. However, I am not sure if it is just me, but I feel like the police should have come in and told me, or called later and say “HEY! We arrested a guy in your pool house by the way and he was not a guest there.” Sure would have been nice to be informed by the actual people who arrested him, but whatever. Anyways, that was my night. I am not sure if we do anything else about this, seems to be taken care of but I have to admit, I was a little shaken up when it was officially confirmed. I am sooo sorry I never caught this on the screen. I wish I would have :/.\r\n\r\n    Good night everyone.\r\n\r\n    Courtney\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2011 at 10:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew. Toasty.\r\n    Of course the first truly hot day of the summer is followed by the first night without a breeze. Lot’s of warm folks. Take a look at 3495232 in particular.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2011 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Batteries. We have them. woot woot!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2011 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    BATTERIES\r\n    First thing tomorrow, please get AAA and some AA batteries from Ace. Very important. Please blog that you did it!\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2011 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    CASK & SCHOONER\r\n    Guys, Cask & Schooner does not take reservations, first come first serve only.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers. We are all out. And if you take the last voucher, make some right away or let your coworkers know, please!\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy weekend! Give ‘em your very best!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2011 at 6:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone!\r\n    If you could please keep an eye out for two loose keys. On is black and says L2 on it and the other is a little silver one that says L3. They belong to the cafe locks. Thank you!!\r\n    Caitlin Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2011 at 10:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey,\r\n    We have a TON of ferry schedules because I called and had them mail us a bunch. Want me to swing some by??\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2011 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    Just a few things:\r\n    - I used our last pair of AAA batteries. We will need to order more or run to the hardware store to get some.\r\n    - Read notes in Res#: 3449869\r\n    - We are just about out of summer ferry schedules. Someone needs to run down to the terminal an snag some more. Or see if BR has some to “borrow.”\r\n    - I refilled the hot tub tonight or will be as soon as I get off. If we can, try to keep the patio doors and pool house windows closed on Wednesday. It’ll help keep the place warm and speed up the hut tub’s reheat time. Thanks!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    O.K. I officially declare BEST GUESTS EVER day here at Earthbox.\r\n\r\n    First that nice family from Maryland had breakfast here and I just love those girls.\r\n\r\n    Kathy, the folks from New Jersey wanted you to know that they saw whales on their kayak trip and they had a blast.\r\n\r\n    Then, and that was really the kicker: this lady from New York checked out with me. Totally straight face, very serious, she said:”When we checked in the only room left was a pet room and the guy checking us in said he can only sell us the room if we have a pet. So we went down to the port and picked up a stray cat. We are leaving now. What do you want us to do with the cat?” My jaw dropped, eyes widened… and then she started laughing and giggling and dancing around, “Got you, got you!”. I haven’t laughed that hard for a while.\r\n\r\n    Love it. Thank you guests. You rock!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2011 at 4:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Guys, we need to lock the bikes. During the day and at night. Especially this time of the year. We can get in real trouble if somebody just takes one and something happens. Very important! Also: bikes need to be back before it gets dark.\r\n    The night person needs to make sure that the bikes are locked and the bike hoodies are on, regardless of weather. Please do so.\r\n\r\n    EMAILS\r\n    Please make sure all emails are dealt with by the end of the night. After you deal with emails, please file them away.\r\n\r\n    I know, it’s so busy. This is it, the tail end of our season. You are doing great. I know it’s hard. Look at the daily check list before you leave, every day, and make sure you did everything. And remember: our guests visiting now have the same right to outstanding customer service than the guests we served in June. We love them! They make it so we can eat!\r\n    Together we can do this! And don’t forget to have fun!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2011 at 4:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay boys and girls, I know it’s summer and I know you’re going crazy, but I want to say THANK YOU! You guys are all really amazing!!! Keep up the great work and remember that even though it’s the end of a long season to us, each and every guest that walks in the door deserves our very best as if it was the first day of summer.\r\n\r\n    Now, given that summer is almost over, it means that we’re back at it with another special. This one should sound familiar, it’s another TRIPSTER special. If a guest calls and mentions TRIPSTER, or if this shows up in an online reservation, it should be the following:\r\n\r\n    If a guest books two nights on a Sunday through Thursday night stay from September 5-October 15, then they get ONE free whale watch trip.\r\n\r\n    If you are booking the special for them, make sure to use the password: TRIPSTER when you make the reservation. If the reservation was made online, make sure that it was made for at least TWO nights.\r\n\r\n    And!!! don’t forget to get all the details and book the Whale Watch trip with SJS and make the voucher, etc. Questions? Just ask me.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2011 at 1:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Just a reminder that futons do not fit in water places and its realllly tight to put one in an earth place. Thank you guys!\r\n    Courtney Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2011 at 5:18 pm\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to say hi. This is my first season here but I can tell, August is our busiest time of the year and I just want to thank everyone for doing a great job under pressure! Of course we can always give that extra umph! But I have enjoyed working with everyone and will miss everyone once summer is over. I can’t wait till next year when I am actually 18 and get to drive the VAN WOOHOO :) . Anyways, just wanted to say GOOD JOB! Keep smiling because you are all wonderful. And just breathe and try your best to stay pleasant while it is busy, it can get frustrating but it will be okay! Okay I am done writing my novel :) .\r\n\r\n    Courtney\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2011 at 4:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hiya guys!\r\n    Just wanted to let everyone know, if anyone who is with the American Lung Association books with us we are giving them 10% off. Cindy gave the ok (:\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2011 at 9:18 am\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE RIDES\r\n    Please don’t promise shuttle rides at 8:00AM. We are all by ourselves and can’t just lock up and leave, with the lobby full of folks and the phones ringing. Regino gets here 8:30 or 9:00. Between 8 and 9, just promise folks to call them a cab. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please double check the Clipper booking reports on the back desk. That baskets is full and now is the time when potential mistakes would really matter.\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make more spa vouchers. We’ll need them!\r\n\r\n    Happy August everybody!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2011 at 6:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Well the fire alarm went off today at Bird Rock because a 2 year old pulled it in the Speiden Room. I followed the directions on the panel and tried to call the number on the wall for “false alarms” but I got a machine that said they were closed for the weekends. So I waited for the call from the fire department like the note says but I got no call. Instead I got a call from Khaili at Earthbox asking why the alarm was going off. The firetruck showed up and the firemen came in and couldn’t put the pullswitch back in place because they didn’t have a key…..so I called around until I got to Seth and he said that it might be in the safe with ALL the other keys. So the firemen and I played scavenger hunt with the keys trying to figure out which one worked. All the while, guests were asking what was wrong and one particular guest was upset and complaining….\r\n    We found the key and I think that it needs to go next to the alarm panel or I wish someone had told me where the “special key” was. I couldn’t find a procedure for the fire alarm in the manual and I wish that had been more organized and less embarrassing. I’m glad the summer is almost over.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make sure to write the guest confirmation number on each spa voucher. Much easier to reconcile that way. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    106\r\n    Experienced a leaking ceiling. We moved the guest (thank you Morgan, for your impeccable moving folks around skills:) and blocked out room until Tuesday. Maintenance report made out.\r\n\r\n    It’s buuuuuusssssyyyyyyy! Thank you all for hanging in there and being fabulous!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 1:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, I spoke to Kevin over at San Juan Outfitters and they requested that we let guests know that for the Sunset Tour there is NO RETURN TRIP ON THE VAN. It is after-hours for them and there is no one left to drive the vans so they’ve been calling people taxis and paying for it. Thanks!\r\n    KT\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 11:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone-it’s Freaky Friday. When Clipper folks are checking in or calling, let’s make sure to get their phone numbers in the reservation. There have been lots of people not checking out on time, leaving belongings etc…..;) Have a great weekend!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2011 at 4:10 pm\r\n\r\n    This is just a test…\r\n    Are we working?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew…\r\n    - Victoria/San Juan Cruises group is in with only a few hiccups. Last minute switching due to ground floor requirements and all that. However there was one issue we all can learn from. If you move around any rooms attached to a group that is having a remote check-in. Make extra sure you update the rooming list and change any keys that have already been made. Had some guests walk in on people already in the room because the rooming list said they were in that room.\r\n    - 117 will be looking for a ride to the ferry at around 9am to catch the Sydney boat. Please try to accommodate them.\r\n    - A message has been left with Inter-Island Water to replace our water bottles. We are on our last one.\r\n    - We are getting low on AAA and AA batteries. Do we buy them in town or order bulk?\r\n    - There are a stack of keys by the mail-out box for BR. Door keys that went bad and have been reprogrammed.\r\n    - Our champagne is in at the Market Chef. A check needs to be made out and someone needs to go pick it up.\r\n    - We needed to use our emergency hold rooms for the night of the 6th. I managed to block out 314 but try to block out a different room type if one comes open and release 314 if you can.\r\n\r\n    Well, I will be hitting Ikea tomorrow morning. Give me a call if anyone wants anything. Remember, I do drive a Mini, so that EXPIDIT bookcase you’ve had your eye on probably will not fit in my trunk no matter how “flat-pak’d” it is. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2011 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    The pricing in the computer for when guest want to add a kayak or a whale watch trip, is priced for San Juan Island Outfitters and San Juan Safaris. Make sure that you use them for those specific reservations and again they are our 1st tear of booking company’s for those adventures..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2011 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    LEGGINGS AND CHARGER\r\n    Some time ago there was a bag in my office with some stuff a guest left with a note they would come back this summer to pick it up. They called today. Anybody knows what happened to the bag?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2011 at 11:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew, a ton of calls and people walking it right when I am closing.\r\n    -111 was a no show at closing. Called twice.\r\n    -Several people were wanting to leave bags bright and early before we opened. I told them that if, by chance the office is not open in time for them to leave their bags, they could set them with the coffee shop. (sorry Courtney) I left a bundle of luggage tags for C just in case.\r\n    -Best of luck in the morning I hope everything goes smoothly. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2011 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    LADIES & GENTLEMEN!\r\n    The Department of Energy is refilled! Help yourself and keep it coming!\r\n    Love ya!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2011 at 7:01 pm\r\n\r\n    PETS woof woof\r\n    I noticed that some of us are not having guests fill out pet registration forms when guests with pets check in. There are in the lower drawer of the back desk. Have guest fill out registration form. Give guest our pet policies and write pet name on it. And of course give pet a doggie bone.\r\n\r\n    CHECK EM IN\r\n    Please make sure to mark guests as “checked in” after you swipe their cards. Seems so obvious, but is easy to forget.\r\n\r\n    SWITCHING ROOMS\r\n    Uh, so many ways to mess up. So say a guest tags on another night and you go to “c” and do that and there is a room open and all seems good, please make sure that WRP didn’t assign them another room. Make sure they are in the same room they were in already. If that same room is not available, you may look on the availability page and see if you can move the guest, who is scheduled to check into that room after the guest in question. If you forget to do that then you end up with guests in rooms which are marked clean in WRP and oh boy, oh boy, we don’t want to go there…..\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2011 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT BOXES\r\n    I went through the list that we were given for the Potts/Rose Wedding gift boxes and it is not entirely accurate. The bride is aware of this and she asked that if they say they are with the wedding then give them a box. There are a couple reservations that needed more than one box, in which case it is written in their reservation notes. A couple of guests also checked in yesterday, we are working on getting their boxes too them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    DISCOUNTS\r\n    Please please please no discounts this time of the year (well, not on weekends anyway, you can give a leeetle bit off for a late night walk in). Charge for every futon, every crib, every dog and most importantly for every extra person ($10 for everybody over 12). This is it, guys, we just have those 2 months. Let’s rock it!\r\n\r\n    #3394176\r\n    Please everybody read notes on this reservation.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    I know we are busy, but please try to hack away at those alarms (hard to do at night, with everybody gone home), it’s getting to the point where it looks overwhelming. Thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. It shows!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 2:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    The Potts/ Rose wedding is this weekend with most check ins coming in tomorrow. We have gift boxes for each room (not each individual) in the luggage room. They asked to give them to the guests at check in. The list is on the back desk, I’ll write in the reservation notes tomorrow to remind us upon check in during my office hours.\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 11:19 am\r\n\r\n    EXCITING NEW THINGS:::\r\n    Roma Ogle is going to begin some Basic Boot Camp training classes in our conference room, If you are interested in starting the boot camp work out sessions, the following dates are mandatory to learn the beginning moves:\r\n\r\n    August 9, 2011 at 5:30pm and August 13, 2011 at 10:00am.. These classes will be held in the conference center at EB…\r\n    (I think you are only asked to attend one to get the information, but you can attend both, Roma will bring me a flyer and I will post here at EB)\r\n\r\n    Once these classes get up and going, we will have a sign up sheet for guest that want to drop in to the ongoing classes..\r\n\r\n    BIKE COVERS\r\n\r\n    Everyone working the closing shift has to make sure to cover the bikes with our new fancy and spendy bike covers.. I would like the bike covers put on at night RAIN OR SHINE…these nice covers will keep our cute little bikes from getting so rusty so quick.\r\n\r\n    Coffee shop openers may take the covers off in the morning, unless it is pouring down rain, then you may keep them on until the rain has subsided..Please store them in the bins that Seth has bought inside the pool fence..\r\n\r\n    Thanks ALL… I look forward to seeing you at Basic Training BOOT CAMP….:)\r\n\r\n    Thank you for doing this everyone.. :)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2011 at 12:44 pm\r\n\r\n    there is a bees nest by room #105, and the guests staying for six days in room number #340 said that the bathtub is draining really really slow. maintenance forms filled out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2011 at 11:00 pm\r\n\r\n    More news.\r\n\r\n    There is a young man from Turkey who really really really wants to go fishing. They are only here for one night so we have left messages with North Shore Charters to see if they can take them out on Tuesday. Please let them know if you hear anything. Res #3410009\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2011 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All!\r\n\r\n    The large wedding party called and cancelled/released several rooms held for them this Saturday the 23rd. So we now have some rooms open. I blocked out several for emergency hold because I just know, that we’ll get a wedding party member showing up expecting a room held for them that we don’t have. :\\ But otherwise, we now have some open rooms to sell. Woot!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2011 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    MY K-GIRLS:) KHAI AND KATIE\r\n    Can you please let me know when you will leave for the season? I vaguely know mid August, but when?\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Courtney Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2011 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone!\r\n\r\n    First time blogging – pretty cool :) . But anyways, I just wanted to let y’all know that this Saturday, July 16th, The Place has a classical guitarist playing that night. So we can let our guests know about that!\r\n\r\n    Have an AMAZZZZZZING day everyone! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2011 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    PATIO UMBRELLA LIGHTS\r\n    Will you please turn them on each night? It’ll look so inviting and cute.\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK OUTS AND EARLY ARRIVALS\r\n    T’is the season. Please spare Raquel’s sanity and o.k. the latest checkouts for 11:30 only. Also, on super busy days, please don’t call her and ask if a room is ready. If it’s not clean in the system, let our guests know we’ll get an update around 1:00PM and the rooms are guaranteed to be ready at 3:00PM. Offer to store their luggage, check out bikes, use the pool, whatever helps.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2011 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello my peeps. We need some moolah in the front desk drawer. Have a fantabulous day!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2011 at 11:15 am\r\n\r\n    Reminder……………\r\n\r\n    Kayaking Trips\r\n    Whale Watch Trips\r\n\r\n    All vendors for kayaking and whale watching have a cancellation policy, IF you make a reservation and cancel it after the cancellation time (PLEASE SEE SPECIFICS BELOW) WE WILL BE CHARGED……\r\n    So make sure your guests know what the policy is before booking a trip for them..\r\n    Cancellation Policy:\r\n    1-4 People 48 hrs\r\n    5-9 People 14 days\r\n    10 or more, please inquire\r\n    If you cancel within the above times and do not charge the guest accordingly you may be responsible for the fee we are charged.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for all your are doing this season, we do have an awesome crew and I thank you for all your are doing… :)\r\n    Please let me know if you have any questions..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2011 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    A couple things:\r\n\r\n    I ran across 2 different side by side deep tissue massages for that were only charged $170, and it should have been $190.00. Please make sure that when you book a massage you put in the right amount.\r\n    Also, when making a massage voucher, make sure that the guest reservation number in on the gift certificate.\r\n    Evening shift\r\n    Please make sure when it gets dusk out, you go out and turn on the umbrella lights in the pool patio and turn the heater on if a guest request it. You may shut the lights and the propane heaters off before you leave at night.. (don’t forget to shut the bottle of propane completely off)\r\n    There was a little boy that was hanging off the concrete stairs going up to the conference room, he was on the other side of the railing, a piece of the concrete broke and he let go and landed down below. He is okay, accident report has been written and pictures have been taken. I have a call into John Steven’s to have a quote for repair some of our cracked stairs, if he comes in and I am not here, call Seth..\r\n    Keep up all your wonderful work… Morgan I hope your vacation is going AWESOME…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2011 at 4:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Clock is not fixed. SJ Jeweler took it back and will let us know when it’s truly fixed. Probably on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2011 at 1:21 pm\r\n\r\n    $$$$$\r\n    Please count the till every night and drop money.\r\n\r\n    ZIA GIRLS\r\n    Please indicate on your drop if the money you have taken has been put into WRP or not.\r\n\r\n    FD CLOCK\r\n    Is fixed. Thanks SJ Jeweler.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 6:02 pm\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY 7/15\r\n    Guys, we have a huge group staying on Saturday, 7/16 only, so we have all these rooms for Friday 7/15, but when folks go online it tells them there is a 2 night minimum. Whenever someone calls for a Friday 7/15 reservation, please sell a room for one night to them.\r\n    Also: in general once the weekend is here and we still have rooms unsold, feel free to sell for only one night. Go to the availability calendar and see which room is only available for one night and sell, sell, sell!\r\n\r\n    INNLINK CANCELLATIONS\r\n    Just a reminder: if a guest calls to cancel an innlink reservation, please let them know that they have to call their travel agency directly. We can’t cancel innlink reservations (I mean we can, but then we still get charged by the travel agency and we don’t want that:)\r\n\r\n    Have a rocking weekend everybody!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 11:34 am\r\n\r\n    One more thing!\r\n    Lets make sure we all set the rooms as clean at three. If we don’t it makes the next days housekeeping report inaccurate. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    Guess what I located the bike helmet clips… They will be shipped out on Monday and should arrive next week some time.\r\n    I called the company directly.. :)\r\n    All the helmets that are on the floor next to the refrigerator are not in working order.. The ones that are should be hanging up..\r\n    :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 9:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Just a couple of little things\r\n\r\n    On busy weekends the latest check out we can offer is 11:30, otherwise housekeeping gets backed up. Housekeeping also requests that we do not call them to check to see if rooms are ready. They will update us when they are.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately we cannot keep doggies (or any other pet for that matter) in the lobby without the owner present. Apparently we had an escape artist of a dog in the lobby on the 4th.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, are we still thinking about doing a Cafe Zia meeting? I think we need to figure out a better way to keep track of how much we are making daily, etc.\r\n\r\n    Enjoy the sunshine everyone!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2011 at 6:01 pm\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    Came and went, we have all the keys we need now. Office and BR keys are here at EB. Come and pick them up from me if you need:)\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Very important guys: you need to attach Clipper reservations to the corporate account. If you don’t, the price shows up and all hell breaks lose. Please please do it!\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2011 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    Just a couple things:\r\n\r\n    - Please let housekeeping know that 338 will need to be cleaned. The guests in there moved to another room.\r\n\r\n    - Kyle the locksmith will be coming by either on Wednesday or Thursday to make some keys. We need probably at least 5-Lobby door keys, 5-sets of Bird Rock Masters/Kitchen door keys, and most importantly, 3-4 keys for the Orcas Room at BR. They are down to just one key. BR should have a master Orcas key if the one room key is checked out. Take a look around and see if we are missing keys for anything else. I know Khai needs a new front desk key and Katie’s BR master has never worked. In fact my BR master needs to be trimmed because it barely works in some doors down there. :)\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2011 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    307\r\n    Angela & Stevie: we managed to put a room on emergency hold for tonight: 307. Release after all your check-ins are here or around 7:00PM whatever occurs first.\r\n\r\n    # 2892449\r\n    This is the reservation folks made for 2012 for a sea place for July 22/23. I know that they meant to come this year because they are part of a wedding. We are sold out for that weekend. I managed to close out 309. Left msg with guest. When they call, please offer them the earth place. Ask Cindy, Morgan or I if you have trouble changing the reservation.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    EMPLOYEE FRIDGE\r\n    Is smelly and lot’s of stuff in there looks a tad abandoned. Let’s do the following from now on:\r\n    If you leave something in the fridge overnight, write your name on it. If it’s up for grabs, write: “eat me” on it.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS SOME MORE\r\n    So arrival date on each alarm AND if a guest selected “call me” in one of our add-on options, please call once, write note about call in remarks section, turn alarm off. Only if a guest booked an add-on (as in: something has been added to their invoice) will we call and leave the alarm on and call again and again until we reach the guest.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2011 at 10:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All!\r\n\r\n    Just want to remind everyone (including me) to be extra vigilant on Sunday. Due to fixing the mishaps that happened on Friday and Saturday, we do not have any Emergency Hold rooms to fall back on for Sunday. So avoid moving rooms around if at all possible and make sure you double check those keys so nobody gets lost in a shuffle. Let’s rock this thing!\r\n\r\n    PS. The nice lady in 336 will be by to get the motorized wheelchair in the morning. She needed someplace to charge it and it’s too heavy to drag up the steps to the room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2011 at 2:19 pm\r\n\r\n    WIRELESS\r\n    The wireless router serving Bld A, the Wind Place and maybe the Sea Places is down, phone line dead, Centurylink will be here on 7/5. Please let our guests know upon check in. Offer to hang out with us in the lobby or go to pool patio. Offer small discount if necessary.\r\n    Morgan, there is a super slim chance that Centurylink comes out today. If they do, Chris left his Road Scholar office key on my desk for you to give to them. make sure you get it back and give it back to Chris.\r\n\r\n    MISHAPS\r\n    First big weekend, some mishaps, let’s review:\r\n    Always repeat to a guest what room style you just reserved for them, be clear about bed configuration (say :”single King” rather than “Sky”).\r\n    When moving guests to a different room, double triple check that you saved those changes, look at it again, then make keys.\r\n    When making a reservation make sure you are in the correct YEAR, yup.\r\n    I know it’s busy and stressful right now, please pay attention. Review your bookings before you leave for the day (go to “recent bookings” in the “report” section”).\r\n\r\n    2012\r\n    And after above mishap I looked at 2012 booking and found 2 online reservations made for 2012. I’m 99% sure they meant to be here this year. left msg with guests. Try to accommodate them. As I said these were online reservations and not our mistake, but still, we should have caught this and didn’t. So look at the year when you get online reservations. Uiiieee!\r\n    Together we can do this!\r\n    Enjoy the sun!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2011 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please don’t forget to put arrival dates on every alarm.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Please make sure you double check to see if our guests requested a massage, whale watch tour or kayak trip when making an online reservation. We missed several recently.\r\n\r\n    CHECK UPCOMING RESERVATIONS\r\n    Which brings me to: whenever you have a second, please go through today’s check-ins and upcoming check-ns, just to make sure we didn’t miss anything (an add-n, a request for a specific room, an unanswered question, etc.)\r\n\r\n    THIS WEEKEND\r\n    Go ahead and sell single night stays for today and tomorrow. We still have a couple of rooms left and everything must go!\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    What did you find out about the bike helmet clasps? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    YOU ARE THE VERY BESTEST! OMG, we had such a big issue with a 3 night stay who needed an Earth Place, but were in a Sky and Morgan switched and finagled and moved and called other guests and he just did it, solved the issue. Thank you so much!\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th of July weekend, everybody! You rock!\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2011 at 10:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    The left front desk computer currently isn’t printing. Called Chris, waiting to hear back from him.\r\n    have a wonderful day!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2011 at 2:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Not only did we get new water dispensers (1) for the lobby and (1) for the conference room, but we also just got (2) new patio heaters.. they are so nice and toasty.. My thought is that they will stay unlit on the pool patio, if a guest requests for them to be turned on, please assist them, there are directions on the outside of the heater if you want to try it on your own, just remember, you have to turn the tank on in the bottom of the heater first.. If someone wants to move one over to the front of building E… NO PROBLEM.. Just make sure it is turned off and wheel it on over..\r\n    BUT……\r\n    The evening person MUST make sure that all heaters are turned off, and that the tank on the bottom is shut off. If a heater has been moved over to the front of building E, it must be moved over inside the pool patio..\r\n    Any questions?? I am happy to help.. Also, let our guest know they may use these, I am also going to have Dylan put some new umbrella lights up in the umbrella’s in the pool patio, my hope is that it will feel like a welcome place to come and hang out in the evenings.\r\n    Here comes the 4th… I am so excited.. Enjoy…\r\n    kathy Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone, We have a new water dispenser in the lobby. Cindy wanted us to all be aware that the instructions are in the lower part/inside of the tank and that the power must be off before changing bottle. Drink your water.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, just letting you know that we might be receiving a credit card authorization from a lady in Eastern Europe so that her son may use her card number to pay for a night or two. His name is Milosh(sp?). He will probably be checking in from time to time to see if we have received the fax. We can’t rent him a room without it. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2011 at 6:58 pm\r\n\r\n    SNEAK AWAY SPECIAL\r\n    So our sneak away special has a flaw. Duck Soup is not open on Mondays and Tuesdays (in June, will only be closed Mondays in July). I’m waiting to hear from Cindy and Laura on how to proceed. For now, I offered the reservations we have on the books already the COHO as an alternative (they are open, yeah!)\r\n\r\n    STATE PARK PASS\r\n    From now on when you park your car at a state park (lime kiln) you’ll need a pass, $10 per day, $30 per season. Passes are available at Ace and Kings. Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    FD PRINTER\r\n    We currently can’t print from the right (our right) FD computer. It asks for a password I don’t have. I left a message with Chris. Please call him again tomorrow if you haven’t heard from him.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2011 at 4:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys, we sent out a newsletter last week and I failed to blog about the special so here it is: If a guest calls and asks for the SNEAK AWAY SPECIAL, which includes a FREE $50 DINING CREDIT when they book a 2 night stay between now and June 30, 2011, just enter the promo/password: SNEAKAWAY and make a voucher for a $50 dining certificate to Duck Soup for them (and offer to make a reservation for dinner at the same time).\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2011 at 1:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, I apologize for bringing my friend’s dog to Birdrock the other day. That was highly irresponsible of me and I am offering to vacuum/sweep/mop the floors if that will make up for it. Sorry Regino for irritating your allergies. It will never EVER happen again.\r\n    ANGELA Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2011 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi–thank you so much for the reminder on the Clipper reservations! I personally have trouble remembering all that needs to happen with those. :-)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2011 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Please order 5# of coffee from San Juan Coffee Co tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    I double checked some Clipper reservations which had been checked twice already (?!) and found the following:\r\n    Several reservations weren’t linked to the clipper corporate account. That’s important, that’s what suppresses the pricing.\r\n    Several canceled reservations weren’t put back into inventory, as in a room wasn’t closed out again after a reservation was canceled. That’s also important. We got a Clipper in block reservation today, but we didn’t have any rooms. I figured it out, but please close out rooms in case of a cancellation.\r\n\r\n    MOVING GUESTS\r\n    When you move a guest to a different room and HK is gone (if they aren’t, please call them right away). Please close out the room to be cleaned the next day, but also: leave a huge note for Raquel on the back desk AND blog about it. We checked somebody into a dirty room last night, because it wasn’t communicated that that room is dirty.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. You rock!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2011 at 8:21 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    In case you weren’t aware… CAFE ZIA IS OPEN! Let the guests know we’re out here, Wednesday through Sunday 7:00am-11:00am. I like to tell the guest upon check in when we are showing them around the property map :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2011 at 12:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder about the whale watch delight special, we do not get commission for the one free trip that is included in the room rate. For example, if a guest books the whale watch delight special and wants a whale watch for two adults, we will only get %5 of the second persons whale watch trip. Make sense? :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2011 at 9:23 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK SOME MORE\r\n    Innlink reservations where we don’t charge the guest but rather a travel agent credit card upon check out, we need to suppress the pricing on those. Very important!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2011 at 1:26 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please put all purple bikes on one rack and all orange bikes on the other.\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    Is broken again. Cindy will call the repair people and keep us posted.\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    One of the guest washers is out of order. The quarter slot thingy is stuck. Seth will have a look.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER ABOVE BLOCK\r\n    Clipper reservations above block will get the same rate as Clipper reservations in block, but we reserve the right to not sell rooms above block on holiday weekends or if we are almost sold out.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for doing a great job. The season is here, uuuuiiiieeeeeehhhhhh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    CHOCOLATES\r\n    From now on we don’t order chocolates from San Juan Florist or Robin’s Nest anymore. We order them directly from SJ Coffee Co 1-800-624-4119. Ask for the romance package chocolate assortment. They may be able to deliver sometimes, but mostly we will have to pick them up. They made us a nice packages which looks good and consists of high quality chocolates.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 11:25 am\r\n\r\n    New Special is up:\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHER’S DELIGHT! Read all about it on the specials page, but here’s the scoop: Guests who call and say WHALE or book online using that code and stay with us for at least two nights in June arriving on Sunday through Thursday nights will get one free whale watching trip. That’s only one person per reservation. If you have any questions, ask me or Steffi.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 9:24 am\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Will open on June 15 and will be open daily through Labor Day from 6:30AM to 11:30AM.\r\n    Stevie, Khaili and Tory: there is a training with Cafe Del Arte scheduled for you guys on Monday, June 13. We don’t have a time yet. Laura or Cindy will let you know when that is. Please come!\r\n    We think what we’ll do this season is have the coffee shop person check out beach cruisers during their open hours. So we’ll need beach Cruiser release forms, paper clips and a couple of folders out there, and the bike lock and helmets. And you’ll need to let the guests know that they can pick up their credit cards at the front desk after the coffee shop closes.\r\n    Sound good? Make it so!!!!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Please email schedule requests to me or put them in my box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    INN LINK\r\n    Grrrrr. So: if we get an innlink reservation, please check the guest name against the name on the credit card. If it’s the same, take 10% deposit and confirm reservation. charge guest’s card upon check in, just as always.\r\n    If the guest’s credit card doesn’t match the name on the reservation, check on the innlink website (see Laura’s blog below)if it’s a travelocity booking. They have this deal where they charge the guest, then play with their money until the reservation is, then we charge their (travelocity’s) credit card when the guest checks out.\r\n    For those:\r\n    confirm reservation without taking any money, write superbig “TRAVELOCITY” in the remark section of WRP. Then, when the guest checks in, take the guest’s cc number and put it in the remark section as well (not in the credit card section). DON’T erase the travelocity cc on file.\r\n    Charge travelocity cc upon guest check out.\r\n    We just need to make extra sure to NOT charge the guest cc, because they have paid already and that just wouldn’t be good.\r\n    Questions? Ask one of your lovely boss ladies.\r\n\r\n    Have a great week everybody. Thank you for all your hard work.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2011 at 7:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that 301 is dirty for Saturday June 5th. The guests in it moved to a larger room.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2011 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hiya Everyone!\r\n    So we have a new computer system. We are now Mac people!! Chris is setting the computers up so that they turn on at 7:30am and off at 11:30pm all by themselves!! I also typed up a little cheat sheet on how to do some of the everyday stuff. Also feel free to ask me any questions about the new system.\r\n\r\n    :D\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 1st, 2011 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW WEBSITE\r\n\r\n    Check it out! Our new website is up! We’re still working on the photos, but the content is all there. We’ve worked really hard on it and it should be a good resource for our guests. I would really like for each of you to look it over thoroughly and let me know if yup have any corrections…or compliments ;-) .\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2011 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Raquel wanted me to let the front desk know if there ever comes a time when there are no pool towels in the pool house or the housekeeping laundry she has a stash in the orca room for backup.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2011 at 9:54 am\r\n\r\n    We are missing:\r\n    the hole puncher for gift certificates and the lighter for the candles. Anybody?\r\n\r\n    Crib got returned safely.\r\n\r\n    Ordered hot coco and 1/2 & 1/2 for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    Please bring the insane amount of left behind items to Post San Juan tomorrow. Please note the i-phone charger owner would like to have a quote first before we ship it. It may be cheaper to just get a new charger.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2011 at 12:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Another FYI:\r\n    I’ve rented a crib to a couple who are up visiting their parents who live on the island. They had extra family show up and they didn’t have enough baby-friendly sleeping areas to go around. I made a copy of his credit card and his drivers license. I put it under the cash organizer in the cash drawer. They will be returning it on Monday. Let me know if you have any questions. This is Morgan by the way. For some reason it won’t let me post a comment unless I say I’m Steffi. Weird.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2011 at 11:38 am\r\n\r\n    HI ALL!!\r\n\r\n    Just another friendly reminder that we need to make sure we are charging for extra persons in rooms, especially down at Bird Rock. Children are anyone under 4 at BR, under 13 at EB. And remember it’s $20 per night for extra people at BR and $10 at EB. Also please be aware of what rooms you can let folks pack extra people in. Water Places are for 2 adults and *maybe* in a pinch, a small child. We also don’t usually allow roll-aways or futons in those rooms either. They are just too small. This goes for the Cypress, Matia, Patos, Shaw, Skipjack, & Succia as well. So always keep in mind room occupancy limits when booking folks. Always try to get the number of people that will be in the room before you quote them prices. Thank You!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2011 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Ang,\r\n    we do put a little doggie blanket, food and water bowl, doggie towel and treat in the pet rooms before our pet guests check in. At least we planned to. Did a guest say something to the contrary?\r\n\r\n    Guys, I’m sick and will take tomorrow off. Thank you so much Tory and Myah for helping me out (0×0x0×0x0x). Please call me at home if you need help with anything.\r\n\r\n    What a great weekend, sunny, busy and we have such a great team. Yeah!!!!!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2011 at 8:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest Suggestion:\r\n\r\n    With our pet fee maybe we could provide doggie amenities such as dog bowls, bed, etc.\r\n\r\n    1-800 Number:\r\n\r\n    I’ve had several calls tonight on the 800 line and each call had long delay and garbled voice. When the guest calls back on the 360 line all is fine.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2011 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n    Just FYI that the lost and found forms and the commission sheets have been moved to the filing cabinet under the fax/printer/copier.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 9:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Angie, who does all the cooking for Road Scholar has asked that we not book Rm 307, unless it’s the only 1 left, between May 31-June 4. She has been getting in at 330am and trying to tip-toe around, but she still makes noise and doesn’t want to disturb anyone below. Thank you.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 12:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again!\r\n    I called Town Graphics and we should be getting our 2011 San Juan Island Maps in this weekend! I asked for multiple boxes!\r\n    (:\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 11:04 am\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone!\r\n    Okay so we had ANOTHER key card update! Your key cards that you have now may or may not work. Silly, I know… But if that is the case and your card does not work, please let Cindy know and she will make you a new one. Lets hope this is the last time!! Thanks for all of your cooperation guys!\r\n\r\n    Also, Guest who where checked in prior to the update may need to have a new key made. If that is the case just make a new key card and they should be good to go! (:\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2011 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPLASH UPDATE!\r\n\r\n    I just changed the spring splash special.\r\n\r\n    I’ve extended it through this weekend, it’s only valid on Earth Places and the rates are different. Check it out on our specials page: http://www.earthboxmotel.com/specials-packages/\r\n\r\n    INNLINK BOOKINGS:\r\n\r\n    I’ve now set it up so that you guys can take a look at the Innlink website and see the upcoming reservations. Sometimes you’ll be able to see which website it was originally booked through (i.e. Travelocity, Orbitz, etc.) so that you can get some idea how to process it. Steffi or I will show you how to go online to check these and will get you a cheat sheet so that you will know how to process them. Stay tuned…\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 4:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone!\r\n    We have NEW KEY CARDS!! If you have not gotten one yet they are in the cash drawer. (:\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    SELL THIS WEEKEND\r\n    Hi guys, we still have lots of availability for this weekend, so I took out the 2-night minimum for Saturday for our regularly priced rooms. Our discounted rates still will require a 2-night minimum. Sell. Sell. Sell.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 10:54 am\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    is working fine according to our fill in IT guy.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please don’t forget to put an arrival date in every alarm you create in WRP.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2011 at 9:26 am\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Wifi in Building A is not working. Please let our guests know. Offer to move them or to connect here in the lobby.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BOOZE\r\n    San Juan Island Distillery (Westcott Bay cider) is having their grand opening next weekend. Us hotel folks are invited next Friday from 3:00PM to 5:00PM out on Westcott Bay. Who wants to go?\r\n    We got some rack cards for them, distillery and cidery tours every Saturday 3:00PM to 5:00PM. This is a cool tourist attraction. Make sure to include it in your island tour spiel.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2011 at 2:56 pm\r\n\r\n    TOMORROW BIKE GROUP\r\n    The bike group which is staying here has their bikes stored in the maintenance shed. They can’t access that. They will go on a ride to Roche Harbor tomorrow, mid morning. Please have Regino open the maintenance shed for them when they would like to go.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please don’t forget to double check that the beach cruisers are locked up every night.\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Everybody needs new all access keys AGAIN. Don’t ask:) Just have Morgan, Cindy or I make you a new key the next time you work.\r\n\r\n    TORY & STEVIE 5/24 GROUP\r\n    On 5/24 Victoria San Juan Cruises will be staying with us. Seth will do luggage handling. For this one stay we will give them a ride into town that evening to take them to dinner (some of those guests are unable to walk, they used to go to Jimmy’s, the new Jimmy’s is not open for that date yet). So, Tory or Stevie you will need to take them downtown when they would like to go to dinner and pick them back up. We’ll need a copy of your driver’s license (please put in Cindy’s box) so we can put you on the van insurance. Please let us know before that date if you want a van lesson.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2011 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS SPECIALS SPECIALS\r\n    I made a specials cheat sheet with all our ongoing specials on it. A longer version can be found in the front desk manual. A quick reference sheet can be found on each of our computers.\r\n    Rock on!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2011 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST PHONES\r\n    Remember the memo you all initialed on 4/15. We really meant it. Please let Cindy or I know if below is not clear to you:\r\n    Remember when guests called to say their message light is blinking and there was nothing we could do about it? It’s fixed, yeah!\r\n    What we need to do is check guests in and out in the phone system every day. This might seem tedious at first, but it will be easier in the long run.\r\n    Every morning print out your check-outs for the day and around 11 go to the back desk phone (not the phone console, the actual phone), hit the “check in/out” button and follow the instructions.\r\n    After every ferry rush check our guests in in the phone system by using the same button and following the instruction, then file the invoices away (put in white box in bathroom), so we only have in our drawer the invoices of recent guests which need to be checked into the phone system. The reason being, we can’t clear message, messages clear automatically when we check in another guest.\r\n    I know this must sound overwhelming. It’s really no big deal. Have us show you. Please ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER PART VCXXXXXXCVCXIIIII\r\n    Showtime: first Clipper guest will arrive on May 21. We started today to print out upcoming Clipper reservations from the Clipper website:\r\n    AM shift:\r\n    1) Go to the Clipper website and sign in\r\n    2) go to “view bookings”\r\n    3) click on “arrival date”, select today through seven days from today, print\r\n    4) note which reservations have been cancelled, which are active\r\n    5) Look up all reservations on WRP, make sure everything is correct, the active ones are active, the cancelled ones are cancelled. Make changes as necessary.\r\n    6) Look up “unit closeouts” in WRP, release all rooms for that week which haven’t been released yet.\r\n    7) Date and initial, put in back desk basket to be double checked.\r\n    PM shift:\r\n    Take report from back desk, repeat steps 5-7, date, initial and file in Clipper file (under printer in my office).\r\n    Any questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    CLOSED SIGN\r\n    Please put the closed sign for the lobby door UNDER the chair as opposed to behind it. It scratches up the wall behind the chair.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you. Have a great week everybody. Call me if you need me:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2011 at 11:09 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Angela for handling the power outage notifications so well:)\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR EARLY ARRIVAL/STAYOVER\r\n    It’s not necessary to have our road scholar guests who are staying longer to check in with us twice. Just make their key for the entire stay.\r\n\r\n    INNLINK\r\n    When you process in innlink reservation, please make sure to go into the edit screen after charging the guest’s card, and change the guest status to “confirmed”, select “innlink” as the source code and select their credit card type (if you don’t it will say invalid credit card, which isn’t true). Please don’t forget to take this step or WRP won’t assign a room to the reservation.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2011 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY 5/26 PLANNED POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Opalco is having a planned power outage on Thursday 5/26 from 11:45PM to 4:00AM. Kathy or Angela, will you please call the guests staying with us that night, explain the situation and offer to move their reservation if this is unacceptable to them? It’s island wide.\r\n    If you make a reservation for anybody staying that night, please mention the power outage. Nobody should have any issue with that if they know up front and why.\r\n    On that day, we’ll need to get flashlights for our guests upon check in. Maybe we should make a sign for the front desk as well.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 5:17 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL USAGE\r\n    Hello all! This is just a reminder that the spa has a deal set up with us that their guests can pay $5 to use our pool before/after their treatment. The pool use can only be done on the day of their treatment and you need to call the spa to confirm that they do actually have a treatment to let them in. Just ring it up as a point of sale purchase. Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We will not sell rooms to the Victoria Clipper above block (that’s when they call us as opposed to emailing us)during July 2, 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n    DUCK SOUP\r\n    Is now also on our voucher program, so for Romance package dining vouchers we can offer COHO, The Place and Duck Soup Inn.\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    We will not provide room service anymore. All references to it have been taken from the website. I took most references out of the guest directories (which we will re-do very soon). For now if somebody inquires about it, please say we are phasing that out, but please accommodate the guest and do room service until we will have the new guest directories.\r\n\r\n    GUEST INJURY\r\n    If a guest gets injured on our property or on our bikes we NEED to have an incident report filled out by the guest.\r\n    Always be passionate, never admit to any fault on our part (as in:”Yeah, those stairs, we all trip over them all the time”), offer to call a doctor.\r\n    The incident reports are in the upper file cabinet under the printer in my office.\r\n    And: never give out drugs. We are legally not allowed to dispense any drugs, not even Tylenol or Aspirin.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    The moped is back… This is for advertising for Susie’s Moped’s SO, if someone comes in side to inquire about it, sell them a voucher for Susie’s..\r\n    ALSO this moped will need to be moved into the pool gate EVERY night and moved outside the gate EVERY morning..\r\n    Thanks..\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2011 at 12:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n    We have a gust who has lost their wallet. If you happen to find it he is conf. # 3124780 and to just call the number on file. Thank you so much!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    BECAUSE I’M TRYING TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY…\r\n\r\n    I have uploaded two more specials. But these each require a password for the guest to access (and remember if you are given the password, you can just enter it into the booking form and you should just see that price).\r\n\r\n    HARBORS: This entitles people who are members of the Harbors Travel Club to get 10% off, regular rate only, subject to availability, i.e. not on holidays, not combinable with other discounts or specials. They must show their Harbors Travel Club card on check in to get this rate.\r\n\r\n    TRIPSTER: An all new kind of special. For guests booking a minimum of two nights, they will get a free (to them) $50 dining credit. They must STAY between now and June 30th and AT LEAST 2 nights. IMPORTANT! Remember to make a dining voucher for them of $50 to Duck Soup restaurant. File this the same way you would any other gift certificate or voucher.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2011 at 9:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPLASH – New and Improved…\r\n\r\n    Read the new special details on our Specials page. Make note, it is similar to the previous special EXCEPT, it is only good on Sundays through Thursdays. Questions? Don’t be shy about asking.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2011 at 4:14 pm\r\n\r\n    A few things :)\r\n    Porsche Club will be returning the August, please take a moment to look at their group info. Take a look at the billing information and the 2 day min..\r\n    Victoria Clipper\r\n    You may notice that their rates are a few cents off on their email confirmations, don’t worry about what that says, what I have in our WRP system is the correct rate.\r\n    New Time Clock\r\n    Yahhoo , we have received new time clocks.. I am excited, you probable won’t notice the difference except for BR will actually have a clock you can use, but when I get it all up and running, please take note that you will all have new swiper cards, you don’t actually swipe these, you wave them in front of the clock.. I will be putting up instructions on how you clock in at the different hotels and departments so watch for the notice..\r\n    Thanks everyone for coming to the party.. It was fun and the food of course was awesome..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2011 at 2:31 pm\r\n\r\n    MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\r\n    Please don’t take any more Saturday night only reservation for memorial day weekend. We instituted a 2 night minimum stay. Can’t do it on WRP today though, because WRP is down. Grrrrrr.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2011 at 7:20 pm\r\n\r\n    TWO NIGHT MINIMUM STAY\r\n    Just a reminder: in July and August we require a two night minimum stay on the weekends. On the day of, if you have a walk-in you may sell a room for just one night.\r\n\r\n    HAGGLING\r\n    You are not only allowed, but also encouraged to cut deals with people in order to get them to stay here, especially midweek or when we aren’t sold out, BUT be very careful how you present the price. ALWAYS start with our rack rate, then if you get resistance offer a 10% discount for example, BUT make sure you say something along the line of:” We don’t officially have a military discount, but if you make the reservation with me right now, I’ll give you a 10 % discount.” Then if the guest needs to discuss it with their travel partner and says he will call us back, please tell him your name, how long you will be there and when you will be back and that they should call YOU back. This way we can avoid scenes like: “That will be $227 per night.” “Well, the other girl told me it was $149.”\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. Have a great week!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2011 at 4:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Mother’s Day Frolic:\r\n    This is what the spa is calling their mother’s day special. What it is is $5 off any treatment any mom gets over the Mother’s Day weekend :) Please tell the guests!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2011 at 9:30 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all..\r\n    I know we all like to come into our shift with things in order, so from today on, please do the following and before you leave your shift: lobby vacuumed, counters dusted off, candles in order on counters, (if they are empty, please put a new candle in, I LOVE it when I come in and see that the person on the shift before has all new candles in the extra candle holders in the back ready to go) garbage taken out, (don’t forget about the recycle), pillows in order on the couches and chairs, coffee service stocked, flowers dealt with (dropped leaves on the counter, pick them up, new water needed in the vase, change it out, dead flowers, out they go) The lobby is your responsibility, housekeeping is not in here on a consistent schedule..\r\n    One more thing, please have the candles lite at all times, if the smelly candle bothers you, you don’t have to light that one.\r\n    Thanks everyone.. I appreciate all you do and all the little details that I ask you to do that you do..\r\n    :)\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2011 at 8:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n    I had a lady come in today who stayed with us and thinks she may have left a grey scarf. I didn’t see one but took her info and said I would ask about it. So if anyone has seen one let me know please. Thanks!!\r\n\r\n    Stevie Mae\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2011 at 10:18 am\r\n\r\n    SOCIAL MEDIA:\r\n\r\n    Hi guys, we live in a really strange age where there is less and less separation between our personal lives and our work lives. This is especially true on our little island where we all are friends with each other in addition to being coworkers–a fact that I actually adore. It does, however, has its complications.\r\n\r\n    I can’t and don’t want to control what you post on Facebook or Twitter, etc., even if you post something about not liking your job or tourists or whatever. I certainly hope that you don’t make posts like this because I want all of you to LOVE your job and all of the visitors who come to this island and help us to be able to live here ourselves.\r\n\r\n    BUT, you have to be VERY CAREFUL about making sure that you don’t post anything relating to Guest Privacy or the inner workings of the properties. So please, before you post ANYTHING related to work, think twice.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for listening!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2011 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    May 7, 2011 Saturday 4pm to 6pm\r\n    It is time for our annual Cinco de Mayo Party.. Here at Earthbox motel & spa, out on the pool patio, open to our guests and the public we will be serving yummy authentic Mexican food, have the lovely Mexican dancers and a charming Flamenco Guitarist Ms. Amanda Brast…. Remember to let all guests know that we will be having this..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2011 at 3:50 pm\r\n\r\n    $$$$$$$$$$$\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we have some money missing.\r\n    I really need you to count the till at night, every night, and drop your cash. Please do this!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2011 at 9:18 am\r\n\r\n    What a bummer, Morgan. I’ll keep my eyes out.\r\n\r\n    Oh Angela, what a lovely letter you got from the coast guard guy from Port Angeles. It’s in Laura’s box, check it out. Great job! Thank you so much!\r\n\r\n    We’ll talk about May specials. Right now our bookings look so good that we almost don’t “need” one. We’ll go over the numbers tomorrow and look.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. What a great weekend we had, and with key cards and everything;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2011 at 11:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello.\r\n    My jacket with my sunglasses in the pocket was taken by a guest while I was closing the pool Saturday night. I had taken it off and set it, rolled up, on the table to do the chemicals. I had my back turned while opening the chem room door and when I came back out and noticed it missing, the guests were gone. Now it may have been an honest mistake because they had a bunch of clothes on the table and may have just grabbed it by accident. They were a heavy-set couple in their 40’s. He had dark hair and a beard. She had reddish-blond hair around shoulder length. They were wearing our robes so they must have been in either Building C or E. If you see anyone matching the description will you please ask them? Hopefully they will return it in the morning when they notice it not theirs. It’s the black Sterns fleece jacket I always wear. The sunglasses have an odd name but they are manufactured by Smith. Thanks.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2011 at 5:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi! Lots of calls for May reservations. Most folks are wondering if we are going to be offering a May Special. Do we know that yet??\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2011 at 2:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All!\r\n\r\n    Just FYI the Spa says it now will cost extra if a guest wants a pre-natal style massage. Also only certain practitioners over there are trained in it so pre-natal massages may not always be available due to scheduling.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2011 at 2:13 am\r\n\r\n    The new key machine is in! Woo! Downside though, we had to reprogram your login password so check with Cindy or Morgan if it isn’t working. Also, you may need a new master card as well.\r\n\r\n    Also just FYI, I pulled a bonehead move and accidentally over-filled the hot tub last night while working on it. This brought the temperature down quite a bit and it may still be reheating when you open. I put the “use if you choose” sign up but I just wanted to make sure you all know in case a guest asks.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Key machine did not arrive today :( , I sent an email and left a voice mail at Onity.. Hopefully it will arrive tomorrow.\r\n    If you have key issues, call Seth or I..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 1:54 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered more bottle openers from Island Paper today.\r\n    New key machine is not in yet, but hopefully will be here today..\r\n    Angela got a class schedule for the new XYZ Studio, I have taped it to the white board in the front office.. Let’s go ZUMBA everyone… :)\r\n    Seth is working on the decks in building D, so those rooms are closed out until Friday..\r\n    Happy Wednesday…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 12:15 pm\r\n\r\n    InnLink customer service:\r\n\r\n    If you have a problem with an InnLink reservation and need to contact the guest directly, you are going to first have to call InnLink at 800-525-5864 to find out who the travel agency is they booked through and get their telephone number.\r\n\r\n    I have found InnLink customer service to be very friendly and they are open 24 hours a day. Please let me know if you have any problems contacting them.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2011 at 10:35 am\r\n\r\n    Keys…\r\n    Super Seth is making keys for the rooms that are being occupied tonight. We now have special keys until we get the new key card machine yesterday… Ask if you have questions..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2011 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK RESERVATIONS\r\n\r\n    Very Important: When you process Innlink Reservations, will you please select “Innlink Reservations” for the Market Code. Thanks!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n    Wow today has been quite the day!! Having no key cards is a big pain in the butt, BUT we’ll get through it! (:\r\n\r\n    Laura or Cindy: Should we call tomorrows reservations and ask them if they would like to cancel their reservations or be moved to Bird Rock if possible?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 4:31 pm\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Oh boy, oh boy. When the ferry came, the key maker stopped working for me. Just stopped. Luckily Seth got on the phone with Onity, Raquel led our guests to their rooms. Seth accepted $175 charge from Onity (o.k.ed by me) to help us out. Apparently the whole thingy got erased. They think maybe from a power surge (it’s on a surge suppressor though, mhm). They are reloading our hotel info and then we can make keys again. Yeah!\r\n\r\n    CHECKING GUESTS IN/OUT IN PHONE SYSTEM\r\n    Yep, that started today. Re-read the memo on the white board and do it, please.\r\n\r\n    Have a great week everybody!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 11:47 am\r\n\r\n    Wednesday UPS – a package is going to be delivered on Wednesday from Global Industries. Please REFUSE SHIPMENT on this package. It is the wrong product.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2011 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    So I don’t post that often, so when I do, you really pay attention right?\r\n\r\n    Details, details, details…It’s all in the details. One of these details is that we want to be a very pet-friendly place. One of the ways that we do this is to treat our four-legged guests as well as we treat our two-legged guests. And, just like we get the names of all our human guests, we should get the names of all our pet guests and write it down so that we can write it on the pet policies form. Please also write the name down in the Housekeeper section because I am instituting a new housekeeper policy regarding pets as well.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2011 at 9:14 am\r\n\r\n    Aaron\r\n    You guys know Aaron, Morgan’s friend? He won a one night stay at Earthbox from Browns. He doesn’t have a gift certificate yet. So if he calls in the next few weeks, please make a reservation for him anyway or refer him to Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    ROOM PLACEMENT STRATEGIES\r\n    Did you read our review on Trip Advisor, where everything was super except the noise? There are things we can’t control, but right now in the off and shoulder season, there is no reason for us to get noise complaints. When checking guests in, don’t just leave them in the room the system assigns. Move them far away from each other with plenty of room in between, especially in building D.\r\n    If you are bored or while you go through upcoming reservations (which you should, every day, I found loose ends today when I did it), go to the availability page and just move rooms away from each other, please.\r\n\r\n    MORE STUFF\r\n    There is more important info in a memo hanging on the white board. Please read and initial. I wanted to keep it one page, so I didn’t write: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. YOU ROCK MY WORLD! But I meant it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2011 at 1:43 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING REPORT\r\n    When Raquel or Regino come to the office and give you the housekeeping report around 3 or 4, please update the housekeeping report in WRP. It’s very confusing for Raquel and us checking guests in the next day if you missed that step. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please remember to double check the clipper reservation notices in the basket on the back desk. You can’t check your own, but all others you can. Check the reservation in WRP (date, that it’s linked to Clipper account, that pricing is suppressed, that clipper number is written in guest comments, number of rooms and finally that room has been released, then check on clipper website that all info is correct and reservation is confirmed). Then date and initial and file the booking report.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Will be closed until Tuesday. Be aware of that when picking up the phones. 378-5800 is the line where Bird Rock phone calls come in. Also: please check the Bird Rock WRP over the next couple of days for online reservations.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2011 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    ROOM COFFEE\r\n    Sysco doesn’t carry Tully’s. We have to order that from FSA (info in my rolodex). I’ll order it Monday.\r\n    Thanks Kathy.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2011 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Weekend Everyone~ I left a message on Brad’s phone at Sysco saying, per Cindy, that we need 6 cases of Tully’s Reg.packets and 4 cases of Decaf-I never heard back from Brad on Friday. If someone can follow-up w/him(317-6300), I’d really appreciate it. I’m off for next 3 days…neener neener\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2011 at 8:34 am\r\n\r\n    USE OF ALARMS\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Great use of the alarms for massages to be booked and things to take care of. Just make sure to also leave notes in the guest comment section in WRP.\r\n    For example: alarm says “refund guest”. Please write in the guest comment section the story why we have to refund.\r\n    Alarm says “left message with guest about massage”, write in guest comment section “wants SBS massage, fee added, not confirmed, voucher needed.” And always write today’s date and your initials.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CANDLE 101\r\n    So the new candles burn just fine when you take the wax of the wick and trim the wick a tiny bit before lighting. Also please please remember to put a little water in the votive before you put a new candle in. It makes the cleaning so much easier. And please don’t put smudgy votives out. Soak them in hot water and get all the old wax out with a paper towel, before placing in lobby.\r\n\r\n    GUEST PHONES\r\n    Remember when guests called to say their message light is blinking and there was nothing we could do about it? It’s fixed, yeah!\r\n    What we need to do is check guests in and out in the phone system every day. This might seem tedious at first, but it will be easier in the long run.\r\n    Every morning print out your check-outs for the day and around 11 go to the back desk phone (not the phone console, the actual phone), hit the “check in/out” button and follow the instructions.\r\n    After every ferry rush check our guests in in the phone system by using the same button and following the instruction, then file the invoices away (put in white box in bathroom), so we only have in our drawer the invoices of recent guests which need to be checked into the phone system. The reason being, we can’t clear message, messages clear automatically when we check in another guest.\r\n    I know this must sound overwhelming. It’s really no big deal. Have us show you. Please ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Rock On!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2011 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHER BOOK & MENU GUIDE\r\n    Guys, while we still have a little breathing time every once in a while I would like to make sure our menu guides and voucher books are up to date. I know some of you have been working on it, but I don’t know where we are at.\r\n    Please blog and let me know where we are at and what else needs to be done (which restaurants are missing, which provider’s rate sheet needs to be renewed). And then do it. Pretty please.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR – MORGAN\r\n    Will you please double check the road scholar rooming lists tomorrow and check for early arrivals and stayovers? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2011 at 12:00 pm\r\n\r\n    INN-LINK\r\n    We quit Unirez by Pegasus and switched to InnLink for our third party reservations like Priceline, Orbitz, Expedia, etc.\r\n    All should work smoother from now on and the procedure is the same: take 10% deposit, confirm reservation.\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT: don’t ever cancel InnLink reservations. Guests who wish to cancel or alter their third party reservation need to do so with the company they booked with (i.e. call Travelocity directly).\r\n\r\n    Please ask Cindy, Laura or I if you have any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2011 at 6:19 pm\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCH TOURS & KAYAK TRIPS\r\n    Looks like most providers are changing their prices a bit this year. So it doesn’t get too confusing for us, I changed all prices in WRP as follows:\r\n    Whale Watch: $79 pp, $52 for kids under 12\r\n    Kayak Trip: 3 hour – $79 pp, 5-6 hour – $99pp\r\n    Let’s see once we get all the new info from everybody if we need to adjust that.\r\n    If a guest notices or complains about the price difference (for example SJS kept their prices at $75)go ahead and adjust, but in general it won’t be necessary to adjust for every single provider. Too much info for us to keep track of.\r\n    But note: the zodiac trip at Western Prince ($99, $76 for kids under 6-12) and the price for kids with Capt Maya ($65) need to be manually adjusted.\r\n    If you are confused, please take a second and check out the provider you chose on the web. They all list their prices there.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2011 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN AIR TOURS – SCENIC FLIGHTS\r\n\r\n    Begins in May (Memorial Day) thru mid to late October. Fares start at $59/person. Phone for reservations is 378-7717.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Kathy!!! Steffi will be calling you today about the folio you had called her about yesterday. Cheers and have a super great day!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 12:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, Laura wants us to all be making sure when we put on Slacker Radio, to then click on Thievery Corp.Mix for appropriate lobby music ;)\r\n    Also, it seems like we are needing to double-check the dishes as they’re coming out of dishwasher at Birdrock-It doesn’t look like they’re coming out as clean (like coffee stains and jam left on dishes.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 9:48 am\r\n\r\n    Please do not reserve ANY reservations for anyone that is requesting that we do donations for them UNLESS Laura or I have given you the okay.. :)\r\n    Thank you :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2011 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY – RELAY FOR LIFE\r\n    We donated 6 room nights to the American Cancer Society, not valid 4/30/11 to 9/15/11. Dina Currier, their community relationship manager, will call in and reserve a Sky place during valid times when she comes up to work on Relay for Life. Please make her a complimentary reservation then. Ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Also: guests who come up for Relay for Life get a 10% discount.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2011 at 1:41 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFF BUSINESS CARDS\r\n    I have my own business cards, yeah! So if I’m not here and folks are inquiring about group bookings or (let’s hope not) need to speak to a manager, please hand them one of my cards. They are on my desk.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2011 at 10:45 am\r\n\r\n    PET POLICIES\r\n    When a guest makes a reservation for a pet friendly room:\r\n    Ask for pet’s name\r\n    At check-in, have guest fill out a pet registration form and file with invoices.\r\n    Hand guest our pet policies (write name of pet on it) and a doggie bone.\r\n    Those forms & bones can be found in the third drawer of the back desk.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    We had complaints this morning of too much chlorine in the pool. Eyes stinging, trouble breathing, a dark blue swim suit turned light blue, a black swim suit turned brown. Cindy, let’s check in with Seth & Morgan and see if we can use less chemicals.\r\n\r\n    BEACH CRUISERS\r\n    When checking out a beach cruiser, please have EACH guest sign a release form, the legal guardian of minors has to sign for them and print the minor’s name on the release form.\r\n    Then we need to hold on to a credit card or ID as long as the guest is out biking. Paper clip credit card to release forms and file in “cruisers out” file on back desk.\r\n    When guest comes back, give back credit card and file form with invoices.\r\n    Kids under 18 need to wear a helmet; it’s the law. But offer a helmet to all guests.\r\n\r\n    CASH\r\n    When you drop money, please use the small manila envelopes on top of the safe. Write your initials, today’s date and what’s in the envelope (cash, check, receipts) in small on the envelope, so we can empty them, cross out what you wrote and re-use them.\r\n\r\n    CURRENCY\r\n    We DON’T take personal checks as payment. Only credit cards (visa, master, amex), cash and traveler’s checks. Checks only with Cindy, Laura or my approval.\r\n\r\n    Gosh, I have a lot to say today. Thanks for bearing with me. Thanks for all your hard work. You rock my world!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys, Welcome to a busy Friday for me tonight! Time flew by! So the Lavendera Spa folks want to make sure that 1 of us tells (I mean asks)the gardeners to clear a way to the hose they need to water plants with. It is being blocked by a lovely rhody! Thanks, Kathy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2011 at 2:19 pm\r\n\r\n    MAGNESIUM?\r\n    Which wonderful person put the magnesium products in my box? Thank you so much. Looks like something I can rub onto the dog, the husband and myself and we’ll all get prettier and healthier, yeah! Thank you!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2011 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! I just wanted to let you know that Western Prince is up and running for the season. They’re wanting to do a trip every day but it does depend on the number of bookings they get. They have also spotted Orcas in the area on and off recently even though it is still early in the season.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2011 at 4:22 pm\r\n\r\n    A guest in the Sea Place recommended we have steak knives or some sort of sharp knife for cutting.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2011 at 3:38 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Our hot tub filter will be fixed, so we don’t have all thats and in the tub all the time. This will happen on Wednesday April 6th. So on April 6th and April 7th we won’t have a hot tub. Please let our guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2011 at 9:08 am\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    Just a reminder: we’ll have a mandatory all front desk staff meeting this Friday, 3/25 at noon at Earthbox. Myah will come at 12:30, so we can start with EB only stuff first and don’t bore her to death. Stevie will be out of town.\r\n    Everybody else: see you there!\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2011 at 11:40 am\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We’ll go over Clipper procedures during our staff meeting next Friday. For now, when you get a booking report from Clipper via email, please open the Acrobat Attachment and print it out. Put in Cindy’s or my box.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2011 at 8:23 am\r\n\r\n    FRONT DOOR KEY\r\n    Dude, I almost had a heart attack this morning, when my key didn’t open the front door. But worry not: the dead bolt key now works for both, dead bolt and front door lock. And the door knob is fancy, yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2011 at 1:19 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL REMINDER\r\n    When selling a special over the phone, please don’t select the special as the room rate in WRP, rather choose the rack rate and manually adjust the price.\r\n\r\n    ALARM 101\r\n    When a guest books an ad-on on an online reservation, please make an alarm and keep contacting the guest until whatever the guest requested is booked, fee added, confirmed, voucher made.\r\n\r\n    When a guest merely wants to be called about an ad-on (i.e. massage – I’m thinking, call me), we make an alarm to call, then we call the guest once, then we turn the alarm off. We don’t want to seem pushy or upselly.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, guys. Also: please don’t forget our front desk staff meeting on Friday, 3/25 at noon in the Earthbox lobby.\r\n\r\n    German lesson of the day: Atomkraft? Nein Danke!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 16th, 2011 at 8:50 am\r\n\r\n    Mr. San Juan:\r\n\r\n    We have donated the use of our pool as an award for the Mr. San Juan competition. Dan Deshon will come by and pick up the gift certificate. The deal is, they can use the pool “subject to availability”, see expiration dates on gift certificate (doesn’t include summer).\r\n\r\n    Dan Deshon Pool Party:\r\n\r\n    They will be having a small pool party on Saturday, March 26th. Please welcome them and give them a key, etc.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2011 at 6:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! Kathy and I noticed a yucky smell back by Cindy and Laura’s office and found that that box of oranges were all moldy! :( We saved what we could and got rid of the rest.\r\n    - Stevie Mae\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2011 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    And remember:\r\n    F3 is your friend.\r\n    pressing the “F3″ button opens a search window and you can search the blog for key words, like “cancellation”. Neat stuff!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2011 at 2:02 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m going through reservations and noticed a couple of things:\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    When adding a massage, ww, kayak tour, etc. the three magic words I would like to see in the guest remarks are:\r\n    fee added\r\n    confirmed\r\n    voucher made\r\n    (alright it’s five words:)\r\n    And variations on that: so if a guest added a massage to their reservation online and you called and left a message asking when she would like to have it, the magic words would be:\r\n    fee added\r\n    left msg with guest\r\n    voucher needed\r\n    …and an alarm to follow up on this.\r\n    Once you got a hold of the guest and know the time and date, talked to the spa and made the reservation, and let the guest know when the massage is and the cancellation policy, the magic words are:\r\n    fee added\r\n    confirmed\r\n    voucher needed\r\n    …and an alarm for the voucher. Like that. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n    CANCELLATIONS\r\n    To properly cancel a reservation (say 10 days before the arrival, when we just keep the 10%deposit) please\r\n    1)cancel the reservation in WRP\r\n    2)cancel all add-ons and take charges off bill\r\n    3)apply cancellation fee by dividing 10% deposit by 1.078 (that’s the B4 tax total)\r\n    4)send cancellation email to guest\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please write only in the subject line of alarms. All alarms should start with the arrival date of the reservation it pertains to.\r\n\r\n    Thank you guys. It was wonderful to have you all in one room the other day, my team! What a treat. We’ll have a great season and you rock!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2011 at 5:55 pm\r\n\r\n    The back office phone is now connected to it’s headset thanks to a little determination and our friend GOOGLE!!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2011 at 2:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS in the summer.\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    At this point, guests wanting to stay on a Friday or Saturday night in July, August or the first weekend in September, need to stay at least two nights. You can make an exception on the Friday nights at this point, but please don’t make exceptions on the Saturdays. If you have any questions, ask me.\r\n\r\n    p.s. This does not apply to Clipper bookings or Road Scholar guests wanting to extend a night. Oh, or for guests who are on a multi-day kayak trip and are coming for just one night at the beginning and just one night at the end of a trip.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 7th, 2011 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    MARCH 11 SPRING STREET PLAY “MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING”\r\n    Folks who come for the play and stay with us get rooms (Sky, Earth, Water) for $99 plus tax per night.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2011 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! Both vending machines are not functioning. Had to refund $$ and guest was not happy. Who do we call for service?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 4:28 pm\r\n\r\n    MARCH & APRIL SPECIALS\r\n    Check out our specials page on the website for our March & April special. We called it “Spring Splash” and it is what we were doing: $129 for a Water Place, $99 if you stay 2 nights or more, $149 for a Sky or Earth Place, $119 if you stay 2 nights or more.\r\n\r\n    Now: when you take a phone reservation, advertise those specials, but don’t select the special when making a phone reservation. Select regular rate and adjust room rate accordingly (unless guest says he was on website and saw special there). This way we’ll know who is actually reading our website.\r\n\r\n    REPEAT GUESTS\r\n    When making a phone reservation please always ask the guest if he stayed with us before and if he has, please select “repeat guest” as market code.\r\n    We are really trying to figure out where our guests heard from us and how we spend our advertising budget. Help us do it right!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 9:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey!! Duck Soup just emailed us, they will be open April 8th and I updated the menu in the restaurant guide!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 9:26 am\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Please make some. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    10% OFF KEY CARD SPECIAL\r\n    Just a clarification: our guests get 10% off their next stay upon showing us their key card ONLY off rack rates, not good with any other special.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2011 at 9:24 am\r\n\r\n    And our weekend super hero front desk goddess award goes to\r\n\r\n    ANGELA\r\n\r\n    yeah!!!!\r\n\r\n    who worked a double shift, while not feeling well and had 33 check-ins, a million phone calls and handled it, of course, like a pro!\r\n\r\n    Thank you Angela, you rock my world!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2011 at 10:25 am\r\n\r\n    EARTHBOX KEY CARD SPECIAL\r\n    Tell our guests upon check in: if you keep your key card and present it to us on your next visit, we’ll take 10% off your room rate. One key card discount per reservation. Cool.\r\n\r\n    PERSONAL CALLS\r\n    Please have all your peeps call in on the 378-4000. That way we’ll see who is calling on the caller ID and don’t have to interrupt guest calls or rush to the phone with our mouths full to get that call. Also: please limit your personal calls to the absolute minimum. Emergencies, a quick call to make an appointment or to confirm a lunch date. Phone calls are picking up and “running around like a chicken with no head” time is approaching, aaaahhhhhhh. No, this is good, this is why we are here and don’t forget to have fun.\r\n\r\n    PHONE LOG\r\n    Cindy is working on a final version to log our daily calls. We won’t count personal calls, but all other calls will need to be logged. We’ll show you how. This way we can better plan for staffing.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. This is going to be a great year. You should see the reservations we have on the books already. Uiiihhhh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2011 at 11:00 am\r\n\r\n    MANDATORY FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    on Friday, March 11, noon, at Earthbox. Short and sweet meeting about our new brand. Yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2011 at 10:43 am\r\n\r\n    WT?\r\n    Somebody is stealing water from our laundry room. They come equipped with hose and everything.\r\n    So, keep your eyes out. And: we changed the laundry room door so it functions like the pool door. Every guest can open it with their key and it locks itself at 10:00PM.\r\n    It’s o.k. to leave the laundry room open during the day when we are here. But let’s close it in the evenings.\r\n    Hey, this way guests can also see the sign which says when to stop doing laundry. It’s all good!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 13th, 2011 at 11:46 am\r\n\r\n    W4 2011\r\n    Hey everybody,\r\n    I put a W4 form for 2011 in each of your inboxes. Please fill out and put in Cindy’s box.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2011 at 1:55 pm\r\n\r\n    EXPEDIA\r\n    If you need to contact them for a reservation (I really hope you don’t, oh man), their vendor number is:\r\n    877-expedia\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2011 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE VAN\r\n    We will make the current shuttle van parking spot into a handicapped parking spot. The van will be parked in front of building D or up by A for now. Once we start hopping in the summer the van will be parked by Cindy & Laura’s office in front of the spa.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 4th, 2011 at 9:31 am\r\n\r\n    NEW WIFI PASSWORD\r\n    playful1\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 13th, 2011 at 10:47 am\r\n\r\n    CANCELLATIONS\r\n    Just a reminder: if you cancel a reservation, make sure you cancel all their add-ons as well (massages, whale watch, flowers, etc.), because we will have to pay for those.\r\n\r\n    You can’t cancel a UNIREZ reservation. The guest needs to cancel with whoever he booked directly, otherwise we will have to pay commission.\r\n\r\n    After canceling a reservation, apply a cancellation fee in the amount already paid: guest payment, divided by 1.078 (that’s the B4 tax amount) and send the guest a cancellation email.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered a box. Should be printed next week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 10th, 2011 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    WELCOME MORGAN AND KATHY\r\n    I miss you so much. Have a nice mellow shift. Call me at home if you need something.\r\n\r\n    Can one of you please take down the x-mas lights and cedar branches on the railing outside of the lobby, please?\r\n\r\n    Will you mop the lobby floor, especially if you used the de-icer, and vacuum, please?\r\n\r\n    FAX FOR LAURA\r\n    If you receive a fax for Laura, please put in my box. It’s important.\r\n\r\n    $50 OFF COUPON\r\n    Guests are starting to make reservations with those. Apparently Skagit Valley sent one to each Road Scholar participant.\r\n    The coupon is only good off the regular rate, not good with any other discounts. Expiration 5/13/11.\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR\r\n    Just a reminder: road scholar participants get a 10% discount off our regular rates if they arrive a day early or tag on a night after their program. Make sure to write in the HK notes: Road Scholar early arrival or Road Scholar stayover. Also make an alarm for a month before their arrival, which stays: Road Scholar, make sure guest stays in same room. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 7th, 2011 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    TANNER-MCLEAN WEDDING 7/29\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    We’ll have a big wedding group in July. Guests will call in individually and make reservations for however many nights they want. Just make sure you link those reservations to the group.\r\n\r\n    FEBRUARY SPECIAL\r\n    We have a LOVE special in February. $129 for Sky, Earth, Water or $99 for the same rooms if you stay 2 nights or longer. Specials are in WRP.\r\n\r\n    JAN MURPHY – WILD AT HEART – 2/5\r\n    Jan will have a workshop here on 2/5. All participants will get rooms for $99. They’ll probably ask for the Wild at Heart rate.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    January 2nd, 2011 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody-\r\n\r\n    Mac got the decorations off the top of the tree for me :) Unfortunately, the star lights in the gift shop windows can only be removed after we take down the blinds, which I don’t know how to do and I worry about breaking them so I’m leaving it to someone more skilled with tools. Other than that, have a great month!!! See you all again in February :)\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    January 2nd, 2011 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    DECORATIONS\r\n\r\n    Got all of the front lights from windows except for giftshop. I couldn’t figure out how they were connected from window to window. :-( Also got tree ornaments wrapped and packed. Will take down tree lights if I’m able to.\r\n\r\n    FIRE\r\n\r\n    Okay, maybe it’s just me (and Regino)…….but we COULD NOT get the fire started this morning. Wood not dry enough?? And if there is any cardboard going to recycle, let’s keep it for fire starter. It works fabulously.\r\n\r\n    bye til february!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 30th, 2010 at 3:12 pm\r\n\r\n    YUK SEWER\r\n    We have a bit of a sewer back up in building A. Only 107 and 108 are affected. Seth called a plumber. The problem should be fixed by next Wednesday. The rooms are blocked out until then.\r\n\r\n    328\r\n    Is dirty, I moved guests. Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Seth will be off island tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY\r\n    Angela, Halley, will you be our grinches and start taking down the X-mas decorations, please? Boxes are in luggage room. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back. I missed you guys!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2010 at 8:38 am\r\n\r\n    Coffee is ordered for lobby :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2010 at 5:30 pm\r\n\r\n    EAT!\r\n    COHO brought us delicious homemade cookies to thank us for our referrals. We have chips, salsa, hummus & crackers in the back and, last but definitely not least: some of Mac’s outstanding smoked salmon in the fridge. Eat up!\r\n\r\n    105 – HIKING BOOTS\r\n    Guest left hiking boots. Raquel will bring them to the lobby tomorrow. Guest is on Orcas and will come and pick them up in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\n    314 – KID’S SHOES\r\n    Guest left kid’s shoes. Raquel found them. Left msg with guest.\r\n\r\n    Cindy will be out of town but reachable by phone until Monday. I’ll be back next Thursday (also have my phone).\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas everybody. You rock my world!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2010 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    JANUARY\r\n    When you make a reservation for a guest arriving in January, please let the guest know & write in the confirmation letter that our January office hours are 9AM to 5PM. Please also make a little note in the guest’s WRP file that he knows our open hours. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY SPECIAL\r\n    Our January special will be: any room (except of Wind Place) for $99 plus tax per night with the booking of any spa treatment. Guests will need to call for that special, they can’t book it on the website. Make sure to set up spa treatment right then when you have the guest on the phone.\r\n\r\n    AARP/AAA/Military discounts\r\n    As you know we officially don’t have them, but we do kind of. If a guest calls asking for any of those discounts, say:”We would love to give you a 10% discount for that.” BUT only on regular rates, NOT in addition to any special. Come Summer, make it more like 5%, please.\r\n\r\n    RADIO TRADE SCRIP WOMAN\r\n    O.K. there is a future guest, she has $300 in radio trade scrip. I talked to her at length twice about the fine print: radio trade scrip is only good on regular rates, NOT on specials, tax needs to be paid in cash or cc. She will stay with 5 people in an Earth Place and wants to negotiate a better deal than the regular rate ($167), says the rules aren’t fair, etc. Please adhere to the trade scrip rules. Ask Cindy or Laura if you have any questions. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for the fun party last night. I had a blast. Love you.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2010 at 1:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, if any guests are wondering which restaurants are open over Christmas, here it is-on Christmas Eve (Fri.)the following are open: Downriggers, Rumor Mill(only until 3pm) & Rocky Bay(until 2 or 3pm). On Christmas Day the only place open is Coho’s and they’re almost sold out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 18th, 2010 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE CHANGES\r\n    Halley, Morgan and Kathy, please have a look at the schedule. We closed Bird Rock Sunday and Monday and we had to cut some shifts. Sorry, guys. But the following week we are hopping!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 16th, 2010 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    THE DEAL WITH BUILDING E\r\n    The roof is leaking in building E. 309 is not affected by this. The most affected is 310 where the leak seems to be above the bed (fun). I blocked those rooms out until next week. We have someone requesting 308 next week. Use you best judgment. If it’s raining, apologize and move the guest, please.\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN OUTFITTERS\r\n    Brian called to let us know that they are open for business in January. So if somebody wants a kayak tour, leave them a message and he will confirm it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2010 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Ho Ho Hello all,\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of easy things:\r\n\r\n    1) Be sure to check the water level in the tree every day. It’s a thirsty bugger.\r\n\r\n    2) With Xmas coming, a lot of personal packages will start being delivered along with the usual business materials. In order to minimize the chance of visiting staff offspring seeing boxes that might contain gifts, please place all incoming parcels in the back office until L or C can sort them. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 9th, 2010 at 3:08 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATE SPECIAL\r\n    We are having a 10% off sale on gift certificates. if someone buys one online, it’s calculated automatically. Do you all know how to process online gift certificates (they come through email via Boomtime)?\r\n    If someone calls and buys a $100 gift certificate, charge him $90 and put $10 in as a voucher, mention special in guest comments. Ask Cindy, Laura or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I’m listening to “Highway to hell” by ACDC, cool.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 6th, 2010 at 4:58 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK WRP\r\n    Please check the Bird Rock WRP several times during your shift and process new reservations. We are only open on the weekends, so also remember that you’ll get phone inquiries for Bird Rock on the 5800 line.\r\n\r\n    FUZZY FRIEND\r\n    Dave and Seth are looking for our fuzzy friend in my office. It’s a mess. Hopefully tomorrow we’ll know more.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there. Happy happy shift.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2010 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON\r\n    the decorating contest, Yeah!\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers tomorrow. We are getting a lot of gift certificate inquiries for the holidays.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 2nd, 2010 at 4:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Wanna boat ride?\r\n    Naknek Charters is going on their sea lion tour on Monday at 1PM. They invited us to come and see the sea. If you are interested, give them a ring: Peggy – 378-9288.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 30th, 2010 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    Okay, I did a little market research and found out that customers don’t like looking through lots of specials, so I’ve changed our December special to read:\r\n\r\n    Dazzling December ~\r\n    Give yourself the gift of calm. Celebrate the Island Light Festival with us, do your holiday shopping away from the malls, have one of our beautiful beaches all for yourself. Stay any two nights in December and get the second night free. Only have one night? Come anyway and get any room (except the Wind Place) for just $129 per night. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).\r\n\r\n    In WRP, there are two specials, so that people can book online easier, there is the Dazzling December-Multiple Nights, and the Dazzling December-One Night. It will be difficult for a guest who is staying for more than two nights to figure out how to book online, so they will hopefully call. Here’s the deal on that: If someone is staying for three nights…they would get the first night at full price, the second night for free and the third night for $129. If they are staying for four nights, they’d get the two night special two times. Make sense?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2010 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    YEAH, Steph, Hiiiiiii! We miss you!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The new schedule will be up on Thursday. I have some calls in to people with reservations at BR trying to talk them into staying up here, so we can close BR midweek. If one of those guests call, please have Cindy move the reservation.\r\n    Stephanie Walker Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2010 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    Hi! It’s me. The other Steph. Just sitting here with Malcolm on my lap, thinking about you guys and wanted to say hello. Frozen pipes brings back memories. I miss you all and the Earthbox. So much snow! None here yet. I’m sure Malcolm would have loved to have gone to work with me at the front desk. Another life, I suppose. We will be back at least for a visit. Mark my words.\r\n\r\n    I hope today is smooth sailing with lots of bookings.\r\n    Love from Chicago,\r\n    Steph\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    November 28th, 2010 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    Hellooo, looks like Bldg D is back in service thanks to our local plumber.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2010 at 2:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thanksgiving! Well, I thought it’d be quiet, but turns out I was wrong. :-)\r\n\r\n    Bldg. D is closed temporarily due to a broken water pipe under the cedar room. I’ve moved the one guest that was checking into a Sun Place Pet today to Rm 314 with Cindy’s permission. Housekeeping has been informed of the pet. Another guest was booked into a Sun Place on the 28th and I have moved them to a Sea Place as well. (if fixed before then we could move them back to Sun Place Room) Bldg. D has been put into “Maintenance” through November…..so if the pipe is fixed before then please remove from M status.\r\n\r\n    Guess that’s all the good news I have. Hope you had a yummy Thanksgiving Day!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    ANGELA WEDNESDAY\r\n    Will you please make sure to write the correct opening hours for Thanksgiving (10:00AM to 4:00PM) on the door sign before you leave on Wednesday night? Thank you!\r\n\r\n    HEATER\r\n    Please leave the lobby heater (not the space heaters, the one outside the front desk) at 65 when you leave, at least as long as we are having this cold snap. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Stay warm everybody!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 4:06 pm\r\n\r\n    RESTAURANTS OPEN ON THANKSGIVING\r\n    Bluff – set menu, $50 per person\r\n    Downriggers – regular menu plus Thanksgiving specials\r\n    COHO – fully booked, only take reservations for waiting list\r\n\r\n    That’s it. Back Door, Place and Mc Millens are closed. Waiting to hear from Vinny’s.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 11:14 am\r\n\r\n    Two new specials are up for December, the first is for two nights, the second is for just one night.\r\n\r\n    “Dazzling December ~ Give yourself the gift of calm. Celebrate the Island Light Festival with us, do your holiday shopping away from the malls, have one of our beautiful beaches all for yourself. Stay any two nights in December and get the second night free. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).”\r\n\r\n    “Last Minute Getaway ~ Wanna give yourself the gift of calm but can only get away for one night? Come anyway and get any room (except the Wind Place) for just $129 per night. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).”\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2010 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    JANUARY CLOSURE\r\n    Just to clarify: we will be open at Earthbox through January.

You know those lovely, yummy candles we have floating around these days? You know, the ones that start to smoke when their wicks get too long and they leave a black ring around the top of the glass and the wick gets all goobery?? Pretty please, before you light them, can you please trim the wick so they don’t get too long and turn into yucky, icky candles instead of lovely, yummy ones?\r\n\r\n    Thanks for humoring me.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2010 at 3:43 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Starting 10/1 the spa will be open from noon to 5 Monday through Friday. 9-5 on the weekends.\r\n\r\n    EXPLORITAS\r\n    Are now called Elderhostel again or Road Scholar, either works.

The December one will be an underwater tree decorating. Is that cool or what?\r\n    Guests who are going diving with them on those dates get a special rate with us. In WRP go to the month, group folios, see notes. Questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    STAFF DINNER\r\n    Oh cool. Thank you Cindy and Laura! What a wonderful thing to do for us. You guys are the Bestestest!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 23rd, 2010 at 11:52 am\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT CHANGES **** :)\r\n\r\n    1.

Please make sure to let all check in ’s know our schedule and make arrangements for them if they are checking in after that time..\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have any questions..\r\n\r\n    Thanks,\r\n\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Uh, so much to say tonight:\r\n    FANS IN ROOMS\r\n    HK took all the box fans out of the rooms today. And all our guests are calling to get them back. Coolish or not, it is still warm in the rooms. Will you please let HK know NOT to remove the fans I brought back tonight. Also: if somebody calls you for a box fan, there are in the upstairs HK closet (walk in, turn right, open closet door) in building A.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK HAS NO INTERNET\r\n    Hey guys. Our sister has no internet. Cindy and Laura will find a way to fix this soon.\r\n    For now the guys and gals down there will take phone numbers from guests who wish to make a reservation, then call us up here and we’ll need to call those guests back and make the reservation from up here. If it’s too complicated, please make sure to leave those phone numbers for Morgan on Wednesday, so we don’t loose those guests.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY 10/3\r\n    Laura o.k.ed a kid’s b-day party for a friend (Tanja)in our pool house that day.

It’s important for all of us to be there and talk about the future.\r\n\r\n    MY PHONE MESSAGES\r\n    Guys, we need to find a better way to take phone messages for me. I had many calls on my phone today after working at Bird Rock all week for things already past or group inquiries which could have already found a different place to stay. From now on: if somebody calls for me, will you please take the message and email it to me? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, Laura and I planning something fantastic for you, because you rock our world!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 1:16 pm\r\n\r\n    First-Aid kit has been restocked w/thermometer, advil, neosporin, and lots of band-aids and other things-it’s in the bathroom.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2010 at 8:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi! Looks like we’re starting to get calls for reservations in November and folks are looking for special rates. Are we going to offer a special for Thanksgiving?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2010 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE SPECIAL SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN\r\n    What Kathy said:) And: this special is not in WRP, please manually adjust the room rate for runners to $99. This special does not have a 2 night minimum.\r\n\r\n    ISLAND DAZZLE\r\n    We lowered the Island Dazzle (midweek, 2 night minimum) to $99 plus tax per night. Entered in WRP\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR\r\n    We have a promotion going on the Ttrip Advisor page for 10% off any room any night regardless of length of stay. This promotion is not in WRP. If a guest makes a phone reservation and asks for the Trip Advisor discount, please manually adjust the nightly room rate. Please also use “Trip Advisor” as the market code for those reservations.\r\n\r\n    Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    Miss you guys.

Please let our night managers know.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Khai or Cindy, can you print out some more spa voucher, please? We seem to be low.\r\n    All of us: please make a handful of spa vouchers each shift. It is so not nice when you have to make one on the fly and we are all out.\r\n\r\n    BLOGGING?\r\n    I’m the Bird Rocking girl for the next couple of weeks. Will you guys please blog a thing or two everyday so I know what’s what?\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    Hang in there, Gorgeous, for your double shift. I can’t believe you are leaving us. I will miss you so much. Thank you for all your hard work. Good luck and have fun and be good, but have fun, but nothing dangerous, and learn a lot!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2010 at 12:39 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered more printer paper 9-9-10, they will bring it to us on 9-10-10..

I think we might need to print some out–didn’t see anymore in the basket. I’ll try to make a bunch on Sunday when I’m on the night shift.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2010 at 3:18 pm\r\n\r\n    SAUNA\r\n    Is reset. Seth will talk to Dave tomorrow to get a new relay switch.\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Don’t forget to ship the you know what today, starts with “p”, in plastic bag underneath our inboxes……\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2010 at 3:13 am\r\n\r\n    The sauna does not appear to be heating up. I don’t know If it is related to the recent power outage or not. The control panel seems fine and no breakers have been flipped. We may need to call Dave or West Mechanical to take a look.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2010 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    POTATO\r\n    O.K. so Raquel was approached by a guy to please put a potato between the sheets in room 325. He is playing a joke on the guests in there. So if the guests run into the lobby furious over the unwanted vegetable add-on, please explain: this was a joke from your friend. I sure hope, they find it hilarious.\r\n\r\n    206\r\n    Has a broken sink. This needs to be fixed before Tuesday. Please give Seth a heads up on Monday. Guest moved, room blocked out.\r\n\r\n    $50 SUPER COOL GUEST SAVINGS CARDS\r\n    Our guests (only the super cool ones) are starting to redeem those. Just a reminder: they are ONLY good on rack rates, can not be combined with any other specials. If a guest books a “special rate” or “limited offer” room, calculate room rate from rack rate (as in: rack rate is $150, limited offer room rate is $130, room after $50 off coupon would be $100 – $50 off rack rate). Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    Other than that we are doing great. Had another add-on mishap, but the ultimate guest whispering team Brynn & Steff straightened it all out. We’ll do better next time, right?\r\n\r\n    Happy end of the season everybody. Have a great vacation Brynn and Halley. Love you all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2010 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Guys, we had 2 reservations today with lot’s of add-ons and nothing was booked. Plus it’s difficult to book things this weekend so late in the game. Please please please check all online reservations very very carefully for massages, whale watch tours, kayak trips and Romance packages. Do it for your coworkers.\r\n    Also: whenever you have a minute to breeze, go through upcoming reservations and make sure we didn’t miss anything. Our season is almost over. Just hang in there for a little longer. Eyes wide open, brain on, go!!!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2010 at 10:22 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n\r\n    Okay, now I remember this happened last upgrade. So for now, all existing reservations that were made before August 31, 2010 may have a 1 cent overage or shortage. If this happens please post the difference to payment selection “voucher”\r\n\r\n    This should not happen to reservations that were made after the upgrade.\r\n\r\n    **I just noticed the blog clock is off, it is actually only 10:38 am.. That threw me for a minute..\r\n\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2010 at 10:18 am\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS**\r\n    We have our Island Dazzle up and running, starting Sunday September 5, 2010 book two nights between a Sunday and a Thursday night and get a nightly rate of $149.00 on either Earth, Sky or Water..\r\n    Thanks to Khai we now have our new SJ Health Club vouchers.. Check them out and offer them up… $15.00 for a day at the fitness club 17 yrs old and up, children the age of 6 yrs to 16 are $10.00, children under the age of 5 are free.\r\n    Please treat them as you would any other voucher.\r\n    Enjoy the sunny day… It is perfect back to school weather..:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2010 at 12:37 pm\r\n\r\n    I made some new vouchers for the health club. If anyone wants to use the pool or gym there, it costs $15 per person for a full day pass. Just add the charge like we add any other “adventure” voucher. The vouchers are in the voucher folder :)\r\n    kathy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 5:20 pm\r\n\r\n    We need to make some Earthbox lodging vouchers\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    Okay, the booking options are fixed back to the way they were.. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    We just updated our WRP, you may not even notice much, but please check it out. One thing I noticed was that now it shows which guest are in, when you view the main calendar page.\r\n    The other thing is that now when an online reservation comes in it does not show the details of the extra’s they are interested in on their main customer page, you have to see if there are additional costs and then go into their profile and see what they have selected. I have an email into WRP, and am requesting this to be changed back to the old way, so I will let you know if they can.\r\n    Under miscellaneous on the left hand side of the WRP page, click on New Features to see what they have added. You can also look at the training videos there also. Just to refresh of course :)\r\n    What do you think of this weather, it tells me it is time for school…:)\r\n    Have a good Tuesday..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Our beach cruisers took a beating today. I think we had 7 fallen soldiers. Morgan brought them to island Bicycle for repair. they will call us when they are ready.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Will you please call Rochelle from Victoria Clipper 206-448-5000 tomorrow when you get in. They don’t know who’s cellphone you dropped off and I don’t either. Thank you, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2010 at 1:04 pm\r\n\r\n    DINING VOUCHERS\r\n    Great job, Halley! Cindy will write McMillens a check on Monday.\r\n    Just to make sure we all know: the restaurants participating in our dining voucher program are: Back Door Kitchen, COHO, Vinnie’s, The Place, The Bluff & Duck Soup Inn.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE WEEK OF 9/6\r\n    We needed to make some changes to the schedule. Affected are Kathy, Angela, Khaili, Brynn & Morgan. Please look closely. Thanks for hanging in there for the final sprint to the end of the season. You all rock!!!!!!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2010 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Y’all!!!\r\n    The guy I accidentally double booked at Birdrock never showed up over there tonight. We had an emergency hold room here for him but since he was a no show we gave it to someone else. Also, some guests were either misinformed about how dining credits worked or just spaced out on the restrictions. They tried to use theirs out at McMillan’s. The server said she would honor it but we have to write them a $75 check. The guests were still sitting at their table so I OK’d that, didn’t know what else to do. Let me know if there’s a problem with that solution and I will help try to work it out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2010 at 10:07 am\r\n\r\n    Champagne has been ordered from Market Chef. Should be here Tuesday. Half come here, half goes to BR. Thanks!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2010 at 7:22 pm\r\n\r\n    I put a purple bicycle on the side(by the van)- it has a flat tire, thanks, Kathy\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2010 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys– just to let you know, Lakedale has a Cabin available on Friday and a room in the lodge open on Saturday..so refer people out there if they are asking about availability this weekend!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 10:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Water\r\n    We are out of water for the lobby. I believe Steffi said that she left a message with Island Water to get more but please call again tomorrow (Tuesday). The two water bottles in the back office belong to Ace. We need to return them and let them know “Zia” has brought them back. There is a $7 deposit on each bottle they will take off our account.\r\n    Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Off camping. Rattlesnakes and bears and beers, oh my.\r\n    Be good. Love you.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 4:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Map paper ordered\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2010 at 10:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin!\r\n    Lots o’ fun things to pass on.\r\n    – There are two bikes behind the house. The black one is fixed and needs to be returned to BR. The purple one needs to go to Island Bicycles due to a loose bottom bracket and sketchy braking. They may be related.\r\n    – If they can’t drop them off when we are open, 302 will be leaving a few bags by the door. They will be back on Thursday to grab them.\r\n    – Had my first crash of the TV system. I think it just got too hot in there and the breaker blew. Whee.\r\n    – If it hasn’t been ordered yet we need to phone in for another case of map paper.\r\n    I think that’s about it. BTW could someone please turn off the heat?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2010 at 5:05 pm\r\n\r\n    OUTDOOR ODYSSEY\r\n    Clark from Outdoor odyssey checked in with me today. We had a little glitch with #2456413 at BR. They didn’t have that couple on the books at all, the couple didn’t know anything about the tour, etc.\r\n    Whenever you book an adventure, just write in the guest remarks with whom you made the booking (has kayak with OO on 9/14, 10AM, fee added, confirmed 9booking made with Clark), voucher made).\r\n    Clark will also bring by a flier we will attach to OO vouchers which explains what to bring, wear, expect, etc. Those fliers will be kept with the vouchers in the voucher logs.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2010 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy….\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Our wifi is slow. We are in the middle of upgrading. Please ask our guests for patience. All shall be wonderful next week.\r\n\r\n    SODA MACHINE POOL\r\n    Seems to be out of things. Left msg with pepsi guy. Cindy, can you call him again tomorrow, please?\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    The older one keeps eating folks’ money and not doing the job. I put an out of order sign on it. Any word when the washer we ordered will be installed?\r\n\r\n    TONER\r\n    In printer in my office is almost empty. Morgan, can you replace that when you have a chance, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy middle of the Summer season!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2010 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Message from Duck Soup: Always, always, always make a reservation! They had to turn away some people last night who we had sent out there saying it was mid-week and they wouldn’t need reservations….bummer! Oh well, just something for us to keep in mind.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2010 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Please please please keep the safe locked at all times. We have lots of guests belongings in there :)\r\n\r\n    Speaking of which, I couldn’t find any safe deposit bags, so there are a guests belongings in the safe in a ziplock bag with their name on it. Please ask me if you have any questions about this.\r\n\r\n    Brynn or Lilly, the bag in the back needs to be sent off tomorrow. Their name and everything are in the bag, you will see it.\r\n\r\n    342 may stop by in the morning, possibly trying to switch into a earth place. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\n    See you all soon :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2010 at 6:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Well we are selling out quick for this week. I took the liberty of putting 303 (our last room) on hold for Wednesday and 215 on hold for Thursday. Friday and Saturday already have hold rooms.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 10:01 pm\r\n\r\n    A few FYI’s\r\n    115 needs a new remote. I brought new batteries to them and reprogrammed their old remote and it didn’t quite work. I got hit by the ferry rush at 9:30 and couln’t make it up there until it was clear. They called in to tell me they were just going to bed. They ask that we bring them a new remote in the morning. Khai-chan could you see to that?\r\n\r\n    There is a bag of jackets in the back office by the “storage room” door. That needs to be mailed off on Thursday or Friday. Use the CC info and address on file.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY\r\n    Please please please take the garbage out (wipe prints from garbage can), vacuum, dust, and straighten up the lobby every night. This is the first impression our guests have, when they come to visit us and we shall make it a clean one!\r\n    Thank you so much.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 9:43 am\r\n\r\n    Lilly or Brynn-\r\n    There are a couple of jackets on the back desk, they will need to be sent via post san juan on Thursday. They are for reservation #2181195.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2010 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    2011 RATES\r\n    We are starting to get 2011 inquiries. Our summer rates are not entered yet. The boss ladies will work on that after labor day. Until then, if somebody wants to make a reservation for 2011, take their name and number, we’ll match 2010 prices for them, I will call them and make a reservation for them.\r\n\r\n    What a gorgeous day today, island freshly washed, perfect weather, good air, nice!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2010 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    FUN WITH ATM’s\r\n    One of the guest in 203 had her ATM card “eaten” by the Wells Fargo ATM. It took her card, gave her a “Out of Service” sign, and then shut down. Steffi left messages with as many of the WF employees as we could track down. We are trying to see if the bank manager can open the machine up to free the card. There is a small stack of papers next to the fax/copier with phone numbers to the WF employees we found. Keep an ear out if the bank manager calls us. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2010 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All..\r\n    New item: When you open the pool patio doors please make sure the pad lock is on the front wood gate. There is no exceptions to this, it must be locked as long as the pool doors are open, once they are closed you may unlock the pad lock. Remember no one else may have the key to unlock it, only the front desk staff.. Ask Khai or Steffi where it is kept now.\r\n    If you walk by the pool and the side door is propped open and no one is around, please close the door and let Steffi or I know..\r\n    Any questions give us a call..\r\n    Have a good weekend, and remember you are all a bunch of ROCK STARS..\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    The bag on the back desk is for a guest that will be checking in tomorrow (the name is on a tag on the bag) please make sure she receives it when she checks in!\r\n\r\n    Also on the back desk, one of our irons has a short in it…guest said it would turn on then off repeatedly..should we get rid of it or can it be fixed?\r\n\r\n    We need more trash bags at the front desk…we only have the little ones! Also we need to get some more tea..we are running out..do we have any in the orca room?\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Anyone know where the pool patio pad lock is?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    OOPS one more thing, please do not edit or add anything other then what is on the Earthbox Groove on Pandora..\r\n    Thanks…\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    The guest checking in tomorrow (confirm.#-2453048), first name Katie, has a bag in the backroom on the desk. Please remove the tag w/guest name on it and give to her. Thank you, Kathy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Our favorite maintenance man broke his wrist :(\r\n    He is going to be left handed for a while.. Regino will be helping out with maintenance for a little while..\r\n\r\n    Guest survey’s~I just sent off a stack of survey’s back to the SJIVB, Yah.. thank you for getting those out to the guests. Don’t forget to keep passing them out…The information is important..\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2010 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of things-\r\n\r\n    First, the Mary Kay makeup bag on the back desk needs to be taken to post san juan tomorrow. I tried to take it today but they needed a credit card to pay for packaging (box) and then they will charge the shipping costs to the fedex account written on the Post SJ slip. Please call him tomorrow and let him know that his credit card will be charged for the packing costs.\r\n\r\n    Also, a guest named Leora Peterson left something plugged in underneath the bar in her room. Could you please have Raquel check for it and then call Leora.\r\n\r\n    Thanks guys, see you soon\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    324\r\n    is blocked out because it has no fridge. We moved their fridge into 335 because 335’s fridge smelled like sour milk. 335’s fridge is in the cedar room to air out. Please let Raquel know and make sure the fridge in 324 gets replaced before tomorrow’s check-in.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    We have a lost& found request over a week old (i-pod arm wrist and charger). Guest called back to ask again. The sheet keeps getting moved from the back desk to my office without anybody writing on it if the item has been found, if the guest has been contacted.\r\n    Can you please ask Raquel tomorrow if the item has been found. Then please call the guest with the answer. Then write on the sheet what all happened.\r\n    Thank you so much!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone…..Just a quick reminder for AM shift–please try to get the “check outs” done before you leave. PM shift gets busy with “check-ins” and miscellaneous room requests, reservations, etc. especially when we have a full house. Thank you!! :-)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Cindy.. you’re on vacation. No blogging allowed.\r\n\r\n    I watered the orchid :) It will probably need more water in a week\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    110\r\n    Checked some folks into 110 and it wasn’t clean. PLEASE make sure you tell Raquel this time!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone! Just let you know that Victoria Clipper reservations are exempt from the “two night” minimum for Saturday stays. So if the Victoria Clipper calls to make a reservation for a Saturday night go a head and let them. Thank you!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 2:00 am\r\n\r\n    Refilled the jacuzzi last night. I didn’t put the sign up. Water will be fine chemically but a bit colder than it should be. Feel free to put it up if people complain. It’s just inside the chem room door.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2010 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    by Morgan’s door have a fallen off chain. Please bring to bike shop in the morning.\r\n\r\n    110\r\n    moved guest because of noise. Please let Raquel know that room needs to be cleaned\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 4:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Island Dazzle….\r\n\r\n    I’m just so dazzled by this special, I decided to extend it through August 26th.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 12:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Fritz will be coming to pick up 2 or 4 more standard size pillows, and returning 2 king pillows, Raquel has them in the back so call her if I am not here.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 12:32 pm\r\n\r\n    REMINDER\r\n    Please remember to tell housekeeping if a guest extends their stay or leaves a day early. If it happens after you print the housekeeping report they won’t have any knowledge of the change. So please. Keep them in the loop. It makes Raquel and Regino happier.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 5:35 pm\r\n\r\n    2 NIGHT MINIMUM\r\n    I had some guests call and ask if we could make an exception to the 2 night minimum stay on Saturdays through the summer. We can’t. But I said if they call the Friday before the Saturday they would like to come and we still have many unsold rooms we would consider a one night stay on a Saturday. Make sense?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 11:37 am\r\n\r\n    Happy blogging :)\r\n    Sometimes we have envelopes for people to stop by and pick up at the front desk. I am going to start putting them in the voucher file under the front desk, under the person’s last name. This way we don’t have a bunch of stuff on the back desk. There are two in there right now that had been sitting on the back desk since the beginning of last week.\r\n    :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 2:31 am\r\n\r\n    Some maintenance stuff that needs to be addressed tomorrow:\r\n    343 – Complained late at night that their AC isn’t working. Said that they had it on “Cool” and it hadn’t turned on for several hours. I went over some possible fixes with them over the phone and I hadn’t heard back. Seth might want to take a look just to make sure it’s nothing other than the usual.\r\n\r\n    102 – Tub faucet fell off. The retaining ring that tightens to hold it on to the pipe snapped. I couldn’t find a replacement so I had to move the lady in there. Please have Seth take a look at it. I think all it needs is a quick replacement.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2010 at 4:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Halli hallo!\r\n\r\n    $50 OFF PROMOTION\r\n    Please make sure to give them to all our guests, together with the SJIVB surveys.\r\n    Please know the $50 off promotion is only good for rack rates, may not be combined with any other special. Read the fine print on the back.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please double check the Clipper allocation release forms in the basket on the back desk. You can double check all but the ones you entered.\r\n\r\n    CASH $$$$$$$$$\r\n    Please count the till every night and drop cash income into the safe.\r\n\r\n    Happy sunny day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2010 at 3:32 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m on a blogging streak….\r\n    The new, gorgeous orchid in the lobby needs to be watered once a week at most. It was just watered on Friday, so next Friday it could probably use some water. I think we should blog when we water it. Orchids are picky :)\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2010 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a post san juan slip made out for samantha wood on the back desk. she will be receiving a package soon address to her name, please forward the package through post san juan using the pre made slip. thank you!\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2010 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n    Just a reminder to ask how the guests want the bed in the Wind Place, and write it in the housekeeping requests and in the remarks. Thanks!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2010 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    *EMAIL*\r\n\r\n    We didn’t receive any email today until around 7:30pm, and many guests say they haven’t received the confirmation emails we’re sending out. I think there may be a serious glitch in our email.\r\n\r\n    BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS OK!!! :) We’re sold out tonight. Yahoo!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2010 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Please make sure room 218 gets a fan tomorrow, they are staying for three nights and didn’t have a fan in their room for some reason but would like one for their next two nights, thanks!!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2010 at 5:16 pm\r\n\r\n    #2429483 left a pair of shoes and an i-phone charger in their room. Can someone please call housekeeping in the morning and find out if they have any of these items and then call the guest and let them know. Thanks!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2010 at 11:31 am\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    HI folks. Just a reminder that when you are making clipper reservation (by either phone or fax) to make sure you attach them to the Victoria Clipper corporate account. That way they will show up when Cindy does the billing. Also, when you book the rooms for them via fax. Make sure you write our reservation number next to the guest name on the fax you are sending back to the Clipper. That way they will stop calling us to get the number. Thank you! :D\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2010 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    Hello :)\r\n    I wanted to let you all know that we just ordered a new coin operated washer for the guest laundry….No more coin eating machines..\r\n    I also ordered some IPOD clock radio’s for BR, so if you see that come in, let Raquel know so she can bring them down there.\r\n    Please be really careful when setting a wake up call.. We want to make sure all our guests get up when needed, also recommend to them to use the clock radio’s as a back up..\r\n    I have a call into Bob, for him to come and finish the phone console…Let me know if you see him if I am not here..\r\n    Remember~ASK your guests to comment on TRIPADVISOR.COM…..we want to hear from them.. That is how we can continue to improve..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2010 at 8:00 pm\r\n\r\n    206 – HAIRDRYER\r\n    keeps blowing the hair dryer fuse. Guest requested a new hair dryer for Tuesday. Please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK PRINTER\r\n    is not working, something something cartridge….\r\n\r\n    A/C UNITS BUILDING D\r\n    We had all our A/C units serviced. They are all in working order. However, those are older units and they won’t make the room icy cold on hot days. They will maybe take the temperature down 15 degrees, but not much more. And they shut off when they reach the point where they would freeze up otherwise. Just explain to our guests to turn on the fan after the units shut off. They will turn on again after they are ready.\r\n    And if somebody rents a room solely for the A/C, please let them know, the room won’t be like a walk-in cooler.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2010 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    I organized the shelves in the back office this morning. I put all the manuals in the middle file cabinets in the back if anyone needs them.\r\n\r\n    I got some more of the backdoor menus in the rooms. There are only a few left :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2010 at 12:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody– Sunday 8/1…Would anyone be willing to switch a shift with me? I am trying to go offisland with my Dad but he only has weekends off :( I could switch with any of you and work your Monday or Tuesday. Please let me know asap! Thank you :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2010 at 6:27 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Please make a few every shift.\r\n\r\n    PET POLICIES\r\n    We need them as well. If we run out, please print some more.\r\n\r\n    MENUS\r\n    There are still rooms which have the old Back Door Kitchen menu in their guest directory. Let’s try to get them in in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\n    With it being summer, me working at both properties and all of us being so busy I need you guys to be my eyes and ears. If we run low on something, fill it or blog that it needs filling. If I ask you to do something, do it or blog that you didn’t get to it. Pretty please?\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS\r\n    Please read emails and our website for new specials.\r\n\r\n    Gorgeous day, happy guests, fairs and plays and whales and things, it’s summer!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    Oh one more thing there are “GUEST SURVEY’S” at the front desk… EVERY GUEST needs one at check in, and please ask them to return them before check out….It is for the Visitor’s Bureau to gathering some information on our guests that visit the San Juan’s.. When the guest return them, please put them in my box..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 11:10 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday~\r\n    Please don’t give anyone Seth’s cellphone when they call. I just had a rude experience with some sales call.. We may take messages for Seth but don’t pass sales call off to him or non sales calls.. Messages please.\r\n    AC~there is nothing wrong with the AC’S Seth has cleaned them and checked them.. If they click off have the guest turn the knob more towards the cool.. Seth will call to ask WM some questions today and I will keep you updated if there is anything else we need to do.\r\n    The washer in the guest laundry has a new cord on it. Seth is doing a load right now to make sure it is all cool to go..\r\n    Sophie will be here this weekend..:)\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone! I was working Weds evening and Webrezpro went down for quite a while and I was unable to retrieve any information regarding check-ins and room availability. Not fun….Morgan came down and helped me out….Thank you!!!\r\n\r\n    So Cindy has asked that the morning shift print a “check in” list every day. That should keep us out of trouble if we lose power or the reservation system goes down again.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 10:08 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    We call West Mechanical if something is wrong with the guest washers and Seth can’t fix it. Khai, can you have Seth have a look at the washer and then call West Mechanical, please (number on phone list)?\r\n\r\n    338\r\n    Khai, can you make sure Seth looks at the air conditioning in room 338. It wasn’t working for the last 2 days (had to refund) and we have a guest checking in especially for the AC tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Thank you. Have a great shift everybody.\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    The first washing machine knob has broken off and there is no way to start it….who do we call to fix it?\r\n    Valerie Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello=)\r\n    Steffi, i changed summer menu in 6 rooms for today!\r\n    I continue in next time!!\r\n    ohhhh…motel is really busy!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    MARKET CODE CHANGES:\r\n\r\n    Important changes guys. And when I say important, I mean it! This is super critical stuff for us to be able to track how people hear about us so that we can know where we need to advertise.\r\n\r\n    I have changed the market codes so that there are only 12 codes now. Please STUDY THEM CAREFULLY. If you have any questions ASK, ASK, ASK. I would much rather that you ask me about this stuff than just fill something in that is not correct.\r\n\r\n    When you study this list, you will see two NEW entries. One is X-direct online booking. Do not use this code…ever. This is automatically entered when people book directly online.\r\n\r\n    The other new booking is the $50 Super Cool one. This is used for the new CUSTOMER RETENTION CARDS which you should give to each guest that checks in. READ this card and see all of the information. This card is to be used on any future booking, but it cannot be used in combination with any other special.\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS? ASK!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Please remember to keep the bikes locked throughout the day..\r\n    AND\r\n    Don’t forget about the cute little red MOPED, it needs to come out of the pool patio ever morning..\r\n    Please don’t leave the broken bikes sitting for more than 12 hours, if there is something that needs attention on them, make sure to have Seth or Morgan look to see if they can fix them and if not, or if they are not on schedule, ship them over to Island Bicycles..\r\n    Front Desk Staff\r\n    When you have a few moments can you keep your eyes out for garbage that is left out by the garden and entry area to the office. It will just take a few moments to walk up and do a quick pick up..\r\n    Enjoy…..You are all AWESOME….\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2010 at 5:24 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHING MACHINES\r\n    It looks like the “newer” washing machine that was just fixed is starting to act up again. It is making some very loud “thunking” noises while operating. I know Seth called Geiser and Sons to look at the “older” machine. Perhaps they can look at the other one as well.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2010 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    NO PERSONAL COMPUTER USE!\r\n\r\n    Hi guys, I hope you’re all having a great summer. You are working so hard and I really appreciate it. Our computers are also working hard, and as you know, they are sometimes “freezing up”.\r\n\r\n    It has become clear that several of you are using the computers for personal use. I need to reiterate that this is absolutely NOT okay. When you use these computers for personal use, you are opening up our ENTIRE system to viruses. This costs us lots of money and can wreak havoc.\r\n\r\n    Please do NOT use the computers for personal use and do NOT erase the “history” in Firefox or Explorer. We absolutely need to see what websites have been visited so that we can track down where these viruses are coming from.\r\n\r\n    So, in summary, PLEASE treat these computers with the utmost respect and TLC. If you need to use a computer for any personal reasons, use the lobby computer (or the upstairs one at Bird Rock) during your breaks.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    Laura\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 5:13 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ\r\n    We are having some issues with UNIREZ. For now, in case you get 2 reservations with the same name, please call the travel agent and confirm that the guest really meant to make 2 reservations.\r\n\r\n    AIR CONDITIONER 334\r\n    There is nothing wrong with it. Please let our guests know that the thermostat (the big knob going from red to blue) needs to be turned all the way to blue, otherwise the air conditioner thinks you want it warm. Also, on really hot days, the thingy shuts off every once in a while and kicks back on 10 minutes later. It’s just taking a little break so it doesn’t burn out. Like us:)\r\n\r\n    PHONE CONSOLE\r\n    Our phone console is feeling ill. She don’t work correctly right now. Centurytel is working on it. Right now our guests can’t check messages and we can’t either. So don’t leave messages in guest rooms and tell our guests patiently, if their message light is blinking, we can’t clear those old message right now.\r\n    Cindy, all the other issues are still going on. Please let the guy know.\r\n\r\n    Happy week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY MENUS\r\n    Hey Khai, Brynn & Lilly. On Wednesday will you goddesses please finish to put the summer Back Door Kitchen menus into the rooms? They are in Valerie’s box, together with a map of the rooms which are done already. Thank you!\r\n    Valerie Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone=)\r\n    Steffi, i changed menu for today just in 3 rooms, because other rooms are occupied!! and we need continue this!\r\n    Wow…This is my first post!!!)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2010 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDDING BAND\r\n    Our guest in 340 lost his plain gold wedding band. he doesn’t know where. If somebody turns it in, please call him.\r\n\r\n    341\r\n    Our guests in 341 may need help with their luggage upon check out on Wednesday. They are super nice and fit, but have bad backs.\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    Please call the Clipper again on Monday. We need to get yesterday’s release on the books.\r\n\r\n    VALERIE\r\n    Please continue putting the Summer 2010 Back Door Kitchen menus in the rooms you couldn’t get to today. I put them in your box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    326\r\n    Is our hold room for Monday. We are sold out Monday and Tuesday, yeah!!!!!\r\n\r\n    We got a nice review on Trip Advisor from one of the wedding guests a couple of weeks ago. Thank you all for your hard work. You rock!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2010 at 12:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of reminders:\r\n    First off, market chef is now open on Saturdays :)\r\n    Secondly, we need to all make sure that we leave confirmation numbers when we leave messages on the spa’s answering machine, so that we can locate the reservation that needs the treatments\r\n\r\n    I never received a clipper release report yesterday. I called them yesterday and today and left messages with the “person in charge” and am yet to hear back from them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    ASSISTANCE NEEDED\r\n    Khai, just a warning that the lady in 102 might need assistance getting from her room to the spa. She is in a wheelchair and she thinks she is going to need at least two people to get her down the hill. Her appointment is at 10:30 and she will call you in the morning if she needs help.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2010 at 2:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Room 108–lost a pair of jeans in the washer or dryer. Morgan let her finish up some laundry in housekeeping a few nights ago because it was late and now she can’t find a pair of her jeans, Joe’s Brand. I called housekeeping but they didn’t find anything. Please let her know if anything turns up #2435237.\r\n\r\n    There is money in an envelope on the back desk for Captain Maya from some guests who went on a whale watch cruise with him yesterday but didn’t know he couldn’t accept credit cards, he should be picking it up later today.\r\n\r\n    Brynn went to the bank and got us 20’s, 10’s, 5’s, 1’s …we were all out!!\r\n\r\n    Please make sure someone goes to Post San Juan on Monday to put the i-touch charger i8n the mail on the back counter, they are closed today.\r\n\r\n    Very hectic day! The phone never stopped ringing!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2010 at 8:04 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone,\r\n\r\n    Several things…room 334 is blocked out, a/c is not working properly. Room 336 is also blocked out, the water doesn’t seem to be working properly, Seth knows and will be fixing it hopefully today.\r\n\r\n    The back computer has a virus!! Please leave it off until Chris Teren gets here to fix it.\r\n\r\n    It’s gonna be another scorcher today…bring on the sunshine and heat!! A littler reminder from Cindy that we should be reminding guests as they book reservations that we do not have a/c in all of our rooms, this way we can avoid surprising guests by the lack of a/c in their room when they arrive (but all the rooms do currently have fans in them!)\r\n\r\n    Enjoy the beautiful weather everyone :)\r\n    Brynn Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM 336\r\n    Shower/tub heads are very finicky, the guest and I both played around with it but it was very difficult to make it work, plus hot water wasn’t happening. I moved him to room 337.\r\n\r\n    ROOM 334\r\n    AC troubles. Apparently it won’t stay on or get cool enough. Moved guests to room 306.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 12:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh soooooo busy on my last day!!! Totally overwhelmed!\r\n\r\n    The van. It’s back and running. Hooray.\r\n\r\n    Morgan- thank you for opening the windows for me. The cross-ventilation helps!\r\n\r\n    We need more pet registration forms. I’m looking for the document on the computer but haven’t found it yet. Will keep looking.\r\n\r\n    So today begins my maternity leave. But if anyone is desperate to have a shift covered and I haven’t yet gone into labor, then I might be able to help you out. So call me.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 10:30 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Anyone know what is wrong with the 2 bikes over by Morgan’s? If so, please let Seth know.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 11:56 am\r\n\r\n    Thing that make you go hmmmmmm….\r\n\r\n    The key saga continues. No idea what is happening but keys are mysteriously not working. Seth said he would re-program the doors… but we both think the issue is with the key maker in the office. It reads that the keys are valid when they don’t actually work in the doors.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to say to the blogosphere that the washers are being finicky lately. Sometimes they work, sometimes they decide to eat a guest’s quarters. Not sure what this is all about.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 8:27 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys (Angela & Halley)…\r\n    Johnny is wondering if either of you took a message yesterday from a large group inquiring about the hours of the juice bar. (It wasn’t me and it wasn’t Morgan.) If so, do you have contact information? I couldn’t find a message anywhere.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2010 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hmmmm…..I think we’ve entered the Bermuda Triangle of keycards. Rm 314 is having major door lock issues and Seth is being wonderful and taking care of it. Also, the Wind Place keys weren’t working. I made 3 different sets and none worked. Then magically, they worked again. Just a ‘heads up’ for the next shift. :-)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    YOU DON’T HAVE MAIL\r\n    We seem to be having email difficulties again. I went all shift without receiving an email. I processed at least 10 online bookings and guests tried sending us stuff a couple times so I know we should be receiving. I tried restarting Outlook and the back computer to no effect. Be prepared for a possibly very full inbox in the morning.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Lovelies!\r\n    Miss Laura is also off to an adventure, so if you have any issues, call me at home.\r\n    Have a great week. Check out our new special Island Dazzle, uuhhhh!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 5:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi ALL~\r\n    Stephanie and Halley when you are working on Tuesday, can you please remove all the decorations? The outside ones as well. You can ask Raquel where she would like you to store them, not in the back luggage room though :) More than likely in the Cedar room..\r\n    Island Paper is coming tomorrow, and they are going to pick up 4 coffee makers we purchased from them for return, those coffee makers are in the Orca Storage, Raquel knows where they are.\r\n    I found a few reservations for the future that had not been charged the 10%, don’t forget to process that deposit, it helps you to know ahead of time if the credit card number is valid..\r\n    Stephanie, thank you for your thoughtfulness when you made your cupcakes for the 4th, you are so sweet.\r\n    The van is currently at the Lube Guy, Morgan knows the details..\r\n    There is a check on my desk for Raquel, she is picking up some shampoo for Bird Rock on Wednesday, can you make sure she gets the check Stephanie..\r\n    Speaking of Raquel, did you know she has a birthday on Friday.. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS RAQUEL… We love you..\r\n    I am going on a college adventure…. You can reach me on my cell.. or my email…..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 12:35 pm\r\n\r\n    PEPSI\r\n    left msg with Pepsi rep to please come and fix his machine.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2010 at 1:25 pm\r\n\r\n    PEPSI MACHINE IN BUILDING A\r\n    is out of order. We put a little sign up. I tried to call the Pepsi folks, no answer. Will try again tomorrow.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2010 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th everyone~Enjoy your weekend..\r\n\r\n    When you do a POS charge make sure that you only use the category Gift Shop Misc, for Gift shop items..\r\n    This will make it much easier for me when I am seeing how well our gift shop is doing..\r\n\r\n    See you at the parade..\r\n\r\n    :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2010 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy July 1st to all you fabulous people.\r\n\r\n    This is just a little love note to tell you how amazing each and every one of you are and how much I appreciate everything you do every single day. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there this weekend!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2010 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    So you know Western Prince’s orange zippy little zodiac boat? It’s called the “Western Explorer”… Anyway, did you know that the prices are different? Well, they are. They charge $99 for adults and $76 for children under 12.\r\n\r\n    Also, all passengers on the Western Explorer wear full “exposure protection suits” over their clothes. So if you book a guest on the Explorer, advise them not to wear anything too bulky. Light layers are recommended. A sweatshirt or light fleece would be appropriate. They also recommend close-toed shoes like sneakers. As Chris from WP said, “It’s a full experience!”\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2010 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    4TH OF JULY availability-\r\n    FYI…In case we need to refer anyone elsewhere for the night of the 4th, as of 2:42 on Tuesday Juniper Lane Guest House has her cabin available for the night of the 4th only. It is a little house w/ full kitchen and balcony that sleeps 4 comfortably. Rate is $199. Juniper’s number is: 378-7761\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2010 at 12:25 pm\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN\r\n    is hosting a ladies-only half marathon (13.1 miles) on October 17th, 2010… and we are offering a discount rate that weekend for anyone staying with us for the run. If they mention run ladies run, the rate is $99.\r\n\r\n    BooBoo dropped off flyers with info about the run- they’re under the wipe board by the swing gates. The backside of the flyers have a training log. Pretty handy for anyone wanting to train for this. Who’s in?!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 5:43 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW NEW NEW\r\n    There is a new company out of Roche that is offering private boat charters on a classic wooden motoryacht. They are called Choice Charters. They do not have a price sheet because they offer flexible trips that are catered to the guest’s specifications. They do say that they will be comparable to the average whale watching prices/trip times just to give you an idea. They can also do hors d’oeuvre catering and even an on-board seafood dinner. Everything is flexible. Brochures are over by the swing-gates.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 3:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Seth picked up the map paper today from Printonyx. Yay. Thanks, Seth!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Maloulas Restaurant\r\n    is now open all week except of Wednesday. Oh yummy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2010 at 6:01 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered map paper from Printonyx about 2 weeks ago. We are now completely out. I printed out some to use but we need to call Printonyx Monday morning to see if they have it completed yet. If so, we need to go get it. If not, we should see if they can print us off enough to get us by.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2010 at 12:56 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered coffee from SJ coffee today…it should be delivered tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2010 at 3:00 pm\r\n\r\n    TESLA ELECTRIC SUPER CAR\r\n    This is exciting: on Saturday, July 3, the Tesla Motors company will come to Friday Harbor to introduce their new electric super car. What makes it super is the fact that you can drive it on the highway.\r\n    So from 10AM to 4PM people (guests, us, islanders) can sign up to take the thingy for a spin. Our property will be the staging area. I will get some more info on this soon. They are staying here with us.\r\n    Yeah for finding ways to get us less oil dependent!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    PRINTER TONER\r\n    Our front desk printer is low on toner. I put a replacement cartridge on my desk, so when the time comes, we don’t have to take the entire luggage room apart:)\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please make sure to release the blocked out Clipper rooms when you input the reservations from the allocation.\r\n    Go to: Unit Closeouts, click on respective date, unclick arrows, save. The 4 closed out earth places per day are the clipper block.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation #2328908 thought they left a book and book mark in their room, I went back and checked and housekeeping checked, there was no book/bookmark in the room. The guests will be coming back by here in a few days to check and see if we found it, please let them know we did not.. :(\r\n    I feel summer…..\r\n    Enjoy..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 2:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    From now on Raquel or Regino are going to give us a call everyday around 1:00pm so that we have an update on which rooms are clean for that one-something ferry arrival.\r\n    Yay :)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2010 at 8:13 am\r\n\r\n    Hey front deskers (that doesn’t sound right)…\r\n    Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that last week I went kayaking with Crystal Seas as they invited me to go… and promised I would fit in the kayak. (And I did!) It was a blast.\r\n\r\n    I highly encourage you to take the opportunity to go out with a kayak tour to experience first hand what it is like. You might already be well aware that most of the companies will extend an invitation to us Earthboxers (that also does not sound right) and a guest to go for free as long as they have room. Go now before the season gets too busy! It’s so much easier to talk to guests about the kayak tours if we’ve experienced it ourselves.\r\n\r\n    If you want to read more about my experience and see pics, you can check out my blog post about it. (of course I blogged about it!) Right here: http://twoyearsonanisland.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/paddling-and-pregnant-at-35-weeks/\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 9:10 pm\r\n\r\n    With warmer weather coming, just wondering: Are we getting fans for the rooms with no AC? Had a guest call and ask how to turn on the air in Bldg A. “Room is stuffy.”\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 8:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest Laundry: The first washer continues to eat quarters and NOT produce service. Morgan was able to get it working earlier, but another guest lost his coins. :-( Left work order for Seth.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 1:34 pm\r\n\r\n    The pillow question has been answered and the pillows have been picked up. Bye, bye pillows!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 11:18 am\r\n\r\n    A guest ordered pillows from us and was wondering if they had come in. Does anyone know if they have?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2010 at 4:37 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER UPDATE\r\n    Soooooooo, Cindy and I conferred and decided the nightly booking report has too many ways for us to mess up, especially if they won’t even cancel previously made reservations.\r\n    As of today: we will disregard the nightly booking report. We will use the Allocation Release only to make our Clipper bookings. This means we need to pay extra super attention to the Allocation Release, but if we do (and we will!) everything should be fine.\r\n    BUT: please continue to look for Clipper reservations by name before you make new ones, because we may have them on the books already from previous nightly booking reports.\r\n    ALSO: continue to look at the nightly booking reports for cancellations.\r\n\r\n    Again, please ask Morgan or I if you have any questions. Thanks for staying tuned.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2010 at 4:30 pm\r\n\r\n    iPod Docks\r\n    Well it seems like we have some new iPod docks set up in Building D and E. If people need adapters for different models of ipod they are in a bag, in the drawer in the back desk above the pet registration forms.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2010 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER PART XXXCCVCCIIIIIIII\r\n    Hokay. Just when we thought we got it all figured out, a new curve ball: if somebody cancels a Clipper booking within 6 days of the booking, Clipper doesn’t send us a cancellation on the nightly booking report, they just send the allocation release WITHOUT the canceled name on it. Great. So:\r\n    When you process your allocation report, release blocked out rooms, double check Clipper reservations already made, fax it back to them and then:\r\n    Please go to that day’s check ins and make sure there isn’t a Clipper reservation on our books, which didn’t show up on the allocation report. If there is, double check everything, and I mean everything, then cancel it.\r\n    Ask Morgan or I if you have any questions. Pay good attention to processing the Clipper reports, this is really important and can bite us hard if we mess up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2010 at 4:34 pm\r\n\r\n    334\r\n    Had dripping sound all night long and moved rooms. Please let Raquel know that room needs to be cleaned on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE ROOM\r\n    What’s up with the food and shrimp basket in the luggage room, anybody know? Also: big box of pillows with my name on it, I don’t know what that is and why they are there, why, I ask, why why why?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2010 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE ROOM\r\n    Morgan, Valerie, let’s organize the luggage room in the next few days. Put boxes on higher shelf, etc. It’s a date?\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2010 at 10:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Had quite a few compliments on our establishment this evening. A couple of folks came from Best Western and wanted to look at a room here for future visits. They were “blown away” by the grounds and loved the feeling here. Will definitely stay with us next time. Also, have a number of guests who came in to tell me specifically how much they enjoy staying at Earthbox. Yay!!!! Pretty sure we’ll get a few TripAdvisors….I gave them the website information. Oh, and one guest wanted me to tell Management that the website is ‘fabulous’!! Go us!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a heads up: A guest called requesting a fan while I had a bunch of folks in the lobby. It took a while for everyone to leave so I could shut down and go take one to him. Now, I swear the guest told me he was in 205 but when I showed up there, no one knew anything about needing a fan. So if the guest who actually needed the fan calls please offer my apologies for not getting it to him.\r\n\r\n    We really need to start getting fans into all the rooms for the season.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Ordered map paper.\r\n    stephanie Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 11:41 am\r\n\r\n    Aaaaaaaahhhh! Two Clipper groups checked in at the same time after arriving on the 10:35 ferry. Along with regular guests. Very hectic. I tried to make it as smooth as possible… but didn’t have much notice. They arrived earlier due to the Clipper breaking down. Hopefully they are happy :-)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2010 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER BROKE DOWN\r\n    All guests scheduled to go back to Seattle on the Clipper today, Sunday 6/13, are advised to check in at the Clipper booth at the Harbor between 3:45 and 4:00 where they will receive instructions about how to take the Washington State Ferry and a shuttle back to Seattle.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    EMERGENCY HOLD ROOMS\r\n    I blocked our 2 Earth Places every Friday and Saturday night through Labor day.\r\n    On Friday mornings:\r\n    if we aren’t sold out, release the 2 rooms for Friday only\r\n    On Saturday morning:\r\n    if we aren’t sold out release the 2 rooms for Saturday\r\n\r\n    If we are close to sold out, release one room per day.\r\n\r\n    If we are sold out release one room mid day (around 4PM), keep the second one until most of our check-ins are here, (around 7 or 8PM). If things look good around 6 and you get folks asking if we have availability, you may say, that you have an emergency room you will release around 7 or 8 and ask the guest to call back (or take down her number and call her).\r\n\r\n    Please ask Cindy, Morgan or I if you aren’t sure how to properly release blocked out rooms.\r\n\r\n    Rock’n Roll, Summer here we are!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Mistakes where made…..Please pay extra special super mega very intense attention to the daily booking report and the release allocation report. Especially to:\r\n\r\n    how many nights:\r\n    that was our problem tonight, sold out, but had a Clipper staying 2 nights not 1\r\n\r\n    guests currently enjoying your establishment:\r\n    those are multiple night stays and do not require a new reservation for today’s date\r\n\r\n    status: new or canceled\r\n\r\n    Steph, Morgan, Lilly and I went over this. Steph will triple quadruple check upcoming Clipper reservations on Monday.\r\n    After that no more excuses. If we are over booked and the paper has your initials, you will take the guests home and cook them a nice dinner:)\r\n    Onward!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 10:09 am\r\n\r\n    DOWN BEDDING ALLERGY…\r\n    Just found out from Raquel that our bedding in SKY PLACE rooms has down in it. A couple of guests checked in early today but needed hypo-allergenic bedding and I didn’t know to check with Raquel on that first. She said that any time we have guests with a down allergy, she needs to change all the bedding to accommodate them so to check with her first.\r\n\r\n    So- while the guests waited, Raquel (like a rockstar) changed the bedding for them.\r\n\r\n    We should probably always put a note in the housekeeping line when the guest is allergic to down and check with Raquel/Regino first to make sure that the room is ready before checking anyone in. Sorry, Raquel!\r\n    Steph\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2010 at 3:12 pm\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Starting June 20th Western Prince has a new schedule for their tours.\r\n\r\n    The big boat (Western Prince II): 2PM daily + an added tour on Fridays, Saturdays & Sundays 10:30 AM.\r\n\r\n    The Zodiac (Western Explorer): 11 & 3 daily\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 9:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Spring Street School may need the conference room on Thursday afternoon if it rains for the 8th grade promotion. They will set up the conference room and clean it up (supposedly).\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 4:07 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI: The number for Bob’s Taxi needs to be changed to 378-6777 on our “important numbers” list. The old number goes to their office and not the driver.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 9:51 am\r\n\r\n    MOPED\r\n    Susie dropped off a moped yesterday. It’s by the bikes. Whoever works the closing shift will need to bring the moped into the pool area and lock it up. The opening shift person will then need to bring it out and set it up by the bikes in the morning.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The spa is now open at 9AM, FYI.\r\n\r\n    SLUG\r\n    There was a slug in the lobby this morning. A big one. Just saying hello. Probably looking for his little 6 1/2 year old friend who is a guest here and loves slugs.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2010 at 4:05 pm\r\n\r\n    IDEA: maybe we should check to be sure the new TV Guides are correct. :-)\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2010 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi: I put almost all of the TV Guides in the rooms. (and removed the old guide from every book while inserting the new one) But….there were a couple of rooms that I didn’t get to and I left a note on the stack of extra TV Guides. Sorry I only remember 110 was one of them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    TV GUIDES\r\n    Had another 2 rooms with the incorrect TV guide in the guest folder. Who put the TV guides in the rooms? Did you miss rooms? Any recollection on which rooms might not have the correct one?\r\n    Khai, Angela if you guys aren’t busy tomorrow, can you go into our open rooms and check that each guest directory has\r\n    - spa menu\r\n    - TV Guide (the one which starts with “02 CNN, 03 Headline News”, if there are 2 TV guide throw out the incorrect one)\r\n    - Back Door Kitchen menu\r\n    Then write on a property map which rooms are good and let the next shift know? Angela and Lilly, can you continue this the next day?\r\n    Thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    For those of you who had to endure me going on and on and on about my landlord and the construction at my house: the landlord o.k.ed my request for some $$ off the rent, yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER SOME MORE\r\n    Hokay. We need to read the nightly booking reports more closely(not the one we fax, but the one which shows reservations and cancellations made during the last 24 hours). We missed a cancellation this weekend. So: highlight the booking status on the nightly booking report. When making a Clipper reservation make sure it says: NEW, not CANCELED. Sounds so easy, but we all missed it.\r\n    Further: when making a booking for a future Clipper reservation, make sure you release one of the rooms blocked out for Clipper on that day.\r\n\r\n    Eyes wide open, brain on, big smile on your face, t’is the season. We all feel the stress. But we can do this. We have all the tools we need (and if you don’t, you’ll let me know, deal?), we have a killer crew this year. You are all loved and appreciated. Together we are strong.\r\n    Onward!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 10:36 am\r\n\r\n    WORK TIME:\r\n\r\n    Cindy and I aren’t getting enough of it (work time, that is)…\r\n\r\n    As of today, we are now officially the BACK OFFICE OGRES. From 12:30 to 2:30 every week day, Cindy and I will be closing our doors and silencing our phones. Please don’t knock on our doors unless the building is burning down. If any body comes asking for us, please let them know we are not available.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    BICICLETAS\r\n    Just a reminder to please make sure to lock up all the bikes so they don’t end up taking a joy ride by themselves.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 8:35 am\r\n\r\n    LAUNDRY-\r\n    I JUST saw Cindy’s note about the first shift person needing to open the laundry room and prop open the door. I had a guest first thing ask to get in and I called Raquel (but she wasn’t here yet. Oops.) I will add the laundry room door into my morning opening routine.\r\n\r\n    ONE PROBLEM THOUGH… Raquel said that a guest was able to access the laundry room and did laundry at 11 PM the other night. How do we make sure that doesn’t happen?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2010 at 2:20 pm\r\n\r\n    CHECKS\r\n    We don’t take personal checks as payment. Cash, credit cards and Traveler’s checks only.\r\n\r\n    BUSINESS ACCOUNTS\r\n    We have accounts at Island Bikes and ACE, no need to pay with cash.\r\n\r\n    INITIAL\r\n    Please initial paid out receipts and write why the paid out was made (if it isn’t obvious).\r\n\r\n    Yep, you guessed it, I’m reconciling money:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2010 at 12:24 pm\r\n\r\n    TO OUR MARATHON RUNNING GUESTS:\r\n    You are rockstars! When the rains were coming down this morning and the winds were howling, I would have made a b line to the hot tub, but not you guys. You ran. I’m proud of you.\r\n\r\n    TO MORGAN:\r\n    Thank you so much for the excellent food yesterday. The home made pickles were a real treat and my 6 foot burger, well, for once I finally got enough meat. Thank you.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2010 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    We still have a guy from the SJ Golf Classic who never showed up…he was supposed to check in yesterday but didn’t show up and we saw no sign of him today. His invoice is on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    The stack of invoices on the back desk is for the Abbott group that had 6 rooms…they split their bill 13 ways so we have their receipts that they requested. They’re checking out tomorrow so if they don’t ask for their receipts just recycle them.\r\n\r\n    Clipper no-show #2292103…hmmmm.\r\n\r\n    Pretty quiet night, lots of people taking bikes out! What a beautiful sunny day…we’ve been waiting for this!\r\n\r\n    We’ve got several late checkouts tomorrow 6/6 because of the marathon and half marathon.\r\n\r\n    Thanks again for the yummy food Morgan :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2010 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    AIRCONDITION\r\n    Our Earth Places do NOT have air condition, neither do our Sky Places. Our Water Places and Sun Places do have air condition. This info is also in the room descriptions in WRP or when a guest makes an online booking.\r\n\r\n    INVOICES BACK DESK\r\n    There are a ton of invoices on the back desk. Why?\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    When checking the allocation release forms (the ones you fax) please do a search for each guest name on the form and make sure a reservation hasn’t been made already. Gracias!\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Thank you so much for covering for me yesterday. I owe you a favor:)\r\n    They took my house apart and installed a heating system (started to install I should say). It took me all night to clean up after them and put our rooms back together, aaaahhhhh.\r\n\r\n    What a fabulicious day on the island, sun, whales, baby foxes, smiling guests, it’s summer!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2010 at 10:39 pm\r\n\r\n    The t-shirts are actually all put away. they look great, Lil!\r\n\r\n    324 is dirty, please make sure housekeeping gets in there\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Yay, Angela and I got a big chunk of the t-shirts folded and tagged. I will continue working on organizing and putting them out tomorrow when I am here. Other than that, a pretty slow night. Finally we had a sunny day though!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Each front desk employee gets (2) blue shirts up here at the Earthbox. Please let me know when you pick up your (2)..\r\n    Also, if you are the opening shift of the day, please take your all access card and open the guest laundry and prop open the door..:)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 11:34 am\r\n\r\n    SUMMER ATTIRE\r\n    The new bright blue EarthBox t-shirts are in and they’re very cheery. Be sure to get yours on your next shift as the blue t-shirts are replacing the black for our front desk summer attire.\r\n\r\n    My ‘bun in the oven’ is much more obvious in the new blue shirts than the black ones. (Just thought you’d like to know.) Putting the blue shirt on made me feel instantly more summery. Okay, I’ll stop now. Got some shirts to tag and fold.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    WOW, I am so happy we can blog again, it feels like we are all connected. :) The sun is SO beautiful this morning, I even opened my sun roof..\r\n    What a weekend we have coming up, Celebrity Golf Classic, SJ Marathon, and many more fun things to do…\r\n    Enjoy…..\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 7:56 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    The sun is shining. Hallelujah!\r\n\r\n    LOBBY CLEANLINESS\r\n    This morning I had to clean chewing gum off of the desk next to the guest computer. Gross. Who does that?! Anyway… the lobby was, well, not spic and span overall. I think the rain storm yesterday left it’s mark… it needed a good vacuuming. Done and done.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    We had a guest calling earlier, very upset that they couldn’t find NBC on the TV and were missing the hockey game. I tried to help them out but couldn’t find an accurate channel guide, (the one’s in the back are incorrect) and she didn’t have one in the room either…do we have them anywhere or should new channel guides be made?\r\n\r\n    Not a very busy night, everyone is scared away from this place because of the rain!! Hopefully our summer weather will be here asap :)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    SPA RATES\r\n    Hey guys, just discovered an error where someone charged a guest only $85 for a prenatal massage… actual price is $95. Please double check massage treatment prices when processing vouchers for guests. Thanks! (this is a reminder for me too!)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 10:49 am\r\n\r\n    No Kayaking Today.\r\n    Icky weather… winds on the water have canceled all kayak trips today. Bummer for the guests who were here specifically to kayak. Word is they’ll be going out tomorrow as the weather looks to be better.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2010 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL TOWELS\r\n    Hi folks, as you are not doubt aware we are painfully low on pool towels. If we are out in the pool house, take them off the shelves in housekeeping. If there are no more in housekeeping, you can take them off the shelves in the building A housekeeping closets. Try to avoid taking them off the carts. Thank you!\r\n    Brynn Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2010 at 1:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Raquel has blocked out room 330 for at least today because of a bad smell. Hmmm.\r\n\r\n    It’s been a fairly calm day for Lilly and I so far…and it looks like we have a slight break from rain. Let’s hope!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2010 at 6:29 pm\r\n\r\n    WT…….????????\r\n    Today 2 ferries broke down. The morning sailing and the 4 something sailing was canceled. Seriously? This weekend?\r\n\r\n    So fare so good. Had one reservation call in frustration to ask to get out of their booking since they have to spend their vacation in the Anacortes ferry terminal and sold their room 10 minutes later.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The Spa called and asked for ways we could insure we have the correct massage reservations for the correct dates on the books. We had some glitches. So, when you make a massage reservation, make sure to repeat the time and date after each booking. Also note with whom you spoke at the spa. We might institute something like a call before each big weekend to double check our bookings. Ideas anybody?\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2010 at 10:05 am\r\n\r\n    Res. #1975425 canceled her room for this Sunday but apparently no one told her about the cancellation policy when she booked almost 6 months ago. Let’s try to resell her room…even though we aren’t sold out. She will call in the morning and if we couldn’t resell her room then she will just keep the room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2010 at 6:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    when switching shifts, please make sure you are not going into overtime (just yet). If it seems like there is no other way, please talk to Cindy and I first. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    AAA BATTERIES\r\n    We need some in a bad way. Please go to Ace tomorrow and get some for the weekend. Cindy, can you order us some bulk someplace?\r\n\r\n    215\r\n    Is the only room on the property which doesn’t have a remote control (there is none for that type of TV). Cindy ordered a replacement TV, should be here soon.\r\n\r\n    Happy Memorial Day weekend, everybody. Summer Season 2010 here we come!!!!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2010 at 6:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Western Prince is running a 4pm Whale Watch Tour on Sat and Sunday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2010 at 3:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All!\r\n    Just a reminder that we need to make sure everyone remembers to check the requests field when they are processing online reservations. I discovered a couple of reservations for this weekend that had requests for kayaking and/or whale watching trips. You need to make sure you take care of those or at the very least make an alarm so we are aware of it. Thank you all!!!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2010 at 9:09 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Daylight savings time! Set your clocks forward.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2010 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    I wonder if this will get deleted….\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2010 at 8:59 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub is refilled and heating. It will probably be fully ready to reopen late afternoon Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 4th, 2010 at 1:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Hally & Morgan!\r\n    Have a happy shift!\r\n    Got 2 jobs for you:\r\n    1) Please take the letter sized Back Door Kitchen menus and put them in all of our guest rooms. Place in the guest directories after the page explaining the room service. Thank you.\r\n    2) Please make spa vouchers.\r\n    Call me at Brrrr if you need anything. Miss you!\r\n\r\n    Also: our elevator is still out of order, but we have promises from the amazing elevator fixer that it will be repaired before April when our Exploritas groups start coming.\r\n\r\n    And: one of our guest will arrive around 2PM tomorrow and will need a ride from the ferry. Please call Regino for a pick up when the guest calls.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2010 at 12:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello, hello!\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY 3/2\r\n    Seth will work on the hot tub. It will be out of order for 3 days. Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Sasha from Back Door will drop off their menus soon. Please put in my box. I will place them in guest directories shortly and then it’s ON with the room service for the season, yeah!!! Do you all remember how to do this?\r\n    1) Guest will call Back Door to place order\r\n    2) Back Door will call us for pick up\r\n    3) We will pick up food, place on tray with silverware, plates, napkins (we don’t plate the food, just bring the to-go boxes on the tray)\r\n    4) Add food bill plus 15% to guest’s invoice\r\n    5) Bring food to guest’s room. Have guest sign invoice.\r\n    6) Charge guest’s cc or make change for cash and bring back to guest if applicable\r\n    7) Put food bill with guest confirmation # in Cindy’s box for payment\r\n    Ask me if you have questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2010 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    MONDAY – ECOLAB\r\n    Morgan, the stuff Ecolap sent is in the Cedar room.\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    Our elevator isn’t working. That was a bummer for our 100ppl event. They had to un-invite their handicapped guests. We got to make sure that we know these things beforehand.\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR\r\n    We got a great review. Check it out!\r\n\r\n    Oh it’s wonderful here tonight. Everybody is just beaming with the sun out like this. It’s like summer, busy, lot’s of kids and puppys(the dachshund beagle mix is my favorite). Thanks you, happy guests!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2010 at 12:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning sweet staff people!\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY\r\n    We have a group in the conference center. They will have a fund-raising dinner on Saturday, and will set up for it on Friday. They’ll arrive around 3 and will need table cloths. Raquel had all table cloths ironed and they are in the conference center already. It’s Raquel’s day off, so please call Regino with questions.\r\n\r\n    MONDAY\r\n    Eco-lab will be here first thing on Monday morning (7:40AM ferry) to install some equipment in the laundry rooms of both hotels. Morgan, will you be there at 8AM please, open the laundry room for them and drive some equipment to Bird Rock in our truck, please?\r\n\r\n    Also: I blocked out building E Monday and Tuesday. Seth will caulk the bath tubs. Just so you know.\r\n\r\n    WONDERFUL BOSS LADIES\r\n    Cindy will be back next Thursday. Laura will be back the week of March 1. Please let people know and ask if I can help them with anything. If you need me call me, no matter where you are, no matter how far, just call my name …… well, it probably works better if you call my phone.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2010 at 2:08 pm\r\n\r\n    THE CINDY PROJECT\r\n    Hey Morgan, Halley and Khai. Cindy left a project on my desk: labeling the 2010 file folders. I don’t know what the task is, but each of you does. Will you please work on this and get’er done before Cindy comes back? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 12th, 2010 at 7:48 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Made more spa vouchers. We were completely out. There are more to assemble. Have at it if you have time.\r\n\r\n    HOLE PUNCHER\r\n    Jan borrowed our 3 hole puncher over the weekend, just so you know.\r\n\r\n    DER HIMMEL UEBER BERLIN\r\n    I watched “Wings of Desire” by Wim Wenders last night again for the first time since it came out in 1987. It was the first movie filmed in the death stripe (the stripe between the West wall and the East wall). The East German government had never allowed that before. It really touched me, seeing the city before the wall came down, seeing Germany period. I guess I’m a little homesick. Anyway, if you are in an artsy tone poem mood, and want to check out what angels feel and long for, this is your movie.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, Seth, and Raquel for working so hard to get everything ready. Both properties look great. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    needs a tidy, please. Guests moved to different building.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 4:25 pm\r\n\r\n    F3\r\n    Please know that we don’t expect you to remember everything we blog about, you just have to know how to find it: press F3 to search the blog for keywords. Having said that:\r\n\r\n    We have new and exciting Spring specials (2/15 -3/31/10).\r\n\r\n    PEACE\r\n    Book a room at regular rate and we’ll donate $10 to Habitat for Humanity to build shelter for our fellow islanders in Haiti.\r\n    All you need to do is select that special if a guest wishes to. The boss ladies will tally and donate. IMPORTANT: do not select that special if you give a guest a discount.\r\n\r\n    LOVE\r\n    $20 off any Lavendera Day Spa treatment if you book a room at regular rate.\r\n    Book room, book spa treatment of guest’s choice as you would in any other case. IMPORTANT: Not good for already discounted rooms (like Earth special rate, etc.). Manually take $20 off spa charge, NOT room charge. We will pay spa their regular\r\n    rate.\r\n\r\n    HAPPINESS\r\n    Selected rooms (Earth, Sky, Water) for $99 plus tax per night. Can’t be combined with other specials.\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    LISTS LISTS LISTS\r\n    I updated the front desk daily check-list (in folder on back desk). Please fill one out every shift and put in my box.\r\n\r\n    POOL POOL POOL\r\n    One of the new things on the list is: turn off outside pool lights in chem room (chem room key in safe).\r\n    Also: Morgan, can you please fill the hot tub every morning and keep an eye out on how much water evaporates? And please turn off bathroom lights in pool every night.\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    If our spa fills up over this weekend, please refer guests to Spa de Bune. They will be open Sat and Su.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 10th, 2010 at 4:45 pm\r\n\r\n    LOVE LOVE LOVE\r\n    I’m in romance package heaven, yeah! When you get back to work, please go through all upcoming reservations and make sure I didn’t forget anything, please.\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    The spa has a fantastic special this weekend: EVERY treatment comes with rose pedal foot soak and chocolates, wow! Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    MORE CHOCOLATE\r\n    I picked up an extra box of chocolates from SJ coffee today in case we get a last minute request. It’s by the champagne.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    February 6th, 2010 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Steffi-\r\n    2066077 had some loud dogs. I couldn’t get a hold of them on any of their numbers. Left multiple messages. You might want to have housekeeping check for damage in their room. Also, I had to move 2010020 rooms because of the dogs barking and scratching at the door.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I got all the labels printed but I couldn’t find anymore folders. The labels that are left are on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, everything else was all good.\r\n    See you guys when I get back from Costa Rica!!\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 4th, 2010 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello, Hello!\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, for switcherooing the computer screens. And thank you for your Earthbox art on the chalk board. The leaves on the tree are little “e’s”, wow.\r\n    Can you please laminate our business licenses and put in Cindy’s box, please? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    SPARKLING LOBBY COUNTER\r\n    The lobby counter needs another day to set. Please have our guests sign their invoices on a folder or the coffee table. Don’t put things on the counter until Saturday or Seth will kick you in the chin.\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    Somebody will rent the conference center for next Wednesday tomorrow. I think for a cosmetics thingy. She will bring by a check. I quoted $50.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    If you are bored, please make vouchers and pet policy envelopes. Also go through the voucher folder and make sure we have current vouchers and voucher logs. I spoke to Brian from SJO. He will not raise prices this year, haven’t heard from the others yet.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Did you know that San Juan Coffee, which we serve in both of our hotel lobby’s is fair trade and organically grown by small family farms. They are so small that they can’t afford the organic certification, but it’s ethically, environmentally and taste bud wise excellent coffee.\r\n\r\n    VALENTINE’S\r\n    Is just around the corner. Remember last year when there was not a seat in any restaurant to be had? Let our guests know to make dinner reservations early. Here’s what’s open:\r\n    Vinnie’s – special menu\r\n    COHO – set menu, $35 per person\r\n    BLUFF – special menu\r\n    McMillan’s – regular menu + set menu for $45 per person\r\n    Downriggers – set menu\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend everybody. Let’s blog a lot, because we don’t see each other very often these days.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2010 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Sweeties!\r\n    Welcome back to work, kind of, well, yeah.\r\n\r\n    GUEST DIRECTORIES\r\n    Guess who has updated guest directories in each room? We do! Yeah! Check out the one on my desk, so you know what our guests see.\r\n\r\n    FEMA APPROVED\r\n    Guess who is FEMA approved for Federal Employees? We are! What does that mean? Federal employees, when traveling officially, must stay in FEMA approved facilities. So if a guest asks if we are, we are. Our FEMA number is on my pin-board.\r\n\r\n    BROCHURES\r\n    We got some cool new brochures, from the whale trail folks and a scuba diving map. Check them out.\r\n\r\n    LIL JOB FOR KHAI\r\n    Can you please copy and laminate our master licenses (on my desk) and put in Cindy’s box?\r\n\r\n    LIL BIGGER JOB FOR MORGAN\r\n    Can you please take the computer screen in the luggage room and install it on the Bird Rock front desk computer. Bring the one at Bird Rock back up here and connect it to our server. And take the server one and put it in the luggage room with a sticky note, saying: Chris T.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you. Call me at home if you have any questions or issues. Have fun, be kind and excellent!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2010 at 10:20 am\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    FYI: The Mullis Center puts out a discount book that offers discounts to island businesses. We are going to be included in there for 10% off. To get this discount, guests will need to provide the tear out sheet from the book.\r\n\r\n    p.s. The book has lots of great deals in it, you can buy one for $20, too!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2010 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    Testing.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 3rd, 2010 at 1:02 pm\r\n\r\n    GLITTER IS FOREVER\r\n    Thanks, Khai and Morgan for taking down all the decorations. Boy, that glitter sure is persistent, ain’t it?\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    Can you bring the toy on the back desk to Post San Juan tomorrow, please? There is a little boy in Seattle waiting for it:)\r\n\r\n    Have a pleasant month off. I’ll call you the last week of January with the new schedule. Please call me at home if you have any scheduling requests for the first 2 weeks of February.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for a great season and all your hard work. Love you all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2009 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    STEALING CHRISTMAS\r\n    Alright, it’s official. On Saturday 1/2/10 we will take the Christmas decoration down in the lobby. Please put everything neatly away in the boxes in the back. Seth will remove the tree that day as well.\r\n\r\n    BOOMTIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    When entering a boomtime GC into WRP, please know the GC buyer has been charged already. So simply input a gift certificate with the boomtime # as the confirmation number, the recipient as the guest name and write in the guest remarks: boomtime GC for bla bla $ from (buyer’s name), no restrictions, name, initial.\r\n    Then go to the payment screen and charge as a gift certificate the amount the GC is for.\r\n    Then, when submitting the reconciliation report to Cindy, highlight the GC charge (will show up as cash) and write “Boomtime” next to it.\r\n    Questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n    Happy chilly end of the year everybody.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 27th, 2009 at 9:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    I hope everyone had a wonderful christmas!\r\n\r\n    The guests from 314 moved to 309. Halley, could you have Raquel or Regino go check it out, make sure everything is clean. They weren’t in there long, but they said it smelled like someone had cooked in there recently and the scent still hadn’t left the room. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 24th, 2009 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh man, I would have loved to hear them. They didn’t sing for you? What kind of Christmas spirit is that?\r\n\r\n    SPA JETS\r\n    Dave ordered a part and we’ll have those jets fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    WATER HEATER BUILDING C\r\n    We got us a water heater for Christmas, yeah! Building C and the laundry room are back in business.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK COMPUTER\r\n    BR’s computer screen died this morning. As per Cindy I installed our server screen down there. The dead screen is in BR’s luggage room.\r\n\r\n    FELICITY\r\n    Brought us delicious homemade cookies. Check them out. I know I will.\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas Eve. Tonight at 8:00: “It’s a Wonderful Life”. Tonight at 8:08: Steffi starts weeping.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2009 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    “The German Club” came in to sing you Christmas carols, accordion and all. They asked for the women in the red jacket.. they were really disappointed when they saw that it was me here and not you. They said they would come back next year…\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas everyone!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2009 at 6:19 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN, KHAILI & HALLEY\r\n    Apples of my eye, my front desk warriors, my team. I feel like a broken record saying this: I NEED you to COUNT the TILL when you work at night. This week we were under $45, last week it was $20. I can’t figure out what may have happened if I don’t know when it happened. If this happens again, I will write you up. I still love you, but I will.\r\n\r\n    SPA JETS\r\n    Morgan, they aren’t working. Can you have a look, please and blog about any tricks you may know?\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Either our water heater got delivered or Aliens have landed in front of building C. In which case you don’t have to count the till. Just run!\r\n\r\n    CHECK-INS CHRISTMAS\r\n    Khaili and Halley, will you please call all our check-ins for 12/24 and 12/25 and let them know our opening hours? Please write in the guest comment section that you called and what our guests said. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Will be leaving for Alaska tomorrow and will be gone for a week. Please call Cindy or I for maintenance issues. If it’s something minor, call Regino or DIY.\r\n\r\n    Also: count the till.\r\n\r\n    Happy beginning of Winter, everybody. Shortest day – check, and onward.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Kidding about the trip advisors… I just read the e-mail.\r\n    Oops :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2009 at 2:02 pm\r\n\r\n    There are two new trip advisor reviews.. check them out\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 17th, 2009 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    You are so welcome, Laura.

Can you assemble them, please?\r\n\r\n    Oh, you know who has lived in the US of A for 13 years today? This girl! Thanks for having me.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 16th, 2009 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi and Daniel are my new superheros. What is their special power you may ask… Carrying wood. Yes, they saved this soon-to-be fire-starved woman. The dynamic duo brought and stacked an entire load of beautiful rounds under my deck yesterday. What a wonderful treat to come home to. Thank you for saving my back side!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 14th, 2009 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, thank you guys, for a pleasant evening. I’m still dreaming about the food. Morgan’s wings, Dave’s salmon and Pete’s duck were absolutely to die for. Thank you for the various song and dance performances (most of you missed the late night disco hour, uh BR girls, I love you!)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 14th, 2009 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a wonderful, cheerful Christmas party, the gift exchange was a hit….\r\n    I have ordered coffee for EB lobby.\r\n    Thank you Steffi and Morgan (and who ever else) for cleaning up after the party was over.. :)\r\n    There was snow at my house and then I came to town and it was gone, I think I will go back home….\r\n    Happy Monday..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2009 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Our new hot water heater that works the laundry room and building C and the conference room, will not be here until Friday the 18th at the earliest.. I have blocked out building C..\r\n    Don’t forget about the party on Sunday… Christmas is upon us..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2009 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    336\r\n    The guys who moved from 314 to 336 today called and said they forgot a bag in 314. I went in there and couldn’t find it. Please let them know.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL is off tomorrow. Call her at home, if it’s important. Or better yet, call Regino or I.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 10th, 2009 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Our water heater died in building C:(\r\n    Moved all guests. 325 needs to be cleaned. Waiting for further instructions from the WBL’s (wonderful boss ladies).\r\n    Stay warm, everybody.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 10th, 2009 at 11:10 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys,\r\n\r\n    Long time, me no post.\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to give you guys a heads up for the busy season. I know, at this point, you’re wondering what busy season, that seems like so far away. But it will come again and when it does, we will need to refer to other properties.\r\n\r\n    Among the other great properties to whom we refer, I would like you to consider referring our guests to the Friday Harbor Suites when we are sold out. They will be referring back to us as well. Their units are quite lovely and they have water views. They are located above the Golden Triangle. Check out their website at http://www.sanjuanislandsuites.com and if you have time call them to see them up close and personal. Their telephone number is 317-6423.\r\n\r\n    These folks will be coming by to take a closer look at our properties as well. Please be your normal gracious selves.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    December 6th, 2009 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone!!!\r\n\r\n    I realized I haven’t written on here in ages, so I thought I’d give you all a little shout :)\r\n    Our hotel is so beautiful, many thanks to everyone who made it the winter wonderland it is! I love driving by it at night. I especially love our REAL Christmas tree in the lobby. Not many businesses can boast that, lol. It smells great.\r\n    HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!\r\n    -Halley\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 4th, 2009 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    INVALID CREDIT CARD\r\n    WRP has a new trick or tick, rather. Whenever you edit a reservation and save, it gives you the “invalid cc” error. It’s lying. The credit cards aren’t invalid. All you need to do is select what credit card type you got (visa, master, amex) and it lets you save.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2009 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s gorgeous out. I can’t believe it’s December. My rosebush at home is still making flowers and my tulips are coming. The latter I think will be in for a frosty surprise.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS CARDS\r\n    Morgan & Halley, please sign the Christmas cards on my desk.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS TREE\r\n    Comes on Saturday. Seth will put it up. Please decorate with ornaments from luggage room.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS DECORATING CONTEST\r\n    The judging is tonight. Wish us luck!\r\n\r\n    BOOMTIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    We don’t get them very often. They come via email and are already paid. Make a reservation in WRP, select “gift certificate only, room still available” in guest status, import recipient’s name, write in guest remarks “boomtime gift certificate, bla bla amount, no restrictions)”, charge bla bla amount as gift certificate, and – this is important – use boomtime gift certificate number as confirmation number (see sample on my pin board). Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    KHAI – THURSDAY 12/10\r\n    We cut that shift, so you won’t have to work that night. Good and bad, eh? Thanks for bearing with us during this time of the year.\r\n\r\n    THE MONEY$$$$$$$$\r\n    Please count the till at night. Every night. Please. Really. Just do it.\r\n\r\n    Happy B-day, Mia. Now you’re a pre-teen. Have a fabulous day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2009 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    Hope you all enjoyed your Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to note that the cash drawer was a little short tonight.\r\n\r\n    See you on Wednesday :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2009 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    Have a wonderful Thanksgiving everyone… I am thankful for all of you :) ..\r\n    Morgan can you carry on with putting the lights up in the windows inside the office :)\r\n    Gift shop purchases\r\n    When making a pos charge, and taking the payment, please make sure you only enter the amount of the sale, so for instance if it is for $15.25, and the guests give you a $20.00 don’t enter $20.00, enter the $15.25.\r\n    Cancellation fee\r\n    If a guest cancels and we have the 10% fee still on the reservation, make sure you go in and post a cancellation fee so that the account does not show a credit balance.\r\n    Thanks everyone, eat lots of TURKEY…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 24th, 2009 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB JETS\r\n    New hot tub jets button is ordered. Should be here next week. Until then, they do work, you just have to patiently, gently and softly push a couple of times.\r\n\r\n    Happy Thanksgiving everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2009 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB JETS\r\n    Yeah, it seems they might be going. Can we have them checked out? It’s frustrating for our guests and frustration is not what we want them to experience.\r\n    It stopped blowing, is that nice.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2009 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN SUNDAY 11/29\r\n    We will be closing Bird Rock on Sunday, 11/29. Dani will make breakfast for our guests and wish them farewell. Morgan, would you go down to Bird Rock and help Dani close the hotel that day, please? Alternately if you can’t get away, walk her through it, then go down there at shift change and do a final walk through. Thank you so much.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2009 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n\r\n    Couple of things. First, the hot tub jets were being fussy. Have Seth or Morgan check them out.\r\n    Second, there were dishes left in the sink in the Wind Place.. might want to let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    Goodnight!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2009 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    Beach Cruisers\r\n    We are going to move our beach cruiser (4 of them) into the maintenance shop, please remember to still offer them to our guests, the only difference will be you will have to walk up to maintenance to get them when they are requested.\r\n    Staff Christmas Party\r\n    December 13, 2009 @ 5:00pm, please bring yourself and family or friend to the Earthbox annual Christmas lobby party :) Bring your favorite appetizer and a gift ($15.00 spending limit) if you would like to participate in our gift game. Make sure the gift is unisex..\r\n    Cheers…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2009 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER MEETING\r\n    Somebody left their purse at the meeting tonight. The chamber of commerce people took it with them. If that person calls, please have her go to the Chamber to retrieve it.\r\n    Uh, Felicity let me try some of her hors d’oeuvres. She is a real artist, yummy.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2009 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    331\r\n    Has an electrical issue. See maintenance report. I blocked it out for a couple of days. Keep me posted.\r\n\r\n    Happy Fall of the Wall day (20 years, wow, I’m getting old).\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2009 at 12:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you Morgan for posting the new report that I would like you all to run every morning. With this wind it seems likely we may experience a lovely outage..\r\n    Kitchen\r\n    I have a simple request for cleaning~when you are on your shifts please remember to clean out the sink by the coffee maker,just remove the strainers and spray the sink with the bleach water bottle, also spray the strainers with cleaner, let it set for a while and then scrub out the sink and strainers with the sponge, the strainers get REALLY gross and this has to be done.. Remember to rinse the sponge good so it doesn’t get stinky..\r\n    Keys\r\n    Keep the little key cards organized. This does not take time and is easier to take a key out when they are all in order.\r\n    Money\r\n    Please make sure we have enough change during the week when you are on your shift, if we don’t have enough small bills feel free to walk over to the bank and change some big bills for little bills, also when you do this you can check to see if the money is all going the same way in the cash drawer, it makes it faster to take money out when it is organized.\r\n    So I am on a organized kick… So remember the small things..\r\n    Stay warm everyone.. Thanks for all the stuff you do and for listening to the little requests as well as the big ones..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2009 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE/NO INTERNET\r\n    In addition to what Morgan said below: call Laura. Between her lap top and her phone she most likely can access our reservation system.\r\n\r\n    WHEN RAQUEL CALLS AT NIGHT\r\n    What she wants to know is how many rooms are checking out and staying over the following day. She is not getting the correct info from us, which is frustrating for her. So, when she calls, please do the following in WRP:\r\n    1) go to tomorrows date\r\n    2) go to “check outs”, scroll to the bottom of the page, let her know how many there are\r\n    3) go to “check ins”, scroll to the bottom of the page and let her know how many “stay throughs” there are\r\n    4) Double check that you are really on tomorrow’s date, not today, not some other date, only tomorrow’s date.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Will serve their last supper of the season on December 19 and will re-open in mid February.\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    Somebody updated the event calender on our website for the holiday season. Mhm, who could that be? Check it out. Let me know if you know of an event I have missed.\r\n\r\n    Happy blowy night.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2009 at 10:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SUMMER IN NOVEMBER\r\n    We have a soccer team staying here tonight. It is so lovely to see all those kids get excited about everything, ferry, rain, pizza, the pool (”I don’t want to have dinner, I want to go swimming”). I never consciously thought about this, but as soon as the season is over, we don’t have little guests anymore, babies and puppies and adults only. Not that I don’t love our baby, puppy and adult guests, but it is lovely to have a night of summer kid energy. Thank you, soccer team. And a good game to you, tomorrow.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2009 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all,\r\n\r\n    Seeing as we are getting into the stormy season and power/internet can quickly become unreliable, we need to start printing out the day’s check-in receipts. It’s quite easy. Just go to the check-ins page and at the top of the screen you will see a link that says, “Print day’s PDF receipts.” Hit that, it’ll think for a sec, then print off one copy of the pages it displays. Simple. If you have questions please ask.\r\n\r\n    Laters!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 4th, 2009 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello!\r\n\r\n    Not really anything to report, just thought you guys might like to see a pointless blog post from me..ooookay, see you on Sunday :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2009 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BIRD ROCK BIRD ROCK\r\n    Until Thursday:\r\n    Please don’t forget to answer the phone: “Earthbox & Birdrock, this is bla bla, how can I help you?” when the 5800 number rings (make sure you say “Bla Bla” and not your real name, for security reasons).\r\n    Bird Rock’s emails come to our inbox (thanks Mo). They are flagged purple. Please answer them.\r\n    Please check Bird Rock’s WRP several times per day for new bookings. If we have new bookings for Thursday, please call guest and let them know that the hotel will open at 1PM and let Cindy or Laura know (some rooms down there have yet to be cleaned and if we get bookings for Thursday we need to arrange for housekeeping) (did you want to know all this?) (there is more) (there is always more) (just ask)\r\n    On Thursday:\r\n    Please change email settings so Bird Rock’s emails stop coming here (instructions on pin-board above my desk).\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    S out\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2009 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    A guest checked in to 334 and then moved to 306 because they decided they wanted to bring their dog into their room. I marked 334 as dirty, just want to make sure housekeeping gets to it.\r\n\r\n    314 has three robes, Morgan, can you make sure they are left in there?\r\n\r\n    That’s all for tonight, hope everyone had a good Halloween!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2009 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n\r\n    It was my first night closing, I hope everything was up to par. It was kind of crazy with walk ins and such. Also, a guy dropped off the coffee for the rroms. I left the invoice in the box and put it in our back room, is this what I should have done? Have a great day,openers!\r\n\r\n    -Halley\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot tub is warming up… Yah… It should be ready by Saturday AM..\r\n    It is suppose to get windy so hang on….\r\n    Have a great weekend..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2009 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    I made a holiday restaurant schedule this evening. I put one in Cindy’s basket and one in the basket on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, no new to pass on.\r\n    Hope you all have a good rest of the week.\r\n    See you on Saturday.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 27th, 2009 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n\r\n    The man from SJ Coffee dropped off the coffee and installed a new filter. Yay for clean water!\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I apologize.. I forgot to count the money on Sunday.\r\n\r\n    I also didn’t take out the trash tonight because it wasn’t even a quarter full.\r\n\r\n    We received a great e-mail from a guest this evening. Goooo Morgan! Check it out.\r\n\r\n    Have a good morning, Halley. See you in the afternoon!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Is ordered.\r\n\r\n    TILL\r\n    Please count the till every night.\r\n\r\n    WINE OPENERS\r\n    We don’t have any. Can you please ask Raquel if she retrieved some from the rooms? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BENIDO CHAVEZ\r\n    What a great name. He will call for a room, in connection with a Legion event on 11/14. Please give him our lowest midweek queen room rate.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n\r\n    The weather is wild, sun, rain, sun, rain. I like it. Also love the guest contact we can have now, in the off season. I had such good chats all night. Thank you, lovely guests.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Rob has ordered the new pump, it may be here today.. I will keep you posted.\r\n    Thanks so much for starting those courtesy calls, I think this will really help in making sure our guests get everything there little hearts desire during their stay with us. :) Remember all the details matter..\r\n    Happy Monday,\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    Domestic Violence Fundraiser Event discount. We are offering a 20% off discount to anyone attending this event, guests should know to ask for that discount by name.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Courtesy calls are fun.\r\n\r\n    Everything went well today, nothing to report.\r\n\r\n    See you on Tuesday!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2009 at 4:47 pm\r\n\r\n    COURTESY CALLS\r\n    As of yesterday, we are calling our guests in their room about 15 minutes after they checked in. We ask if everything is fine, if they need anything and if they are comfortable. Afterward we write a quick note in the guest comment section in WRP, stating that we made that call, what the guest response was, date and initial. It’s great fun, check it out.\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Is broken. Please apologize to our guests. We’ll fix this as soon as we can. Rob will stop by tomorrow and have a look. If we need parts they will need to be ordered on Monday.\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    You better come out of that room and show me your homecoming dress. I’m on pins and needles here, girl! Have fun, Sweety!\r\n    A woman named Allison will stop by tomorrow to check out the conference center for a possible yoga retreat. Please show her around. She and her friend may stay the night. Give her a good deal, please.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 23rd, 2009 at 3:20 am\r\n\r\n    Boy, I am starting to think you’re right Khai, the odd stuff only happens when I’m working.\r\n\r\n    Ok. Had to move the folks in 118 because water was leaking in pretty steadily from the back corner of the room near the fridge. Water had pooled enough to make it all the way to the front door. It thankfully mostly kept to the right side of the room. The poor folks would have probably woken up to a lake if their dog hadn’t made some noise. I moved them to 116 so please let Housekeeping know they will have to do a big clean on that room once they are out. I laid down a bunch of old pool towels to try and contain the water. I wasn’t sure what else to do. Please make sue Seth knows about the problem first thing so he can deal with it. Hopefully the floor isn’t damaged. I left alarms and blocked out the room through the 7th. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2009 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a fabulous staff meeting today.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Khai, money is all good. I think Seth took some money to get a repair done, and tonight I had a receipt and all the cash. Thank you for noticing:)\r\n\r\n    333 & 310\r\n    Need to be cleaned. Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    I like the new lights along the back fence by the spa, very classy.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    October 21st, 2009 at 9:27 pm\r\n\r\n    There are three new keys in the cupboard for the conference room.Thank you Cindy.\r\n\r\n    The cash drawer was off this evening. I didn’t take any cash today, I’m not sure what happened. I filled out the sheet though, Steffi you might want to take a look.\r\n\r\n    Laura and the girls were busy out by the pool carving lots of pumpkins :) Crazy that it is almost Halloween!\r\n\r\n    See you all tomorrow at the meeting\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 21st, 2009 at 3:09 pm\r\n\r\n    A man named Dan Kahn called about getting a room for tomorrow but wanted to know first if we had feathers in our bedding. I told him I’d need to put him on hold so I could ask Cindy but he was in a hurry and just said he’d call or walk in tomorrow when he gets to the island. I told him we had multiple water rooms available. Also, a woman named Patricia Manly called to check rates and wants to stay in a sky place 0n 11/10/09 for 1 or 2 nights but had to check with her husband before booking. She’ll call back and just wanted me to leave a note for the front desk staff so they’d know her when she called. Anyways, rock on my bad*$! co-workers! see ya tomorrow!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 18th, 2009 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Slow night, got lots of cleaning in :)\r\n\r\n    Don’t forget to bring the clothes on the back desk to Post San Juan.\r\n\r\n    See you on Wednesday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    Regino and Raquel will be off-island on Sat. Orozco will be in charge. Raquel’s keys and cell phone are on the back desk for her.\r\n\r\n    1902418 was an after-hours check in. They should bring a signed copy of the invoice into the front desk in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s it.\r\n\r\n    PS. Watch Pandora like a hawk. Suddenly it thinks we all need to get religion and has been randomly playing christian praise music on the Groove channel.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation 1902512 was booked by Esary Roofing in Burlington for four of their employees. After booking, the woman asked if she was given the business rate. She has been a repeat customer of ours throughout this summer. I gave her the best rate offered, what are our business rates? And if I didn’t give her that rate, please correct the reservation. Thank you!\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 11:14 am\r\n\r\n    Cindy,\r\n\r\n    Kathy from The Place would like for you to get back to her about the voucher she had turned in a couple weeks ago. She wants to know if it has been sent or if it is available for pick-up at Earthbox. Thank you\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 7:21 am\r\n\r\n    ORCA KITCHEN\r\n    Some workers from Pelindaba called me at 6 in the morning trying to get into the Orca Room. They told me Felicity said it was ok. We get inside an lo and behold there is Lavender oil and whatnot all over the place. Well this message is two-fold. Can we make sure Felicity knows that we don’t open before 8 so she should get a key the night before? And secondly. The front door to the conference room is jammed. I couldn’t open it from the outside or inside. Please let Seth know. On that note I gave the girls working for Pelindaba a spare key to the kitchen. Please make sure we get it back. (PS I love starting the day off with an allergy attack)\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    I am very sorry. I am not sure what took hold in the pool. I thought I had it under control before I went to go off-island. I worked on it again later yesterday evening. Everything looked like it was going away and the chemical levels were fine. Sadly, it looks like it made a comeback overnight. I spent some time in there this morning and I should have gotten it taken care of. I will continue to check it throughout the day but I hope it will begin clearing out. Again I am very sorry.\r\n\r\n    Call me if you have any questions. I will be around here and there until my shift starts. I am having to take care of my mother since she had surgery yesterday.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 9:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone-\r\n\r\n    Thanks so much for bringing me on board, it’s been surprisingly fun :) I was secretly nervous about learning a new system, but it’s been great. Steffi and Morgan- An especially big thanks to you, I really appreciate your patience with my many, many questions. Hopefully I do ya proud. Tonight I had my first phone answering experiences, and I felt pretty comfortable. Steffi will let you know how I really did ;)\r\n    Adios amigos!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Sadie, thanks for making the menu guide all pretty.\r\n\r\n    ICE MACHINE\r\n    Is not working. Sounds like it has electricity, but no ice. Couldn’t check the breaker box because it’s locked, why? Cindy, can you have Seth look at it tomorrow, please? I bought some ice. There is a little left in our employee freezer.\r\n\r\n    UPGRADE\r\n    Now in the shoulder season, please upgrade our guests into nicer rooms if we have them and if they want to. For example if somebody reserved a Water Place, ask them if they would like to stay in a Sky Place. Thank you.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    The cellphone charger and scarf (hopefully) belonging to the woman from 1843421 was picked up by Angie from Exploritas today. She will give the scarf back to lost and found if it isn’t the woman’s.\r\n\r\n    I usually can’t stand any bit of cold in the air, but I have to admit, it’s pretty refreshing! See you tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2009 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n\r\n    Steffi- The SATs were good…. its a long day of testing but I feel like I did alright. I will just have to wait and see..\r\n    thanks for asking :)\r\n\r\n    I left a message on the woman’s phone who left the scarf.\r\n\r\n    The women from 1843421 believes she left her scarf in her room. Sadie, please check with Raquel in the morning.\r\n\r\n    Alright, have a good rest of the week everyone. See you on Saturday.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2009 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!\r\n\r\n    There is a name tag necklace with a note for Pat(Exploritas leader) on Steffi’s desk. If Pat comes by, please give it to him.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2009 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    EXPLORITAS\r\n    ADVENTURES IN LIFELONG LEARNING\r\n    That’s right. Elderhostel changed their name and concept a little. Please read their mission statement on the white board and from now on, call our favorite shoulder season group by their new name: Exploritas.\r\n\r\n    HOT SAUCE STORE\r\n    Did you know locals get a 10% discount at the hot sauce store? I had to learn it the soft way.\r\n\r\n    ROVER\r\n    If you see our Exploritas guest with the service dog, you have to let him show you how Rover alerts him to sounds. Totally amazing.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Please don’t forget to count the till at night. Every night.\r\n\r\n    Happy week, everybody. Thank you, Morgan for your excellent help training Halley. Thank you, Halley, for catching on so quickly. Call us all on Thursday night, that’s Halley’s first “pick up the phones” shift, oh yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2009 at 1:27 pm\r\n\r\n    How did your test go, Khai?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2009 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan:\r\n    1892580 left their pillow in 309 this morning. Can you ask Raquel and Regino if they found it,please? If its found, his number is on file.\r\n\r\n    1869583 canceled their reservation this evening. They had ordered a romance package, so I called and left a message with SJF letting them know to cancel the flowers and chocolates. Would you mind double checking with them to make sure they got my message without a problem? I realized I talk really fast on answering machines and sometimes people have a hard time understanding what I am saying.. really need to work on that. Ooops.\r\n\r\n    217 has a light bulb that is burnt out. They didn’t want to be disturbed tonight so they asked if someone could do it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Thank you sooo much, Steffi and Sadie, for covering for me on Saturday. I really appreciate it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2009 at 1:01 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    - Please tell housekeeping that 343 was dirty. I had set up an after-hours check-in for that room and it wasn’t clean.\r\n\r\n    - 1892244 was a no show at closing. I called the number on file and left a message ~9:30pm looking for them.\r\n\r\n    - Strawberries have been picked up for 1886757. They are in the fridge.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2009 at 2:38 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s been an incredibly busy day!! Much to do…\r\n\r\n    Steffi, flowers have been ordered from San Juan Florists for October 16th.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 8th, 2009 at 3:45 pm\r\n\r\n    ALL FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    Please join us on Thursday 10/22/09 at 3PM in the Earthbox Lobby for an all front desk staff meeting. This is a mandatory meeting. Sadie and Dani may join us, but don’t have to (maybe you can woman the front desks during the meeting).\r\n\r\n    SADIE\r\n    I arranged for a taxi for some of our Elderhostel guests before we open. The cab driver will come back at 8 for payment, please pay him out of the till (and give a little tip, they have such a bum deal in the off season). Many other Elderhostel guests will need rides throughout the day. Please call Regino.\r\n    Also: please let me tell you about an early arrival of the Silent World diving group on Saturday. Call me around 2 at BR (in case I don’t catch you).\r\n\r\n    FRAMES\r\n    Our broken frames are repaired and ready for pick up from Friday Harbor Art Studio. Please get them tomorrow, Morgan.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY STAFFING\r\n    Khai has her SAT test on Saturday (we will all be thinking about you:). Sadie will open EB, I will relieve her at noon. Morgan will take over his regular shift at 2. Halley was supposed to be training today, but is sick (hope, you feel better soon). She will let us know if she feels better on Saturday for her next training shift. Morgan, her training check list is in my box. Because of today’s missed training we have just covered key-making and a tiny glimpse into WRP.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY GROUP\r\n    We’ll have a small diving group staying with us on Saturday. Please charge card on file, make keys and give invoice to group leader. Rooming list is in my box.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 7th, 2009 at 10:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Wednesday!\r\n    I LOVE this weather! Its perfect for me. Fall is my favorite, even when it is raining :)\r\n\r\n    The sink in the kitchen seemed to be draining a little slow, maybe we should have Seth take a look at it?\r\n\r\n    Steffi, this is a reminder to call me about the potential shift switching on Saturday, in case you didn’t get my message.. or two.. haha.\r\n\r\n    I didn’t take out the trash tonight because there was barely anything in them. I figured we should save the bags.\r\n\r\n    Have I mentioned I LOOOVE this weather? ;)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 6th, 2009 at 9:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing too exciting tonight. Lots of guests in the lobby. Had some wonderful conversations :)\r\n    Be back tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 5th, 2009 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Halley and I had a great time training today. She will be up on speed in no time, yeah!\r\n\r\n    PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO:\r\n\r\n    1) Bring items forgotten by guests to Post San Juan ASAP.\r\n\r\n    2) Straighten out the chairs in front of building E whenever they have been moved around, but at least in the morning and at night.\r\n\r\n    3)Count the till every night.\r\n\r\n    4) Vacuum the lobby at least once per day.\r\n\r\n    5) Fill out your daily check list and put in my box for every shift.\r\n\r\n    Do it or the paycheck fairy won’t come (kidding, of course, but please do it:)\r\n    Happy sunny week, everybody!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 5th, 2009 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    What a morning, the sun is out and it has that fall crisp feeling… We live in paradise, I was reminded of that while I was tromping around downtown Seattle this weekend, the city is full of exciting things to do and see and of course buy, but to arrive home with the beautiful moon shinning on the pristine waters is unbelievable.\r\n    Have you all checked out the fancy new deck in the back yard? Seth is doing an amazing job on.\r\n    Remember to welcome Haley from the spa today, she is starting her training here with Steffi.. Welcome Haley:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2009 at 9:28 pm\r\n\r\n    CHANGE…\r\n    …we can believe in…..\r\n    Morgan, when you do the mail tomorrow, can you get us some 1’s and 5’s please? Look in petty cash for large bills. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2009 at 8:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Uh, I love our Elderhostel guests. Everybody is so sweet, excited to be here and so aware to be here. I’m having a blast. I had discussions with several people about water usage. Let’s remind Raquel to remind our lovely housekeepers to leave the towels when they are hung up and only take the ones laying on the floor. Several people were concerned we wash the sheets every day. These folks mean it. I told them we will change them only on the third day. One couple insisted to leave their sheets the same during the entire stay (that would be the Argentinians who want to teach me to tango, oh my).\r\n\r\n    Again I had a chance to impress several people with our new remotes, so easy to program, oh yeah (they think I’m a technological genius, ha)!\r\n\r\n    We need to get our guest directories together soon. I keep taking them from empty rooms to guests in need, but on nights like tonight it’s hard to find one.\r\n\r\n    And then there is the harvest moon. Wow. One of those days were I’m just grateful to be allowed to live here.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2009 at 9:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Morgan, superfrontdeskstaffpersonhero!!!!\r\n    You got slammed today. Great job hanging in there and not dropping any balls. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 2nd, 2009 at 3:31 pm\r\n\r\n    321-202 SWITCHEROO (I’m rhyming!)\r\n    Our guests in 202 really wanted an i-pod docking radio, so I switched their alarm clock with the i-pod thingy from 321. Morgan, can you please let Raquel know to switch them back on Sunday? Do you know if you need that little cable to play music? I couldn’t find one on any i-pod radio, mhm.\r\n\r\n    EMAIL NO SERVE\r\n    Our email still doesn’t work and Chris didn’t stop by. Please call him again tomorrow, Mo.\r\n\r\n    MEDICINE LEFT IN WIND PLACE\r\n    Our guest checking out of the Wind Place today left some things in the fridge. Most important some compounded medicine for their kid. Please ask Raquel first thing tomorrow if found. They are still vacationing on the island and will need the medicine.\r\n\r\n    LA LISTA DE VERIFICATION\r\n    There are printed out copies on the back desk by the beach cruiser release forms:)\r\n\r\n    10-10-2009\r\n    Khai, could you maybe just switch with Mo on that Saturday? How long does the test run? Got your day off requests for later in October.\r\n\r\n    SUSIE’S\r\n    Will pick up their moped tomorrow. They rent with a day’s notice until 10/15 and then they are done for the season. Fall, here we come!\r\n\r\n    LA MUSICA\r\n    I love the new play-lists, Laura. Thank you.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 1st, 2009 at 8:27 am\r\n\r\n    PANDORA\r\n\r\n    Okay, so at the risk of annoying everyone who works the front desk, I am going to set limits on Pandora. No more adding new artists. As you all know, I’m all about the details and music is a big part of it. I know that my musical tastes don’t reflect all of yours and I’m sorry about that. But we have a very specific image we want to present and when you change the music, you change the image.\r\n\r\n    So, if you would like to add a new artist, run it by me first. I will make several different stations so that you can flip between them, if you get maxed out on one.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for your understanding!\r\n\r\n    The Party Pooper.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2009 at 9:31 pm\r\n\r\n    ¿Dónde está la lista de verificación?\r\n    Apparently the front desk checklist has been moved from the desktop, and I cannot find it…\r\n\r\n    Some people from the Icelandic group will be charging long distance calls from their room. One man came to put his credit card on file this afternoon but I realized all the rooms were under one reservation so I just wrote his cc info in the reservation notes. I’m assuming more of them will make calls. What would be a more efficient way to arrange this?\r\n\r\n    It was a good night here at Earthbox. I’ll be back tomorrow :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2009 at 1:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone..\r\n    The spa called today, they have new hours..\r\n    Monday thru Thursday they will be open from 12:00pm to 6:15pm, the last appointment being 5:15pm, Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be normal business hours. Of course if you have a guest that would like appointments at times that they are not open you may call the spa and they will try to get a therapist in for the appointment.\r\n    There was some money in an envelope in the safe with Stefan’s name on it, did anyone know where that came from it was dated 9-5-09? It looks like a drop but i just found it?\r\n    Morgan, thanks again for this morning.. your the BEST…\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    September 29th, 2009 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Helloooo….\r\n\r\n    Very, very, quiet night. Not much to report. Cindy, I looked for the ASB card but never did find it. This is my last night here for the season. Hope everyone has a great winter, and I am sure I will be seeing everyone around town. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2009 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER MEN’S ROOM\r\n    needs to be unlocked. Regino said Elderhostel has a key, but they called me to ask for it. Can you please make sure that somebody opens that tomorrow?\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    Hairdryer doesn’t work. I brought a spare. Wrote maintenance request.\r\n\r\n    Chilly tonight. Turned on the lobby heater for the first time. Brrrrr. Alright, it’s the end of September. I guess it’s allowed to be a little chilly.\r\n\r\n    AMAZING WILDLIFE\r\n    You know the guests we had for the memorial on Sunday? They had the ceremony out at Lime Kiln Park to celebrate his love for the whales. And just when they were starting, J-Pod came by and swam and jumped around for hours. Isn’t that something? Gave me goose bumps.\r\n\r\n    Another thing which gave me goose bumps, but in a different way: last night I drove home, foggy, and I see those little eyes. I slow way down and it’s a fox dragging some junks of meat across the street. I think to myself: huh, what is he snacking upon? And I look and it’s another (dead) fox. Yuk.\r\n    And that were the wildlife news.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 27th, 2009 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Mo,\r\n    I hope you feel better. All is good. Please let HK know to tidy/clean 216. Cindy’s fam was spending time in there.\r\n    Wow, I love the new remote controls. You don’t have to go to remote control college to input a code, super easy, yeah!\r\n    See you soon.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 24th, 2009 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Sadie and Morgan,\r\n    Cindy is off for the weekend. Sadie, call me at home if you have questions.\r\n    Morgan, I put a couple of thingies to do in your box. The Elderhostel one is time sensitive, please tackle soon.\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget to go through upcoming reservations when you have a moment. Found a couple of things not followed up for tomorrow, we could have caught earlier. No biggy, Sadie will make it right for those folks.\r\n\r\n    Also: we haven’t gotten the fall ferry schedules yet. Can you guys pick some up from the ferry during shift change this weekend , please?\r\n    Happy sunny weekend, everybody.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 23rd, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello\r\n\r\n    Everything is good here at Earthbox. Slow night.. I had all of my check ins by 4:30 this afternoon and not one walk in :( That being said, as per Cindy I am closing tonight at 9. Regino stopped in already to get the phone so I let him know. The front desk cell phone is almost out of battery so I put Regino’s number on the closed sign. I also changed the office hours so it says we close at 9pm. Steffi, you might want to change both of those tomorrow night :)\r\n\r\n    There will be some soccer moms from the Fusions calling to book rooms for Nov. 6-8. There aren’t rooms set aside, but there is a group folio.\r\n\r\n    The trash and recycling cans were all pretty much empty except for the bathroom and kitchen ones, so I took those out and left the rest.\r\n\r\n    Have a good rest of the week, see you on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    P.S. If a package comes for me, please call or text my cell. Thanks!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2009 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Why are there a bunch of vouchers that have made? Answer: Because Morgan and I are rockstars! Hee! Hee!\r\n\r\n    CRUISIN’ THE ISLAND\r\n    WOW! We had some guests that used the beach cruisers and went all the way out to Lime Kiln today! What a beautiful day for biking! They had a great time, and plan on taking them for a spin in the morning.\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    A big thank-you to Morgan for showing me how to program the new remotes….I think they are cool, very teal and retro.\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    I did everything on my checklist, but take out the recycling, it was only 1/2 full so I smashed it down so we do not waste a bag…go earth!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2009 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    What, nothing happens when I’m not here? Please blog a little. I want to know what’s going on, how you are feeling, what you are doing, are you having fun, are our guests having fun?\r\n\r\n    CHECK LIST\r\n    We now have our very own exciting daily check lists. They are by the beach cruiser release forms. Please fill one out for every shift you work and stick it in my box.\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL CHART\r\n    Last special chart is up. Starting October we have fantastic specials going on and won’t need it anymore.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE STATION\r\n    Morgan, can you sneak into the Orca room tomorrow and stock us up good on sugar (individual), coffee cups, TP, hot coco, cider and everything else you can get your hands on, please? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Please don’t forget to count the till every night and drop all cash income in the safe. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    POOL PATIO LIGHTS\r\n    I can’t get the rope lights to turn on. Is it me?\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Picked it up today.\r\n\r\n    I can’t get over this weather. I love it. Thank you, Rain Shadow.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2009 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday, enjoy your weekend, enjoy the sun.. We have had a gorgeous fall….\r\n    R & R\r\n    Are off island on Saturday, Orozco will be in charge :)\r\n    Morgan just found out the fence is down and the bushes are gone.. Sorry about that Morgan… It will be SO nice next week when Mr. Seth completes the fence.. No more stinky shrubs..\r\n    Check off list\r\n    Steffi is creating a closing check off list for EB, this will make it easier to make sure all the little things get taken care of before we close at night.\r\n    107 is being repaired, we had a little water leak, Seth will let us know when it is back up and running.\r\n    Enjoy..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 16th, 2009 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    307 needs to be cleaned, please let housekeeping know.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    September 15th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    map paper ordered.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2009 at 7:21 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Stefan or Cindy, can you please call Printonyx and see if our map paper is ready. We are out and Morgan ordered it last week.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Stefan, can you run to the bank and get us some 5’s please? Khai, don’t forget to count the till at night and drop any extra cash. Thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\n    302\r\n    has a package on the back desk. I keep calling, but nobody picks up. Please try some more tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    NEW SCHEDULE\r\n    is up.\r\n\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Bye bye, Sweety. It was such a pleasure working with you this season. You are amazing. Let us know if you ever need a letter of reference. Good luck with the life thing (you gonna be just fine). And please stay in touch.\r\n\r\n    Wonderful day here at EB. Lot’s of fun people, lot’s of walk-ins. This supersweet couple got me a a little bottle of vodka because they loved my customer service. How about that? Totally made my day. Thank you, sweet people, who also work customer service!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2009 at 8:31 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Guys, please remember to drop your cash income every day and count the till EVERY night.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    See Elderhostel letter on back desk. A whole group of participants want to stay longer and arrive earlier. I left a message with the guest in charge. Offer most moderate rate plus an extra 10% off for EH participants.\r\n\r\n    MORE ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    The participant’s health forms are in my box. In case of an health emergency, make sure to give the EMT’s the forms.\r\n\r\n    109\r\n    I spoke to Al today. He is thinking of staying here with his handicapped wife. I initialed our business card with the rate I quoted him. Please honor and try to give him 109 or a sun place. His wife is in a wheel chair but can walk a little.\r\n    Thank you, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2009 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    AND??????\r\n    Morgan are you an uncle yet? And Cindy a great aunt?\r\n    Happy Labor Day weekend everybody!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2009 at 10:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Morgan!\r\n    There is a gift certificate with a sticky note on it on the back desk, please read it :)\r\n\r\n    There are also some bridesmaids gifts on the back desk. The names are on the envelopes and they each also get a bottle of wine from the back desk and one white umbrella which are located in the luggage room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Please tell housekeeping that both 343 and 335 will need a tidy. Both guests moved to different rooms.\r\n\r\n    That is all.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 2:49 pm\r\n\r\n    High School Future Fair in October\r\n    I have offered a rate of $119, for a single or double room. Each individual will pay for their own reservation.\r\n    Thanks…\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Today is my last “day shift” working since school is starting. The wheels on the bus go round-n-round! :) Thanks to Khai and Cindy for working for me this morning while I was at the High School.\r\n    Not much to report. Our group is here and happy, and all is well. I cannot believe it is the last day of August….WOW!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2009 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    If a package comes for me, please call my cell phone :)\r\n    Thaaank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2009 at 9:09 am\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    I remade the keys. A good portion of them were wiped.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2009 at 6:00 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please bring bike #4 to the bike shop (breaks not good) and pick up the 2 repaired ones. We have an account with them. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    116\r\n    Needs a tidy, please let Raquel know. I moved the guests.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2009 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n\r\n    1816942… check it out.\r\n\r\n    Kois Center is doing their breakfast in the conference room instead of at the pool patio.\r\n\r\n    Everyone is in. Life is good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2009 at 5:40 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN SATURDAY\r\n    Morgan, can you please take a 1/2 hour on Saturday morning, go down to Bird Rock with the key maker and read and redo guest keys if necessary. Also, can you show whoever is down there how to permanently lock/unlock the front door with the master key. This is really important, please don’t forget. If Stefan is too busy, have Khai help him for a bit. Thank you. Please blog about it, so I know it’s done.\r\n\r\n    #1814557\r\n    Is approved by all boss ladies. Thank you, Carla:)\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL\r\n    Our housekeeping warrior is off tomorrow. Don’t bug her.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2009 at 2:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy mid-week Wednesday! Wahoo! It was busy, busy, busy this morning! The group for today is all checked-in, and all went well! They are happy! :)\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Please check reservation #1814557 and make sure it is approved by you.\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    Don’t forget about opening on Monday, thank you, thank you, thank you! I will be here right after the school district breakfast. You are an amazing rockstar! :) :)\r\n\r\n    Is it me? Or is there a lot of runners here on the island this summer? I swear every 5 minutes someone is asking me about running trails and running routes!\r\n\r\n    Hope everyone has a great rest of the week!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2009 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh in addition. The act of me printing the reconciliation report for tonight made the back printer finally run out of ink. I replaced the cartridge but we need to order another one so we have one on hand. Please tell Techie Chris that the front desk computers no longer print to the back printer again. Probably had something to do with the power outage. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    How about that power outage eh? Fun times, fun times…\r\n    Jeez I swear. It can be dead quiet and the minute I get on the phone to make a reservation I get 2 rooms calling in. Why does that happen? whew! :) Just a couple of things:\r\n    - The water heater in building A’s vent got stuck again causing the heater to turn off. Is there anything we can do to make sure it doesn’t get jammed preventing the gas from igniting?\r\n    - As I was walking back in A’s parking lot I heard this horribly annoying sound. Sounded almost like a lawn mower. I tracked the sound down to the vent hood that is coming out of the roof of Building B above the kitchen. I don’t know if that will be a West Mechanical thing or if perhaps Seth can look at it. But it randomly turns on and off so it probably should be looked at. By the way one of the refigerators in the kitchen is really, really noisy.\r\n    - Can we possibly change the the books in the room to tell the guests that the current wifi password is on their invoice? It currently tells them to call us for the current PW. I swear 90% off the calls we get from rooms are guests asking for the password. Just a thought.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! Thanks all. Have a good one.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2009 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPS THIS WEEK\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY 8/26 HEARTLAND\r\n    Will arrive on 9:50AM ferry, Regino will do luggage and people shuttle, guests know the rooms might not be ready yet. Prepare remote check-in, suppress pricing, take cc from each guest. The next day they will store luggage with us and will go to Syndey in the afternoon. Regino will handle the luggage again.\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY 8/27 KOIS\r\n    Will arrive around 5PM by private boat. Regino will do luggage and people shuttle. Prepare remote check in, suppress pricing, take cc from each guest. They will have seminars in the conference center and will have breakfast in the pool patio on Friday & Saturday. Please put sign on patio gate, saying: Kois Center Breakfast, Private Party (in my box). They will use the patio from 7AM to 10AM. Our other guests can order coffee from the pool entrance side during those times. On Saturday SJ Transit will pick up the spouses for an island tour after breakfast.\r\n    They’ll leave Saturday before noon. Regino will do shuttle.\r\n\r\n    Detailed Itineraries and rooming lists for both groups are in my box.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2009 at 2:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh! Happy Monday! It has turned out to be such a pretty day, even though it was….BRRRRR….cold this morning! Here is all of my fabulous news!\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    Morgan, Morgan, Morgan, no worries…I have folded and straightened the gift shop. It is so beautiful now. Cindy, thanks for organizing the T-shirts some more!\r\n\r\n    STOCKED COFFEE AREA\r\n    The lobby coffee table is all stocked, stocked, stocked. We still need to ask Raquel if she needs anything when we order 1/2 and 1/2. I forgot. :(\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN ROASTERS\r\n    Called and ordered more coffee today, it should be here by 3:00. They wanted me to let everyone know that they roast everyday at 11:00 a.m. Monday through Friday. We need to make sure we order coffee on Friday morning for the weekend.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2009 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew. They kept me busy tonight. Phone calls, guest needs, pool towels, the works. Gift shop got hit hard too.\r\n    -I did a little bit of tidying when I could but if no one has time tomorrow to do a full refolding, I will try to do it tomorrow night.\r\n    -I picked up new batteries for the clock.\r\n    -Steffi I am going to ask you for clarification on just how you want the cash drawer done.\r\n    -We are out of liquid creamer packets. We should ask Raquel if she needs anything then put in a Sysco order.\r\n    -That’s about it. Happy Birthday Khai!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2009 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    $$ CASH $$\r\n    As of today I need everybody to drop cash income after every shift (invoice, money in envelope, drop in safe). The night shift shall count the till every night. New, spiffy and quite exciting till counting sheets are in the cash drawer. Thanks.\r\n\r\n    BIG CLOCK\r\n    Our big lobby clock needs a battery. Can you please go get one tomorrow, Morgan?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2009 at 12:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Will be closed tomorrow and Sunday. Please make sure the guests know\r\n    Thanks guys\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    One thing before I go Regino and I could not find the front desk cell phone so I posted Regino’s phone on the door I think it will turn up but for now…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2009 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    I just said goodbye to Lilly, I am going to miss her SO much. Thanks for all your hard work this summer Lil, you were the super hero coffee barista.. Have fun In Cali and remember watch out for the creepers… (it’s a mom thing:) XO\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2009 at 7:54 pm\r\n\r\n    OK so far so good! We had a bunch of walkins which is nice just a small problem though, the screen on key maker died you can still make keys but you cannot see what you are punching. I think all of us have done it for quite some time now so you can still do it by memory if you don’t remember however Khaili and I made instructions. They are taped right next to the machine so that can help. Other then that everything is OK.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2009 at 2:23 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Now that Lilly and Cody are gone, I am going to be out there. It will be closed Mondays and Tuesdays and whenever I am working the opening shift at Earthbox. All other mornings I will be out there until my front desk shift starts.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2009 at 4:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n    Seth is going to be gone until Friday. So he will not be available for consultations or maintenance until then. So in other words let’s give him a break. He thanks you for your consideration.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2009 at 1:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! Hello! Cindy has requested that we please put the check-in reciepts and the beach cruiser release forms the same direction in the drawer. That way, if we need to go back and check something it is easier and not so much of a hassle. :) Today is great, sunny and warm, and happy guests!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2009 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Saturday :)\r\n    We now have a variety pack of band-aids located in the bathroom on the shelf. Nice.\r\n    Besides that, not much to pass on.\r\n    The sun is out today. Yaaay\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2009 at 6:09 pm\r\n\r\n    BAND AIDS\r\n    Khai, please go to the store today and get some band aids in different sizes for the lobby and for the pool. We are very low at both places.\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    We are out of remotes. I ordered more on Monday, they should have been here by now. Anybody? Well, if you need one, try to fiddle with the older ones, we have some of those in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    SIGNS\r\n    Mr. Rand dropped off some new signs. They are in the luggage room. Please let Seth know.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2009 at 9:57 am\r\n\r\n    Stefan\r\n    Grant from HP called. His number is in your box :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2009 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! I didn’t know where to put the no vacancy sign this morning. I placed it over by the wooden sign in the corner by the front door. Does it have a home? We will be needing it the next few days, wahoo! Hope everyone gets a chance to visit the San Juan County Fair! :)\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2009 at 7:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, I had a great summer here and I am planning on at least stopping in on my breaks. Pretty busy today, fully booked yet again for the next few days. Bike #1 has an awkward seat, its by Morgan’s door. Thanks again for such a fun summer, gonna miss yall! Call me and stop by Pullman anytime!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2009 at 2:40 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I left a message with all upcoming guests regarding 312’s electrical issue. They might call back for clarification.\r\n    Also: make sure to mention it to each guest booking 312 until September (when Opalco will be able to fix it).\r\n    Here’s the spiel in short: the electricity in half the room cuts out sometimes and comes right back on. It’s not dangerous, it’s not on our end.\r\n\r\n    JIM LAWSON\r\n    is the plumber working on my new house (yippieeehh!). I left an envelope for him on the back desk. Please give it to him when he stops by.\r\n\r\n    ELIOT\r\n    Bye bye, Sweetheart! It was a pleasure working with you and telling you not to text at work:) Your people skills are excellent and you will be missed by our guests. Please give Morgan your office keys and your all-access key. Have a great time at college (don’t forget to learn something as well). Let us know when you are back for breaks. Take care.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2009 at 5:59 pm\r\n\r\n    303\r\n    Bathtub drains slow. Please have Regino have a look.\r\n\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Stefan was sick today. I haven’t heard from him. Please contact me if we need to cover his shift. I have covered his Sunday shift, but haven’t found anybody for Saturday. I hope, you are feeling better, Stefan!\r\n\r\n    BASKETBALL\r\n    One of our guests donated a basketball to us. They felt like shooting hoops at sunken park and bought a cheapo ball, he won’t need at home. It’s in the luggage room. thank you!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2009 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all-\r\n    Its good to be back.\r\n    I had to use the emergency hold room for tomorrow, we had a little reservation mishap. If there is a cancellation for tomorrow, please block it out as our emergency hold room :)\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2009 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    RADIO CAMPAIGN\r\n    We are part of a radio campaign, which starts today. Potential guests can obtain Trade Scrip towards a stay. This will be treated like cash, can not be used with any other discounts or special rates. Look at the white board, read the restrictions, have me explain the details to you the next time we work together.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2009 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    312 can be rented, but make sure you tell the guests, we have an off again on again issue with the lights that cannot be fixed for 2 weeks. If they have an issue, work with them. Ask Cindy or Steffi..\r\n    I moved all kinds of people so that other guests would be able to stay in their rooms the whole time of their stay, please remember to look at the overall calendar, when we are so close to being sold out so that we can manage our space to the best of our ability..\r\n    Thanks for all your hard work..\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2009 at 10:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy night surprisingly! The lovely ladies in room 335 will be stopping by in the morning before their kayak tour and will be extending their stay in an Earthplace, I already took care of everything :) , no complaints except the internet on the guest computer stopped working for some reason? Chris is being kept busy. See yall tomorrow! get better Khaili!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2009 at 3:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, what a day, 312 is rearing it’s head AGAIN… Opalco, Electricians were fast to hunt down the issue. The bad news, it can not be fixed until possible next week, we are sold out and I have left a message with the next arriving party, please look at the monthly calender, if this happens during a stay feel free to credit.\r\n    WRP\r\n    It has been SO slow, Chris T has been talking to the support system and they will be running tests today trying to figure out what the scoop is..\r\n    Thanks so much..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew! busy busy busy. Phones ringing, guests needing stuff. Kept me running.\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n    Mr. Lin, a guest from Bird Rock, is storing some salmon he caught today in the Orca Room freezer. He will be by around 9:30am 8/5 to pick it all up. (If I haven’t stolen it all by then ;) )\r\n\r\n    Eliot – The folks in 210/211 you were trying so hard to book a kayaking trip for decided to just bag it. Sorry.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    The power returned and when the guys came with the pinpointer machine to find the location of the short between the room and the transformer box, the power came back on, so here we go again, If the power shall short again, please call Frankie at 378.8174 he will shuttle right over and get his handy dandy pinpointer out to locate the short…\r\n    WOW, we were slammed today.. YIPEE……\r\n    Until then, if we happen to lose the power, please take $50 off the guest nightly rate..\r\n    Gracias..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 1:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all! Hope everyone is having a great summer. San Juan Safaris wanted to remind us today that they are only booking 5:30 sunset tours until August 22nd. Things went well this morning. Crazy busy as usual, but all is well!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2009 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Thanks to the quick efforts of Super Dave, he had OPALCO figure out the electrical problem that 312 is having. They will be in tomorrow to fix it. We had to move the poor guest that was in there though. Please let housekeeping know that they will need to clean it tomorrow. I blocked 312 out for 2 days. Please make sure you unblock it once everything is finished. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    I was unable to find the invoice you were looking for. There is another box in the back office it could be in but I only got through part of it. Perhaps we could go through that one tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2009 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    SAVE SAFE PLEASE\r\n    Lock that thing. Seriously. Otherwise it’s only an unsafe. get it? Ha, ha.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2009 at 3:46 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING REPORTS\r\n    Hey all. Raquel and Regino ask if we could all print out the housekeeping reports without “page breaks.” That way the morning housekeeping report gets boiled down to 2-3 pages unlike the 7-8 that would come out otherwise. Thanks!\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2009 at 4:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all!\r\n\r\n    If anyone knows anything about a navy blue appointment book which was left by a previous guest of ours, Janis Smith, PLEASE let me know. I have her information and she would like for it to be sent off to her. She had left it here a while ago, about 3 weeks. She was told it had been found and now it has completely vanished. Enjoy the perfect weather!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2009 at 4:27 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI – ORDERING QUEEN\r\n    I ordered lobby coffee, room coffee (FSA), told Sysco to pick up the room coffee we don’t want/need, left message for Gerard for hot coco, apple cider, creamer and new corn starch water cups. When I had my massage the spa gave me water in this really nice corn starch cup, I would like us to have them. I put one on our ordering board, check it out.\r\n\r\n    LOBBY SUPPLY STOCKING\r\n    When we run low on things we need in the lobby, paper products, teas, hot coco, cups, etc. please go get them from the Orca room. Raquel and her crew are too busy to run errands for us right now.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    We are consistently over when I reconcile cash. When you guys get quarters out of the safe, do you put the same amount you took out of the till and put it in the safe?\r\n\r\n    Give me an earth, give me a box, what does that spell? Go team!\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW!! absurdly busy this morning! Island Gardens would like to know if we could put up a sign or something in the new gardens to prevent pets from ‘using’ them. Lavendera Day Spa would also like to remind us to ask for the name of people receiving massages. Not quite as hot today, and surprisingly many people did not die from the heat!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2009 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    It was just going to well I guess. So we could not open room 117 something wrong with the lock we wrestled with it for quite some time but in the end we managed to fix it thanks to Regino. We might have some cranky guests tomorrow because of the noise but I hope not. That’s it from me I am OFF.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2009 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    OK busy busy day. Everything went fine just some minor bumps on the road. One thing morning shift one of our guest wanted to take 2 bicycles early in the morning before it gets too hot around 6am so I let him take them. His driver’s license is still here in the office.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Holy Moly it was hot today. Wheew!!\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    The shower handle came off when they went to take a shower. They are pretty good natured folks who managed to get it working long enough for them to shower. Please have Seth take a look at it when he gets in. They are a stay-over but will be out and about early so they think they will be gone whenever he wants to go work on it.\r\n\r\n    NEW SHIRTS\r\n    We have some cool new shirts in. Cindy, all of them are priced, sorted by size, type, color, and put in the back room. I didn’t put them out because I wasn’t sure if you had a master plan for their display.\r\n\r\n    OH yeah by the way. 1000th post! Boom baby! W000000000T!!! :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2009 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Isn’t that a song by “The Cure”?\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Its hot….hot…..hot….\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2009 at 6:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Can you please make sure if you don’t make a voucher for something to make an alarm so that someone can make it later.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2009 at 7:21 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFIRM ADVENTURES WITH GUEST\r\n    We had a couple of disappointed guests today. They adventures were booked at different times than they wanted them. Please always confirm with the guest. This is their vacation, their fun, their break. We need to do everything we can to make their trip memorable and not stressful.\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOM\r\n    We have a Water Place as an emergency room tomorrow. Please release in the early evening.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you check the printer driver on my computer one more time, please? I can’t print anything to Cindy’s printer.\r\n\r\n    BIKE # 16\r\n    Please bring to shop tomorrow, it has a slow leak in the rear tire.\r\n\r\n    LAST MINUTE SPECIALS\r\n    I will email the last minute special sheet tomorrow afternoon when I get to work at BR. Please print and use. Khai and Morgan, will you let Eliot and Sadie know what this is all about, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy weekend everybody. Enjoy the fabulous weather. Don’t forget to mention that we don’t have AC:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    337\r\n    needs to be cleaned. Please let HK know.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    I’ve put up our summer target numbers as a way for you to earn some extra cash this summer. Check it out on the white board for now. I’ll put it up in Steffi’s office in a few days.\r\n    Laura\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Front Desk Headsets\r\n    Stefan and I are the mighty headset fixers:) There is NO more scotch tape on the front desk headsets..\r\n    Window,\r\n    OOPS my office window was left open last night. Don’t forget to check back here when it is hot, before you close..\r\n    Adventure Tours\r\n    Are you making sure you tell EVERY guest that takes an adventure to check in 30 minutes prior to departure. If you are forgetting and the guest misses their trip, do you want to pay the Adventure company for the missed seats? I sure don’t want to, Please remember to tell EVERYONE the check in time and the cancellation policy..\r\n    Morgan\r\n    It seems the pool keys from the BR are able to access the pool earlier than 8am, can you please check that for me and get back to me? Also what is the status of the bike grips? Dan from the Spa place is going to come over, Seth is measuring the drains today, and taking pictures with an underwater camera and then mailing them to Dan. Then he will make an appointment to come over for the assessment.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2009 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello,\r\n\r\n    Carla\r\n    Colleen from SJ Safaris will be calling in the morning regarding the voucher on the back desk. The people missed the boat and wanted a refund. The people at SJS said she needed to talk to Colleen.\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Thank you, again, for working around my ridiculous schedule :)\r\n\r\n    Eventful night, lots of running around. There was a fun group of people in the lobby for a while, they kept me entertained with all their tourist experiences on the island.. funny stuff.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2009 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Closing duties\r\n    Please when you are the last one here, empty the bathroom garbage also, plus if you are using the bathroom and notice the garbage needs to be emptied, please take it out.\r\n    Since we have had the hot days, i have been leaving the back office windows open, please remember to close them and make sure they are locked before you close for the night.\r\n    Holding reservations\r\n    If you hold a reservation for a few hours, make sure you put the time in the notes that you told the guests you would release it if they don’t call back. Normally we don’t hold reservations but once in a while we do, but if you do, you need to follow up on it, if you are not going to be here make sure you leave an alarm and put lots of notes in the file..\r\n    Remind out guest to go to tripadvisor.com and write a review for us..\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2009 at 5:57 pm\r\n\r\n    hey guest in 333 moved to 326, if 333 could be set as dirty that would be awesome! Super Duper busy today and it is so beautiful out…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 7:30 pm\r\n\r\n    ELIOT’S TUESDAY LISTS\r\n    Please bring bike # 2 to the repair shop (brakes don’t work). See what’s wrong with the bikes by Morgan’s apartment and bring it to the repair shop if necessary.\r\n    Bring broken picture to framer on Web Street.\r\n    Provide the excellent customer service you always provide:)\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. yeah!\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Important note about the referral codes dropping in reservations: if the code drops while you are trying to change a reservation, write down what you needed to change so you don’t lose it, and go back and search for the reservation again. If it drops the code again, stop and don’t do anything else to the reservation. You are to call 800-221-3429 ext#2 and report the problem. If you are on the phone with a guest, let them know that everything will be taken care of and write down the information necessary.\r\n\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 12:35 pm\r\n\r\n    PILLOW\r\n    There is a shipping slip all filled out for a pillow that was left behind in the Wind Place. (Raquel will drop it by the office)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2009 at 11:50 am\r\n\r\n    oops, that was supposed to say “leave 339 open”…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2009 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    If you can avoid it, leave open for tonight. The nice man staying downstairs would appreciate it :)\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2009 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Can we have some one have a look at the bathroom in the wind place first thing in the morning. It smells bad. Guest said it might be a sewer leak.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2009 at 3:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of things:\r\n\r\n    First, just a reminder to make sure that we put the date and times on all vouchers.\r\n\r\n    Also, with the Free Lunch special the deal is $20 off ONE night’s stay, am I right? I have noticed that some reservations for the free lunch were getting $20 off per night…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 7:26 pm\r\n\r\n    #1732426\r\n    Please get guest’s cc info upon check out. They have an outstanding balance and WRP didn’t save their cc info. I called them, they know.\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget to release our hold room later tomorrow, once you are sure we are good.\r\n\r\n    Gorgeous, busy, sunny, fabulicious island day….\r\n    Peace\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    LANDSCAPING\r\n\r\n    We’ve got another small landscaping project going in next Monday for a few days. It will be over by the guest laundry. It shouldn’t cause too much problem, but if it does, as always, just let me know and apologize to the guests.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Remotes\r\n    Steffi, go ahead and order some from American Hotel Registry\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Cafe Zia is open every day, last week they were closed on Tuesday due to some scheduling issues.\r\n    Enjoy the weekend..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2009 at 4:02 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    On Monday, 7/20 when you work at Bird Rock, will you please order a bunch of pay per view and see if we can get that to work for our guests?\r\n\r\n    TV REMOTES\r\n    We have none. Can we please order some more?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2009 at 2:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Sun is out and Friday is around the corner :) A few things:\r\n    Wind Place\r\n    The Wind Place has a maximum of 6 people in the room, MAYBE a small baby under 2, Morgan had listed 7 maybe 8 and that is not correct, so I wanted to make sure you all knew that. The extra rate occurs after the first 4.\r\n    Dishes\r\n    We use to have a “Do your own dishes” sign in the back kitchen, but, I took that down quite a while ago. Please make sure if you have a moment when it is slow that you keep the kitchen tidy, whether they are your dishes or not. Never close the office with a dirty kitchen.. We can also, vacuum, and dust if it is slow. Throw out dead flowers and keep the front office tidy. :)\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Chris Teren took a look at the wifi today, he said everything was running good. Sometimes due to the island connectivity levels we are going to run into guests not having a great connection. Please let the guests know that you will forward their concern onto our computer tech person, then you need to call Chris T and leave him a message.\r\n    Busy weekend here on Friday Harbor, it is the A Splash of Summer Arts Fair.. Enjoy and pass it a long to our guests, It is held on the street in front of Rock Island, by the Court House.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2009 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CHANGE\r\n    We need to get some change for the cash drawer.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2009 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    WIRELESS\r\n    Got a couple of complaints about the internet being way too slow one guest ran a test and said it was running at only 190 or so KB\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2009 at 11:27 am\r\n\r\n    PARKING LOT & POOL PATIO:\r\n\r\n    Our man Seth will be restriping the parking lots this Wednesday and Thursday. Please apologize to any guests who are frustrated by this, it shouldn’t wreak too much havoc.\r\n\r\n    Seth will be restaining the pool patio next Monday, weather permitting. He will be locking the patio off for 24 hours for the stain to cure. Again, please apologize to any inconvenienced guests. Shouldn’t be too much of a biggy, Cafe Zia is closed and the pool will still be open.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    308\r\n    Light bulb needs to be replaced in the bedside lamp closest to the door. The guest is the travel writer and she is really nice. She just didn’t want to bother with it late at night.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    We are officially out again. The paper should be ready from Printoynx. Someone needs to just run up and grab it. You might want to call first to make sure though. :)\r\n\r\n    Guest 1684562 is having to leave early due to a family emergency. She had a massage scheduled for 5:15 on 7/13. I called and left a message with the spa to try and cancel it. Please call the spa in the morning to check with them. Her voucher is on the back desk and she needs to be refunded the amount of the treatment in the morning. Hopefully the spa will let her go on it, they should.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    HORNETS\r\n    I found a bottle of wasp and hornet spray and doused the opening where they were coming out. Hopefully that took care of them.\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Seth and I are pretty sure the steam out of the shower set of the alarms. There is a smoke alarm right outside the bathroom door. Apparently all four of the guests took steam showers right after the others so it probably built up too much for the bathroom vent to remove. Perhaps we could move the smoke alarm further down the hallway? Since they are all linked together once one goes off they all go off. Seth and I unplugged them from the system but since they all have their own batteries they will all still work for the time being.\r\n\r\n    331\r\n    Guests needed a “brighter” room and moved. They were only in the room for under an hour so please let housekeeping know that it will need a cleaning more than likely.\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Guests checked in an found a pool of water in the bathroom. They seem to think that the toilet may be leaking. I made up a maintenance slip and put some towels down.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLOG BLOG\r\n    Please blog more. Tell us how it was, what was good, bad, busy, not, what you promised guests, I want to know, please, please tell me!\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Fire alarm went off. Morgan and Seth are dealing with this right now. Breaking news so to speak…. Oh, it’s fixed. Live from Earthbox: Morgan and Seth rock! Apparently the steam shower set it off. Seth will look into it, all is good for now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2009 at 3:46 pm\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Just a reminder to everyone. The Wind Place rate is based on 4 people. Up to 7 people maximum are allowed in the building. (Some exceptions can be made for very small children/babies) and only 1 futon can be added to the room. That’s about it.\r\n\r\n    217\r\n    Is blocked out until tomorrow. Apparently the guests couldn’t get the water to divert to the shower and turned it so hard the spigot came off. Regino says it is an easy fix he will do in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. Lots o’ check-outs today.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2009 at 8:05 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI & ELIOT\r\n    Your time sheets are on my desk, will you please go over them and write down when you clocked out on the days with ?? and put in Cindy’s box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BEACH CRUISER WITH CHILD SEAT\r\n    One of our stay-over guest had a child seat attached to one of our bikes. Please rent that only to her and not to others. I also allowed 2 lovely ladies to take the cruisers in their car out to the Westside, just to let you know.\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS & PET POLICIES\r\n    Morgan and I made a bunch. Please keep an eye out when we get low. Make more or if you don’t know how, blog about it. There is nothing worse than to start assembling a needed voucher in the middle of a ferry rush. Well, there is, starving is worse, so is injury, heartbreak, o.k., there are worse things, but you get the point.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    Is a little iffy (Augustitis already?). Happened several times today that we made a phone reservation, saved it and all was lost. So, until we have this fixed, save after you get a guests name and phone number, so you can get back to the guest if need be.\r\n\r\n    INTERNET\r\n    Went down during ferry rush. Morgan was all over it. Our guests are the most patient wonderful people in the world, thank you. Again: print out the day’s check-ins in the morning. You never know what’s coming.\r\n\r\n    Happy busy, sunny weekend everybody. Call me at BRrrrrr if you need me.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2009 at 3:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Phone system\r\n    Frontline will only be answering the phones when we switch our phone line on the console to “night 1 ” please remember that it is SO important to try and get ever call that comes into our office,and for some reason if you cannot, get to that flashing message light ASAP..\r\n    Right now it is taking the answering machine a few too many times to go to the front desk voice mail. Bob J is working on this and we should have it resolved next week.\r\n    Please remember to send any issues you have with WRP to me via email with a detailed account of what is going on.\r\n    Looks like the weekend is upon us and the sun has returned. YAHOOOO!!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2009 at 2:48 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH DROPS\r\n    Please do not use brown Earthbox envelopes or Earthbox stickers for our cash drops. (or any in-house business) they are expensive.\r\n\r\n    A BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\r\n    Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday to Raquel from Cindy and the front desk! We love you and we think you are awesome!\r\n\r\n    Glad to see the sun is starting to come out again! Wahoo!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2009 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA (Male Practitioners)\r\n    Sealy would like us all to be aware that they now have three male practitioners. She would really like us to encourage people to give them a try. Asking guests “have you ever worked with a male practitioner?” Then encourage them to try them saying that they will be satisfied as the male practitioners are both sensitive and professional.\r\n\r\n    SPA PRICES\r\n    Some of the Spa prices have recently changed. please note the changes on the new laminated office copy\r\n\r\n    Pool fence lights won’t go on, Karlita said that the plug seems to be loose at the head, can someone have a look\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2009 at 2:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, the weather has really changed huh? All went well today. We have more map paper coming from Printonyx on Thursday, we printed off enough to get us through until then. If anyone has time tonight, we need more vouchers made for the spa. Have a great night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2009 at 10:28 am\r\n\r\n    It is good to be back (well kinda :) ) I loved my trip and am ready to return, now I know what Laura and Adam have been raving about all these years when it comes to the river, and I suspect I only experienced a little taste of it.. It would be a great team building trip……\r\n    Thank you for keeping everything going, all looks great.. the only thing I am wondering is why the bikes were not taken over to the bike shop to be repaired? Don’t hesitate to cruise (or walk) one over to Paul, he will bill us and then we don’t have any broken bikes hanging out by Morgan’s door..\r\n    Payroll\r\n    I will run the payroll report for June 25, 26, 27 and 28th, if your hours are different then what I paid you on your last paycheck I will make the adjustment on your next check.. Please don’t hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    See you all at 3PM today..\r\n    :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow! Great work all of you guys. I was so impressed at how smooth and calm and beautiful everything was at the Box today. Chaos defeated, tranquility reigns.\r\n\r\n    Lilly and I rocked it in Cafe Zia today. Lots of fun. Thanks for letting me share in the joy, Lilly.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for doing such an amazing job!\r\n\r\n    Happy Independence Day.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2009 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Fourth :)\r\n\r\n    Check out 1574924.\r\n\r\n    Another bike is added to our broken bike collection by Morgan’s porch. The tire is rubbing on frame.\r\n\r\n    Nice and busy today. Definitely not boring..\r\n    Anyways, I hope everyone has fun tonight :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PARADE CHAIRS\r\n    Khai, I printed out some signs, saying “reserved for Earthbox guests”. Please use those when putting out the chairs (have Regino help you). Also: Regino wanted some “no parking” signs, they are an my desk as well.\r\n\r\n    304\r\n    Needs a tidy (guest checked in, checked out after 20minutes). Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    SAFE\r\n    As per BL (beautiful Laura) the safe shall be locked at all times.\r\n\r\n    Great job, everybody. You rock my world.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 2:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Map paper is ordered. As is some more coffee for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    Busy busy day.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    The rate sheet is found in My Documents, Front Desk, Earthbox Pricing\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2009 at 6:26 pm\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEET\r\n    Khai, where on the computer is your fabulous new rate sheet?\r\n\r\n    CHAMPAGNE\r\n    Is here, yeah!\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Morgan, can you please order some more map paper?\r\n\r\n    323\r\n    needs to be cleaned, please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    TOMORROW\r\n    Stefan will work 9-2 (o.ked by Cindy) and I will work 2-10. That should cover us.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    Kept timing out on us today. Please print tomorrow’s check-ins, so we know what’s going on.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2009 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    Did you get the e-mail I sent you?\r\n\r\n    Also, will you check out res. 1644971. They paid cash for the room it looks like, but they charged a 10% deposit to her credit card, and they wanted to pay with their gift certificate. The gift certificate is in my box…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2009 at 5:38 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ RESERVATIONS\r\n    New quirk, no biggy, but we need to pay attention: when a Unirez reservation comes in, WRP doesn’t assign a room anymore. It has been doing this at Bird Rock ever since the software update, but here at EB only for a couple of days. So: what’s a team player to do? Easy.\r\n    1) process payment (watch out, it reverts to the full amount, not the 10% deposit, so move the comma).\r\n    2) go to edit, confirm reservation, then save.\r\n    That’s all, does the trick. Why is it doing this? Nobody knows. It’s the machines, they are taking over, ahhh, aahhhh….\r\n\r\n    UPCOMING RESERVATIONS\r\n    Please go through all upcoming reservations and make sure we meet guest’s needs (ground floor, etc.), have vouchers, addressed all questions (interested in Kayak, etc.). Next weekend is going to be big and we want to shine!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 10:38 pm\r\n\r\n    QUESTION\r\n\r\n    Does anyone know what is wrong with the internet? We have had a lot of complains about it not working or having a very weak signal where they should be getting perfect reception. Some of them say it only works at the bathroom :) . Can we have someone take a look at it?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    I finished the new rate sheet. If anyone finds any errors on there, let me know. All the old copies that I could find have been replaced.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, I think that is all.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all.\r\n    Not much to report.\r\n\r\n    One of the bike’s chains has fallen off. We have parked it next to my apartment door. I will ask Seth to fix it or, once I am not wearing this nice white shirt, I will try and fix it.\r\n\r\n    Sadly the T.A. 2000 has met with irreparable damage. It has been retired to the trash. Let us hope we do not need it’s services until we obtain a new model.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everybody, since there is no room in the gift shop I had to put most of the XL and XXL men sweatshirts in the storage room so if anyone asks for one they are in a box which says MEN SWEATSHIRTS on it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy, but good busy….\r\n\r\n    INTERNET OUTAGE\r\n    Centurytel & Rockisland are doing some repairs tonight. They should be all good to go by 6AM. Just in case something goes wrong, I printed tomorrow’s check-ins and housekeeping report.\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEET UPDATE\r\n    Khaili, I didn’t get to that today, will you do us the honors?\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    Please look at our amazing merchandise. Oh, so chic! Khaili and Stefan, can you please take an inventory tomorrow and put it in my box?\r\n\r\n    POOL DOOR\r\n    Is in, yeah, Seth! Looks fantastic. The spring for the door will be installed tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE\r\n    One of our guests will need a ride to the airport tomorrow at 8AM. Regino will pick her up (I talked to Raquel) by the lobby and give her a lift.\r\n\r\n    WEDDING\r\n    There are a bunch of gift bags on the back desk for a wedding tomorrow. We have no reservations for most of the guests listed on the bags. I gave the wedding coordinator a call. She (Becky) will get back to us with further instructions.\r\n\r\n    Thank you so much for being our gift shop king tonight, Stefan. You are a clothing rock star!\r\n\r\n    Michael Jackson died today:(\r\n\r\n    Cindy and Laura, have a wonderful time off. We’ll miss you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 4:54 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW PLANTS:\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody! You know those dead bushes in front of Building D and the brown grass by the side of the driveway? Well, they are all getting replaced next week. Island Gardens will be spending most of next week digging these areas up and putting in a whole new bed. It will all look very pretty when it is done. Hopefully it won’t cause too much havoc, but to avoid any headaches, please let our guests in Buildings D & E know when they check in that there will be a bit of landscaping work being done and if they have any problems just to let you know.\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday!\r\n    steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 1:26 pm\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK SUPER FUN STAFF MEETING\r\n    Please join us (and by that I mean: this is mandatory) on Monday, 7/6 at 3PM for an Earthbox front desk staff meeting. In case you can’t make it, please let me know ASAP. Thank you.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW that special is really working so far we’ve had around 10 online reservations. One thing I noticed though is that when you make a reservations the add-ons are not there. So maybe that is something we should have a look at.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 5:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you Khaili and Stefan for organizing the back storage/bathroom area.. HURRAY…. Steffi, I had Khai bring back the towels, sheets and blankets to housekeeping, we left 4 pet blankets up here though. We have enough people on staff this time of year that we shouldn’t need all those extras all the time, there just it not enough room.. :)\r\n    There are some white shirts on your desk, they can be for BR..\r\n    We have a temporary fax/copier in the front office, I will be ordering a new one but this one should be fine for now, thank you Chris Teren for lending it to us..\r\n    Coffee shop\r\n    Because we have the 3rd line in the office also ringing out at the coffee shop, (so Miss Lilly can assist in answering phones) You will notice that when someone is calling the coffee shop either directly or on the extension it will also ring in the office, it comes thru with a double ring, like a internal line but it says something like VM/FX… on the console and phone displays. Just give the coffee shop a few rings to pick it up if you know Lilly is out there. If not pick it up and be your lovely self..\r\n    Lilly\r\n    Don’t forget when you leave for the day to turn the ringer off in the on the phone in the coffee shop…\r\n    Thanks everyone..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Thank you so much for the inventory of the bag, I went back to Post San Juan and it is now on its way to Germany!\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Please check reservation #1597166 and bag is in Steffi’s office, you are a rockstar! :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 8:56 am\r\n\r\n    DRIP COFFEE…is back inside and will be complimentary as it was before…seems a little weird for guests to have to pay for drip coffee in the morning and then at 3 when Cafe Zia closes, the coffee is free.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2009 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    San Juan Transit came by today and gave us updated schedules. They are the bright yellow schedules, I threw the green ones in the recycling bin. Also, another good thing to know is that Island Tours and Taxi will give guests a tour of the island for $60.00. I placed their cards by the other taxi business cards.\r\n\r\n    Have a great night!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 6:11 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE SCHEDULE\r\n    I had to change the schedule a little. Eliot, Carla, Morgan & Elena, have a look, please.\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    The Java goddess told me is open: 7AM to 3PM.\r\n\r\n    GERMAN BAG\r\n    Carla, I itemized all the content for the bag one of our German guests forgot (great fun), but I can’t find the original return slip anywhere. Can you please follow up on that? Thank you!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE COFFEE\r\n    I ordered coffee for the Wind Place, it should be here later on today or tomorrow. They come in packages of 25.\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    We are working on the gift shop, it is looking great!\r\n\r\n    NEW EARTHBOX SHIRTS\r\n    The new Earthbox shirts are here, WAHOO! Every employee gets 2 shirts, if they would like to purchase more, rip the tag off and put your name on it and place in Cindy’s box.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 4:11 am\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of notes.\r\n\r\n    Coffee is ordered. At least I left a message on their phone. That usually works though. :)\r\n\r\n    I drained and refilled the jacuzzi tonight. It was done close to 3ish so hopefully it will be warm in the morning. The pool had a lot of use from the Bell Ringer kids tonight. I worked on it too so hopefully it will be fine in the morning.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2009 at 7:46 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody, we are out of our Budget Gourmet coffee for the drip coffee. Has a new bag been ordered? Or do I need to call it in today? Let me know!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2009 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    JETTED TUBS\r\n    Please remember, only rooms 301 through 306 have jetted tubs. One of us promised otherwise today. So, 301 through 306 jetted tub, 307 a little larger than the other water places, no jetted tub. All water places in building D: little balcony, but no jetted tub.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Please write all add-on info in the guest remark section, don’t forget to write which provider, what time of the day, which day, how many people and, my favorite: fee added, confirmed, voucher made in there. (See #1645764, Morgan, please go over this with Eliot).\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    Please write confirmation number on room service tickets, so we can double check if the charge has been applied.\r\n\r\n    WESLEY BELL RINGERS\r\n    Will arrive on Sunday. Morgan, please prepare remote check-in and have your spiffy rooming list handy.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. Stefan and I will work the night of the 4th, since we have nothing to be independent about. Morgan is scheduled until 10PM. I promised him he can leave early if it’s possible. Bring us food!\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back. We had such a great time camping on the Nooksack River. I love to be the first camper of the season, a little chilly but the calm you feel sleeping outside to the sound of the river is priceless.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2009 at 2:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey gang! Just wanted to give Morgan a heads up for Saturday morning. I placed a post it note (ok’d by Steffi, ha! ha!) on the back phone console, please set two wake-ups for Sunday. You are a rockstar!:)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2009 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hellllooooo again! I had a busy morning!\r\n\r\n    RACK CARDS\r\n    I organized all the rack cards up at the front desk. I kept the ones that we use the most in the rack holder. Everything else is filed in the top drawer in the black filing cabinet. I made some new folders so you might want to take a peek at it. I also filed them in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n    RATES FOR ROOMS\r\n    Please be sure that you are checking the room rates before editing a reservation. I have had three different reservations that had a changed rate when edited. It is very important that we do not overcharge a guest especially if we have already quoted them a price. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    When opening in the morning, we do not have to make drip coffee for the front desk. Lily will be serving coffee out at Cafe Zia. If Lily is not open for some reason, we will make coffee for the front desk.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2009 at 2:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Earthboxers! What a great day today…it is nice to see Lily again. Cafe Zia is now officially open for service! Just a thing to note: Lily will be having drip coffee out the pool so we no longer are serving it here in the lobby. Have a great night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 16th, 2009 at 10:08 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Graduation everyone… Jacob is officially a high school student! WOW I am not sure I am ready for this..\r\n    Steffi~Morgan had a great time, even my Mom heard about it.. :) You deserve it Morgan, for all your hard work..\r\n    Pool\r\n    Morgan have you heard back on getting the guy here to evaluate our pool/hot tub situation?\r\n    Pool Door\r\n    The new door should be here next week, Seth will install it when it arrives\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Lilly and Cody are officially opening.. YAH… Remind all of our guests at check in about Cafe Zia, we will have muffins, breakfast sandwiches and some other snacks.. Along with coffee of course and fruit smoothies..\r\n    Patio chairs\r\n    Please keep all the chairs organized, if you walk by the sitting area outside 308-311 and the chairs are in disarray, please tidy them.\r\n    Happy Tuesday…\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2009 at 1:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Just want to let everybody know that we have envelopes in the back office which are for the Michaan Wedding. We have to put an envelope in each room before guests check in it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2009 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    NOT SO FAST\r\n    Guys, we had our first “guest selected kayaking online, was charged, nobody booked anything” event of the season (#1661107). No biggy, Stefan handled it like the pro he is. I really hoped we could get away this season without printing out each online reservation. And I still think we can. Just consciously look at the add-on options before you process the reservation, look at it again after you processed it. All good? All good!\r\n    Also: don’t forget to look through upcoming reservations when you have a minute (and we all have a minute during each shift) and look through each reservation’s add-on section. Just be excellent, that’s all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2009 at 5:10 pm\r\n\r\n    HEURISTIC DELIVERY\r\n    Morgan, Elena or Khaili (who else is working that morning shift? ha ha): Tom with Heuristic Enterprises will deliver stuff for Cafe Zia tomorrow. Please put it in Cafe Zia’s freezer immediately.\r\n    311\r\n    is dirty, please let HK know.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2009 at 9:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Great night tonight! Isn’t the weather just beautiful? The beach cruiser bikes were very popular this afternoon. I am on countdown until summer break….only 4 and 1/2 days of school left, wahoo!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2009 at 1:45 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning Khai,\r\n\r\n    I talked with Raquel about the late check-out situation for Sunday Marathoners. She says that she is ok with a 1pm check-out if people request it. She would, of course, prefer an earlier time but if people need until 1 it’s ok. Just let her know. What she would also like you to do is to make sure you keep her posted with what rooms have checked out. That way she can get the housekeepers going. Just call her cell. Just so you know, in case anyone asks, I guess there is supposed to be some sort of expo or something after the race in the parking lot here. That’s about all I got. seez ya.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2009 at 10:48 pm\r\n\r\n    That’s it for the night everybody is in. Nothing exciting. 1634239 should stop by tomorrow pls read guest remarks\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2009 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy- When Carla and I were checking people out we noticed that there was a negative balance on the following reservations: 1648540, 1645042. Just wanted to let you know.\r\n    Other than that, all is good :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2009 at 12:19 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing, when you process a payment, under the 2nd option called “TRANSACTION STATUS” section you need to make sure you select process payment, otherwise the payment will not take, after you select that, under the 3rd option “GUEST STATUS” you will need to select process payment again, you will know if you did not select it right under section 2 because 1. when you hit process payment (under section 3)it will take you to a screen that only has an arrow and no detail of the payment 2.a payment will not show on the guests main screen. Please ask me if you have any questions…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2009 at 12:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool Door\r\n    Our pool door is giving up, Seth is going to try and adjust it once more so that it will close on it’s own, but I would still like us to make multiple trips walking to the pool a day to check to make sure that the pool door is closed. We have a new door that is being ordered. I will post when I find out when it will be here.\r\n    WRP\r\n    If you notice anything that isn’t working quite right on the new version of WRP please make sure you email me with what it is and an example so I can pass it a long.\r\n    Mail\r\n    Please try and make a mail trip on Saturdays.\r\n    Please read notes in reservation# 1444709..\r\n    Have a super weekend.. Smile, enjoy and be happy..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hola Stefan,\r\n    please read my email right away. I’ll be there at 12:30. Have a great shift.\r\n\r\n    Happy busy weekend everybody. This should be fun!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 12:18 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT!\r\n\r\n    Yes, it is. Remember to keep your cool during these hot days. Things that can help…keep the windows open, keep a fan on, breathe, drink lots of water, take a break when you can, have a margarita with the guests, ok, maybe not that one, but you get the point…enjoy it!\r\n\r\n    PANDORA.\r\n\r\n    Enjoy Pandora, but please don’t make any new radio stations or edit the existing one without asking me or Adam first. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 9:00 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I put out some more business cards, the extra ones are in your office on the shelf, they are in a white box.\r\n    Air Conditioners\r\n    I really want to make sure that EVERYONE is telling EVERY person making a reservation, if the room they are choosing has A/C or not, remember water places and sun places are the only rooms that do. If we make this VERY clear we will not run into unhappy guests because they did not know about having no AC..\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    stefan Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 8:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow San Juan Florist are going drop off a bouquet for a guest who is checking in tomorrow please make sure that it is in the room. They will give the name with with the bouquet\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 8:14 pm\r\n\r\n    #1602607, #1602612, #1645647\r\n    A group of 8 lovely ladies. The reservations were made for 4 rooms at different times and when they arrived to split the bill it was a little difficult. Couple of things:\r\n    In the future, if somebody wants to add a room, please add it on the existing reservation. If it’s a different room style, please write a note in the guest remark section.\r\n\r\n    Then: their invoices are in my office. Due to all the splitting up, they still owe us a little money, please have a look at the reservation. Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    FRIENDS\r\n    Please don’t have your friends visit you at worrk. If you want (and can) take a 10 min break off property every once in a while, that’s fine, but please don’t have them hang out and visit.\r\n\r\n    BUSINESS CARDS\r\n    We are out. Stefan and I couldn’t find them in the Cedar room. Where do we have more?\r\n\r\n    I love the weather. Thank you, sun!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    I hope you are still loving the sun.. It is so great :)\r\n    I just ordered 6 small refrigerators for the rooms, they will be arriving in the next few weeks. Please let me know when they arrive.\r\n    Happy Wednesday :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2009 at 9:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a roaster today! Lovin’ this sunny weather! :)\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    I made some more spa vouchers but could not figure out to print more pages on the pretty clear paper. We need to do that so we can make more.\r\n\r\n    Hope everyone has a great rest of the week!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2009 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    WALK-INS\r\n    Please remember folks that when you are taking any reservation that you need to at least get their phone number or email address. This is important as people tend to leave things behind in hotel rooms. We can’t always depend on them remembering that they forgot an item. Thank you! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2009 at 7:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning beautiful Sadie!\r\n    Please call M&W Auto first thing in the morning (378-2886) and make a 2 day reservation for #1638511. Have Wendy from M&W come and pick guest up. He would like the cheapest car available around 9AM. He will pay them directly.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Morgan!\r\n    Please go to Post San Juan and send the wallet back (on back desk).\r\n\r\n    ELIOT & KARLITA (we decided on “Karlita”, since we got a “Carla” already)\r\n    Welcome to the team! Glad to have you.\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I gave 312 a sheet pan from the Orca kitchen. Can you please let Raquel know to put it back after the guests check out?\r\n\r\n    MICHAAN WEDDING\r\n    Please read email regarding this wedding.\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    Now I’m confused. Somebody moved the “out of order” sign from the older (not broken, just flips breaker when going into spin cycle) to the newer (not broken) washer. Can one of you ask Regino if he knows what’s happening there, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy first shift Stefan. Happy Monday everybody.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2009 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    will be gone tomorrow, he will try and call\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2009 at 7:24 pm\r\n\r\n    ADA ROOM INQUIRY\r\n    Elena, I forgot to ask Regino for the ADA measurements. Can you please follow up on that on Sunday?\r\n\r\n    AC\r\n    T’is that time of the year. Please get in the habit of telling all our guests that most of our rooms don’t have AC when they make reservations. All rooms in building B & D have AC, but the others don’t.\r\n\r\n    SJI MARINE CENTER – 378-6202 – BY THE CLOCK DOCK\r\n    They rent kayaks and nice easy to steer boats. And they offer catered picnic cruises. The boat costs $80 per hour. A Cyntia’s Of Course catered lunch, brunch or Sushi basket costs between $12 & $15. Sounds like tons of fun.\r\n    They brought us fliers. If we refer somebody, write your name on the flier and give it to the guests. For each Kayak referral we’ll get a free kayak rental. For each catered cruise we’ll get $5, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Very pleasant day, lot’s of walk ins and phone reservations. We have guests from every continent tonight. Thanks to Karla we were able to help a gentleman from Guatemala. And I got to try my rusty French. We could have used Morgan’s Japanese skills, but oh no, Morgan is off island having a life (kidding, you deserve it!). And there was a Lina & Stefan sighting. Yeah! Welcome back you guys. I’m so glad you will be joining us again this season.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2009 at 1:44 pm\r\n\r\n    WALLET\r\n    There is a red wallet with a Post San juan Slip all filled out on the back desk. It was left behind by one of the elderhostelers. Please take to PSJ ASAP.\r\n\r\n    ADA\r\n    We had someone call and inquire today about the height of the toilet and bed in the ADA room. I asked Regino if he could get measurements when he had a minute today. The phone number is on the back desk\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2009 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    The blinds don’t close correctly due to the string being all messed up. Elena, can you please have Regino look at that on Saturday, it’s a stay-over.\r\n\r\n    GUEST LAUNDRY\r\n    The older guest washer flips the breaker when it goes into the spin cycle. I put an “out of order” note on it and have Seth check it out on Monday.\r\n\r\n    Made more pet policy packages. Fairly quiet tonight and so very very gorgeous outside.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2009 at 9:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Wasn’t the weather great today? Everyone needs to bust out their shorts! (Well Morgan has been in them for months already!) :) Pretty quiet night. I did not take the garbage out because there was hardly any and did not want to waste the bags. Hope everyone has a great weekend.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2009 at 8:59 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM 312\r\n    The guests said that the bathroom lights would not turn on at all. I offered to move them to 314 but they said they would be fine. Please offer them a discount at check-out if they seem upset\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2009 at 1:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Vinny’s\r\n    Hey all. Just letting you know that we are now doing dinning vouchers with Vinny’s Italian Restaurant. We will get a voucher record for it in the folder shortly. Please ask Cindy or Morgan if you have any questions but, it shouldn’t be any different that what we’ve done with the other restaurants.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2009 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hope you all had a great Memorial Day Weekend! Wahoo!\r\n\r\n    Morgan – the tea guy did not call. I put your list of teas “that we had plenty of” in my inbox. Do you have an inbox? I could not find it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2009 at 10:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Holy Moly. They kept me running tonight. oi.\r\n    Several things:\r\n    - 325 is blocked out and is going to need a tidy. I had to move them to 109 because she was handicapped and after being in 325 a little while they realized they really needed better access. They do not have a dog so it’s all good.\r\n    - 214 is blocked out because it needs a comforter. 216 spilled water all over theirs and I needed to replace it and didn’t know where to find an extra. I don’t even think we have extras. Do we? Please tell housekeeping that I set the comforter and the green blanket in housekeeping. Thanks.\r\n    - Just a heads up. I am going to work a while on it but, I can’t guarantee the condition of the pool in the morning. For a long time tonight there was WELL OVER the maximum bather-load in there. At one time I counted 28 people in the pool. Children everywhere! Oh the humanity! I tired telling people that they had too many folks in the pool but they just kinda looked at me like I was stupid or they would move but as soon as I got back to the office they were all back in. sigh. Either way, the pool is starting to turn and I will do my best but, I just wanted to warn you just in case I am unable to stop it. Keep your fingers crossed.\r\n    - We really need to get some more pool towels. We churned through ALL of them within 2 hours. Housekeeping even washed them twice today.\r\n\r\n    Khai and Sadie, good luck with check out. Sorry I was not able to prep any Elderhostel stuff. It’s a very small group and several of them are already on the island if not already in the hotel. Be strong.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2009 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy busy morning. Lots of late check outs and early check ins.. SURPRISE :)\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I made an alarm for you for res. 1625004.. this is just a reminder to check on that.\r\n\r\n    If anyone comes across a pink ball in the pool house, please return it to these nice people; 1625966\r\n\r\n    Other than that, not much to pass on. Bikes were very popular today. I can feel summer right around the corner :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2009 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a ride! I felt like Neo in the Matrix, just doing things faster and faster, without loosing my cool (and without the really hot tight leather pants:)\r\n\r\n    FANS\r\n    We will need to provide fans in all the earth places. People were hot tonight and I brought fans to as many as possible.\r\n\r\n    POOL TOWELS\r\n    We ran through every pool towel in the house. I had to put some room towels out for our swimmers. Please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    WRP was funky today. Didn’t keep charges, didn’t adjust invoices after you made changes on the reservation, erased walk in reservations if you forgot to put in the source code, froze up. Really weird. Let’s keep an eye out and tally the problems if they persist.\r\n\r\n    214\r\n    Door doesn’t open. I think it’s just the batteries. Wrote maintenance request and blocked out the room.\r\n\r\n    Other than that no major issues, couple of little things I wrote into the guest reservations. Thank you Morgan for helping me through the mid-day ferry rush. Almost sold out. One more ferry to go. Sleep well, all our wonderful guests and have a fantastic day tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2009 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    OFFICE HOURS\r\n    Starting today our office will be open from 8:00AM to 10:00PM on weekdays and from 8:00AM to 11:00PM on Friday and Saturday. Night people, please adjust your schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please put the American flag up on the lobby building. Also: next Tuesday Cindy will send to down to BR for a couple of hours to train with Debbie, just so you know.\r\n\r\n    This weekend is going to be a biggy. Wonderful weather. It’s going to be great.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2009 at 9:00 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday…\r\n    Seth\r\n    Seth will not be working this weekend, and will have Monday and Tuesday off as well.\r\n    Taxi\r\n    If you have scheduled to have guests picked up at the hotel for a departure, and you have authorized the hotel to pay for it (you authorize it by asking Cindy or Steffi) you must leave a note in the guests profile, and also give the taxi cab driver your name.\r\n    Payroll\r\n    Oh My, I almost didn’t have the paychecks done today, I lost a week (when I was out of town) and forgot (I don’t know how) that today was the day, so please thank Steffi for reminding me:) THANK YOU THANK YOU STEFFI….\r\n    Kate is here, she is our first student that has arrived for the summer, she is from Moldova, please welcome her and give her all your local islander hints..\r\n    Parking\r\n    It is the time, everyone must park there cars up by building A or on the street. (unless you know for sure when are not busy)\r\n    Happy Memorial weekend to everyone..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 1:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!\r\n\r\n    Sooo we’ve solved the mystery of who’s luggage is to be delivered to us tomorrow. I spoke with a woman from British Airways today who had no clue of who’s luggage was being shipped or why it was being shipped to our address. SO we discovered that it was our new employee, Kate’s luggage. Mystery solved. Apparently, her luggage should arrive on flight #6340 with Kenmore Air around 1:00PM? We do need to make sure Regino goes to pick up the luggage since they do not deliver.\r\n\r\n    Oh, and such a gorgeous day outside! It’s so nice to have the door open and a breeze flowing through the lobby.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 8:42 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Morgan….\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 8:29 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday, Morgan!!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2009 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    I just refunded those guests. Everything is good to go :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2009 at 1:31 am\r\n\r\n    Well I just got woken up by some guy pounding on the lobby door. Upon coming down to speak with him he complains to me that he can’t get in to the room he rented. He proceeds to show me his keycard as proof he has a room. It’s a Best Western card. I sent him on his way and he was very apologetic. You know you’re drunk when not only can you not work your door lock, you are attempting to open a door at a completely different hotel. Just thought I would warn you Khaili in case you have some guest wanting to feed you some horror story about someone trying to break into their room. I only hope he was trying to get into an unoccupied room. *sigh*\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2009 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Khai\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of thing you will need to take care of. I had some problems with a couple of guests. As part of resolving those problems we settled on refunding a bit of there room. Obviously you can’t refund the same day so if you would, could you do it? I am sure these folks will be asking for updated copies of their invoices. Reservation #’s 1614434 & 1615805 just need the amounts shown refunded. Thanks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2009 at 6:36 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    Tomorrow between 9AM and noon a tech from Centurytel will be here and fix our guest computer modem. If for some reason Chris is not around, please call him. Guest computer works for now kind ofish.\r\n\r\n    MAIL\r\n    Please go and pick up the mail tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Dude, it was busy today. The phones were ringing like it was 1993 (what?).\r\n\r\n    HALF ASLEEP IN FROG PAJAMAS\r\n    When we went down to Seattle last, Daniel said: “Let’s stop by La Connor and see Tom Robbins (he lives there). So we went and right as we were looking for a parking space there he was. Tom Robbins. How cool is that? So then in Seattle, when I woke up on the air mattress of my friend the next day I saw this book on her book shelf “Half asleep in frog pajamas” by Tom Robbins. Read all his books, didn’t know that one. He wrote it in 1995 (what is it with the 90ties today, Steff?) and it’s about a female Filipino stock broker in Seattle, who deals with the fall out of the stock market crash back then. She also deals with a 300 pound psychic and the disappearance of her boyfriend’s jewelry stealing monkey (well, you know Tom). This is a fantastic book, could have been written yesterday, like a roller coaster ride. If you need a fun read, this is your book.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2009 at 8:32 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    will not go online. Left message with Chris. Please follow up with him. Many guests are interested in using it.\r\n\r\n    Happy rainy day everybody.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2009 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUP BOOKINGS\r\n\r\n    We will have some guests who already have reservations calling in over the next few weeks to add their reservations into an existing wedding group for August 7/8. If you don’t know how to link existing reservations into an existing group, just ask!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2009 at 3:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all. Couple of things.\r\n\r\n    *Victoria Clipper*\r\n    Please make sure you check the Vic Clip block release emails. Even though the boat isn’t running they are still booking trips. I found a reservation from Saturday that wasn’t made. Please do not delete the block emails. Just hit reply to them with any pertinent info added and move the emails to the “Clipper” folder in Outlook.\r\n\r\n    *Angevine Middle School*\r\n    1 – All the kids filled out paperwork for the bikes and Mike Medina has signed off on the stack of them. The kids can now check out bikes. They must wear their helmet. Let Mike know if any kids are seen riding around without one.\r\n    2 – Mike has requested to get a van run for the kids out to the Labs on Thursday the 14th. It will probably take 2 trips and they need it around 2:45. I hope that will be ok. Perhaps Regino or Seth could do it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2009 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    What a great Fiesta we had. Thank you so much, Laura, Adam, Cindy, Raquel & Regino for making this happen.\r\n\r\n    Elena & Khaili, Sunday Goddesses, please read the emails. Couple of things you’ll need to know about.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Carla, for making vouchers. And yes, Elena & Khaili, please make some more.\r\n\r\n    Happy Mother’s Day all you brave women in my life who raised and keep raising wonderful kids. You have all my respect. And I hope all your rascals are spoiling you rotten tomorrow!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2009 at 12:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy sunny saturday everyone! Can’t wait for the party tonight! Yummy! Wanted to let you know that I made a bunch of vouchers, we still need more made, it is that time of year!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2009 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Tamales are made, pig is dead, margarita mix is bought, Let’s party! I can’t wait.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2009 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday:)\r\n    Ivan from Western Prince would like to take us all on a excursion in the next few weeks on their new boat. Here is the description:\r\n\r\n    WESTERN EXPLORER\r\n\r\n    New for 2009, the “Western Explorer” is a 27′ Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat, similar to the boats the Coast Guard uses for search and rescue. It is the only US Coast Guard certified Rigid Hull Inflatable in Washington State. The “Western Explorer” seats 15 guests and cruises at up to 30 knots, getting us where we need to go quickly. To ensure your comfort, every guest receives a full length Coast Guard approved anti-exposure suit.\r\n\r\n    Can any of you employees make it for a trip on the afternoon of the 27th? If note let me know which date that week would work for you.\r\n\r\n    PARTY PARTY\r\n    Don’t forget tomorrow is our annual party.. YUMMY.. 4-7pm… see you all there.\r\n\r\n    Dishes\r\n    Please if you are on shift and you see there are dishes in the sink, and you are not busy, please wash them..\r\n    Don’t forget to vacuum it can always be done, in the lobby and behind the desk.\r\n\r\n    Brian from SJI Outfitters was going to do a kayak demonstration tomorrow during the party, he has hurt his back and may not be able to do it, BUT he is still going to be here and will have a drawing for a free kayak trip.\r\n\r\n    Savage Roofing was here. Anyone interested can ask me what the end result was.\r\n\r\n    Have a GREAT weekend…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2009 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    DIRECT BILLS\r\n    Just a reminder to all, including myself, that when we do a direct bill we need to put the signed copy of the invoice in Cindy’s in-box. That way she know to send out the bill. THANKS!!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2009 at 10:01 am\r\n\r\n    Hello all……\r\n    On Saturday around 10 or 11 am Paul Hopkins is going to come and set the tent up for the party.\r\n    Have you noticed the BEAUTIFUL cherry trees in full bloom…\r\n    They are spectacular.\r\n    Keep up all the wonderful work everyone…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2009 at 8:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Everything went smoothly this evening. I did the remote check in for the group tomorrow. They are lined up on the back desk. Oookay, that’s all. See you soon :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2009 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday, Cindy!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2009 at 4:57 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Morgan, can you please go to the bank on Monday and get us some change?\r\n\r\n    SUSIE’S MOPED\r\n    Morning Gods & Goddesses, please don’t forget to put Susie’s Moped on display outside the pool patio each morning and securely tuck it away each night. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Got some walk-ins today. Thank you, spontaneous people!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2009 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey strangers!\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    I miss you. See you next week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2009 at 8:34 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ\r\n    I didn’t hear back about the Unirez reservations that may or may not be duplicates.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    They will come by tomorrow for the check that is on the back desk.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2009 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Gift Shop\r\n    Whew… Took most of the night but I finally got everything priced and put out. All excess magnets are enclosed inside the small magnet display. All other extra items like books, playing cards, and ornaments are in the small box under the back desk. Hope that’s good.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2009 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    PET ROOMS\r\n    NEW AND OLD POLICY\r\n    Poor dogs they were lonely:(\r\n    Please make sure at check in that ALL guests know that dogs are not to be left unattended in the room. This has been our policy for as long as I remember but I don’t think it has been followed as strict as it should.\r\n    All pet rooms MUST have a pet registration filled out, and NOW on it will be a local contact number just in case someone decides to leave their lonely little pets unattended..\r\n    MORGAN~please revise the pet policy today, and put together some more pet packets.\r\n    312\r\n    Opalco is going to put a nifty little device on this room so we can try and locate where in the world the power is tripping out at, so please DO NOT touch anything in that room, once the device is in place I will turn the heater and lights on so hopefully it will cause the issue to happen again.\r\n    Enjoy ALL the sunshine… you never know it might snow tomorrow:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2009 at 12:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Pet Rooms\r\n    Ok folks. I don’t know about you all but I think from now on we need to make sure we have the cell phone number of anyone staying in a pet room. I got called several times last night because a guest’s dogs were constantly barking. The guest was not in the room and the only phone number I had for them wasn’t their cell. These dogs barked for several hours before the guests finally came back. Let me know what you think. Should we make this a policy? Thanks!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2009 at 12:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Pretty busy this morning. Reservation #1563253 left her watch. I have talked with her, and she is going to have her friend pick it up by the end of the week. She will be asking for it by name. The watch is in the safe in the envelope with both guest name on it. 4/18/2009 cm\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2009 at 2:38 pm\r\n\r\n    We have some great tickets to give a way to our guest that will be with us on Sunday evening. Please ask the EB front desk if you have a guest that is interested. The showing is a tribute to Roy Orbison, there are 2 showings one at 4pm and one at 7pm, both showings are at the SJC Theatre. Be sure to offer them to guests who will be here. Thanks everyone have a good weekend. :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 16th, 2009 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Spring everyone! Just wanted to let you know that reservation #1528458 has borrowed the scrabble game and they will bring it back in the morning. San Juan Safaris also called to remind us that our staff can join them on their whale watching tour tomorrow at 1:00, just call them in the morning so they know who is coming.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2009 at 1:04 pm\r\n\r\n    THE FUTURE\r\n    I updated the event calendar on our website through June. Check it out, lot’s of stuff going on for the centennial celebration, cool tours and lectures. Be informed and let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    #1561268\r\n    Has a cash deposit in the safe. Please have Raquel check the rooms when they check out, before you give the deposit back.\r\n\r\n    UPGRADE\r\n    Please remember to upgrade our guests whenever we are not too busy.\r\n\r\n    Wonderful day, lot’s of walk-ins & bike check outs. We have to have Seth do a bike maintenance day next week (wrote slip).\r\n    Welcome home Laura & Adam, it’s good to have you back!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Nice and quiet night here on Earth. I do like the new location of the key maker so much. Thank you, Seth!\r\n\r\n    ERROR MESSAGE\r\n    I get an error message every time I click on the EB website. Does anybody else have that problem? I’ll contact Blizzard tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2009 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Seth is our hero….. He built a nifty little pull out draw at the front desk for a key card machine, the keys fit right behind it so now, we don’t have to turn our backs to our customers. Thank you Seth….\r\n    Mail: If you are the morning person on Saturdays and you see mail that needs to be put in the outgoing mail before Saturday afternoon, please bring it to the post office. Thanks..\r\n    We are all inspected, passed with flying colors.. HURRAAAAY..\r\n    Happy Thursday..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2009 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Just an FYI, if Robin’s Nest calls. They sent us an invoice for flowers we ordered. At the top they just said “Valentines Flowers.” I left a message w/ Robin’s Nest asking them to let us know if they have the names or at least the reservation numbers for the rooms we ordered the flowers for. The invoice is in the top inbox on Cindy’s desk. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2009 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a heads up for the 4/8 morning crew. Just got a call from the state inspector and he will be up in the morning to do he usual “every 2 year” boiler and water tank inspection. He said that he would want the maintenance guy to show him around so I have already warned Seth. Please give Seth a call when the inspector arrives. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2009 at 4:47 pm\r\n\r\n    DUCK SOUP\r\n    Well woohoo! Duck Soup has reopened a little early for the season. Through April they will be open for dinner Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. In May they will add Thursday to the line up. Keep in mind they will not be open for dinner on April 12th and May 10th. Those days they are serving brunch in honor of Easter and Mothers Day respectively.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2009 at 7:39 pm\r\n\r\n    WIFI PASSWORD\r\n    Please do not ever give our wifi password out to people who aren’t our guests.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE ROOM\r\n    Regino will shampoo the carpet in the exercise room on Monday night. He will come around 9PM, so it will be dry the next morning.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Their big boat is in the shop, but they will take their new and exciting zodiac out at noon and 3PM over the weekend. The zodiac is big enough for 15 passengers and looks like fun, fun, fun.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, weather, for being wonderful some more. Lot’s of smiling, happy people checking in.\r\n    Happy Birthday Zoe, fellow Aries, have a fantastic day!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2009 at 8:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! The TV in the Wind Place is broken so I took a TV from 115. (A big thanks to Seth, who came in and hauled it up to the house!). I did not know how to block out room 115. The pool was busy this evening, lots of kids tonight! It looks like the rain is finally going away. I am so ready for some warmer weather!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2009 at 8:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone! All is well tonight. I think we may be out of hot chocolate. Brian from San Juan Outfitters dropped off his rates and schedule for Summer 2009. He has a great new paddle boat that can be rented, it looks so cool! He is also renting stand-up paddle boards! Check it out! Tomorrow is April Fools Day, watch out!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 30th, 2009 at 10:55 am\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone-\r\n    I blocked out 311 for a week and filled out a maintenance request as per Raquel. She said the left side of the bed frame is broken\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2009 at 1:23 pm\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    I talked for a long time with Ivan last night about the oddity that everybody charges $75 per person for a whale watch trip this season, but Western Prince charges $76, why, why, why?\r\n    Western Prince gives 4% of their profits to salmon restoration organizations. No salmon – no whales – no whale watch tours – no visitors, get it? He said, he thinks he owes that to our environment. I loved him for that.\r\n    So, having said all that, he doesn’t want us to go through the trouble of manually changing the whale watch price every time we book with him. We can just leave it at $75.\r\n    Western Prince goes out daily at noon.\r\n\r\n    ADVENTURE VOUCHERS\r\n    I’m almost done updating our adventure vouchers for the season. I simplified them some, easier to read, cleaner looking. What do you think?\r\n\r\n    FERRY SCHEDULE\r\n    New ferry schedule will be in effect tomorrow. I’ll bring schedules up later today.\r\n\r\n    Dude, it snowed at my house this morning. How does that go, March comes in like a lion goes out like an ice bear?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2009 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    MAINTENANCE LOG\r\n    Cindy & I want to keep a log of completed maintenance tasks. Laura created a log on my computer (desktop). Seth will input the maintenance slips upon completion.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL EARLY ARRIVALS\r\n    When taking a reservation for Elderhostel guests arriving early or staying after their program, please print out their reservation and put it in the “Elderhostel early arrival” folder next to my computer. Morgan and I will make sure the guests stay in the same room, once we get the rooming list from EH. Thank you for letting us know, Laura:)\r\n\r\n    YOGA VOUCHER\r\n    Adam is creating a new and exciting special soon, involving yoga class add-ons to reservations. New yoga vouchers are in the voucher file with the other current adventure vouchers. Stay tuned for more info!\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Will have a sailing this Saturday at 1PM and will start to go out on th weekends at noon.\r\n\r\n    ISLAND CULINARY TOURS\r\n    Naoni from Hillside B&B is offering culinary tours this season. There is a 2 hour walking tour for $35 touring local restaurants, bakeries, delis and specialty food shops. And also a 3 hour shuttle bus tour for $50 visiting local farms. Flyers are under white board. She offers a free shuttle tour to farms on 4/3 from 1-4 and a walking tour on 4/4 from 10-noon for us tourist industry professionals. Call her to sign up: 378-4730\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPRING SPRING\r\n    The hummingbirds are back. I planted vegetables. The flowers are blooming. Finally. Man, this was a long Winter.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2009 at 5:07 pm\r\n\r\n    JAN VAN:\r\n\r\n    My mom’s green toyota van is parked in the back. If you need to move it for any reason, the keys are on my desk.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2009 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINE\r\n    Woo hoo, it looks like it might finally get fixed by next Tuesday or Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Morgan or Cindy or Steffi or whoever does the room assignments these days…I took a reservation (1533861)for some folks coming in on the May 25 trip. They will be arriving on the 20th and I put them in a Sky place. Any chance they can stay in that room for the duration?\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 8:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday everyone! This is going to be a great week! Cindy, I left a note on your desk. I did all the reservations for the month of April. Whew! That is a task! Hope you all have a great week and I will back on Saturday.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Just an FYI~\r\n    When you are booking a whale watch, the price that is in the system is good for all operators except for Western Prince they are $76.00 per person instead of $75.00. So if you choose to book with them remember to increase the rate in the reservation you are making.. Please leave the default rate as it is though.\r\n    PLEASE PLEASE, I am also reminding you, mark rooms as clean when you get the housekeeping report.. More often then not the rooms have not been marked clean, when I come in in the morning.. That is something the afternoon shift should do, when they get here, verify what is clean and mark it clean. (I have to say though that Morgan you are super good doing this.. Thanks)\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 12:45 pm\r\n\r\n    So you know if I’m taking the time to post something on the blog, I must find it important (witness the previous post):\r\n\r\n    Please, pretty please, don’t forget to mark rooms clean when you get the list from housekeeping.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 12:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Steffi!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 10:01 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEFFI……\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY MONDAY… Our blog is getting lonely:(\r\n    Have a great week everyone..\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    swim suit\r\n    There is a swim suit on the chair in Cindy’s office with a Post San Juan slip all filled out. The guest would like it shipped out tomorrow if possible\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2009 at 4:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest 1506947 called because she left her bathing suit in the room. Regino brought up a black bikini with polka dots on it. I left msg with guest. I didn’t get her mailing address. See notes for more info.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2009 at 9:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys. Happy Monday. I think I left a brush in the pool room on Saturday. If found, can you please put it on my desk. Thanks!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone\r\n    It’s been a while. Anyways, there was a laptop charger left in the room under res #1458017. It is on the back desk, please try and call them. I called this evening and left a message for them. Res #1506947 thinks they left their bathing suit. I went and looked in housekeeping but didn’t see anything. Please check with housekeeping in the morning.\r\n    Wish for sun for me :) The rain and snow has saturated our softball field and we need it to dry up so we can practice outside, instead of in the gym. Speaking of softball, we have our first home game on Friday at 4:30 up at the elementary school field. We also have a double header here on Saturday. You all should stop by!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2009 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Gorgeous Carla!\r\n    The conference center is all set up. Please make sure to let Raquel know to turn the heat up and maybe provide some space heaters.\r\n    Also: please have Raquel tidy 314. The guests checked in, but were expecting 2 separate bedrooms and checked back out. thank you.\r\n    Have a great shift!\r\n\r\n    Morgan, world traveler!\r\n    I hope you had fun in Seattle. I have a little job for you on Wednesday, 3/18: we have a small order which we need to pick up from the food co-op (nothing which needs fridgeration, just 4 gallons of personal care products & granola). I gave them your number. They’ll call you when the order comes in. Will you please get a check from Cindy, pick up the order and drop it off at Bird Rock? Thank you, Thank you!\r\n\r\n    Also: where is the front desk phone charger, anybody?\r\n\r\n    Miss you all:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2009 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    We have a memorial service in the conference center this Saturday. Carla, I made a key to the room, it’s in the little magnetic key basket.\r\n    Please, when reserving the conference center, always asked:\r\n    1) From when to when the event will take place (what if guests arrive before we open the office?)\r\n    2) how the room shall be set up (let Raquel know a couple of days in advance)\r\n    3) what the event is\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2009 at 8:56 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, brrrrrr! It is cold outside. All went well this evening! Hope you all have a great week, I will see you this weekend! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2009 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Had to revise the schedule once more. Please have a look. Thank you all for working so hard and bearing with us.\r\n    Much love\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2009 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday everyone.. WOW the weather is beautiful, and the crocus are blooming in the garden.. Spring is coming..\r\n    cindy Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2009 at 2:44 pm\r\n\r\n    I am testing..\r\n    TechieChris Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2009 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy EarthBox People! I revamped the WiFi login and changed the password. Make sure to check the printed invoice for the new password, or ask Morgan or Cindy! The new password is effective NOW!\r\n\r\n    Cheers!\r\n\r\n    Chris\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 11:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy busy busy!\r\n\r\n    305’s heater is broken. Maintenance request filled out. I blocked it out until tuesday. I moved these guys to 203.\r\n\r\n    306’s toilet needs checked on. It is leaking and doesn’t like to flush. Maintenance requested filled out. I also blocked this room until Tuesday. Morgan, make sure you don’t book anyone in this room tomorrow because it wouldn’t let me block it out since there is going to be someone in there until check out.\r\n\r\n    Happy Valentines, everyone\r\n    ♥\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 12:53 pm\r\n\r\n    OK. Due to a guest bringing a pet unannounced 203 is now the hold room. *whew*\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    Crisis semi-averted. 335 called to cancel so we now have that as a hold room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 9:21 am\r\n\r\n    218 is no longer a hold room. Somehow it got unblocked (or something) and it was booked online in the middle of the night. We do NOT have any emergency hold rooms. I will talk to housekeeping about the status of 109. I don’t know what happened.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 8:37 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TO ALL OF YOU!\r\n    Laura, Adam and I bought you all a box of yummy chocolates to share, they are from SJ Florist, who is now making home made chocolates.. Enjoy.. Thank you for all you all do..\r\n    We all completely sold out, except for 218, which is a hold room in case of an emergency.. Khaili, you may sell it after 6PM if you can..\r\n    Morgan, if you have time this morning, please put all voucher in envelopes with a foiled chocolate heart on the outside (like I did yesterday) to make it extra special..\r\n    REMEMBER all of you to spread the VALENTINE CHEER, (even if you don’t feel it) A LOT of people went the EXTRA mile to make a special night for their sweeties..\r\n    All the bikes are back on the property, remember to keep them locked up at night and during the day. If it looks like it will rain tonight put them inside the pool fence, under the cover (at least as many as you can).\r\n    NO ROOM SERVICE FROM: Back Door Kitchen is closed but they will reopen on the 19th of Feb.\r\n    311 had a bit of a leak in the room, Seth tried to fix it by caulking on the roof above and vacuuming where the slow leak was coming through the ceiling inside the room, the guests where totally fine with it, it was not a big deal and was a really slow drip.. Hopefully it has a TEMP fix for now..\r\n    Remember to pass out the word, we would love for guests to post on Trip Advisor.. When they get ready to leave at check in, say: Once you get into your room please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.\r\n    Happy Day.. Enjoy…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 12th, 2009 at 7:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Alright, Sweethearts, this weekend is going to be a big one!\r\n    We are almost sold out. Be excellent and kind; I know you always are:)\r\n\r\n    209\r\n    We have a check in in 209 tomorrow (Friday). I opened it without Raquel’s o.k. Please make sure it’s ready.\r\n\r\n    YES, WE CAN\r\n    Please know that guests interested in a multiple night stay may book this. Simply open an earth place for Friday or Sunday respectively.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS & THINGS\r\n    Cindy and I were the voucher making queens today. I went through all reservations and made sure we have all vouchers. I brought some more trays and champagne buckets from BR. Morgan, please double check all vouchers again tomorrow, just to be on the safe side. A list of upcoming romance packages is on the white board.\r\n\r\n    RESTAURANTS\r\n    As of right now, The Place and Vinny’s still have seatings for Valentine’s night early (like 4ish) and late (after 8).\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCH\r\n    Brian at SJO has 6 spots left on his cruise on 2/14, 11:45AM out of Roche.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Our spa is booked 2/14, has one opening on Sunday 2/15 at 5:15. Spa d’Bune still has spots for this weekend.\r\n\r\n    WORKING OUT\r\n    Cindy brought flyers (spelling?) for the new fitness center on Beaverton Valley. They have day passes for $10. The flyers are next to our white board.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY\r\n    Morgan will open, Elena will be there with him noon to 3. Morgan will stay through the 3:35 ferry with Khaili. Khaili will be the night goddess. Please bring towels, shampoo, heaters and everything else you think Khaili will need at night into our office, so she doesn’t have to leave if a guest needs something.\r\n\r\n    I’m at BR at all hours of the day. Call me if you need something.\r\n    We can do this! Go team Earthbox!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2009 at 9:00 pm\r\n\r\n    334\r\n    is dirty. I moved the guest into a different room. Please make sure this gets cleaned tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    118\r\n    Can be rented on Valentine’s weekend if we need an additional pet room. Please note, the room only has a small TV. Please let potential guests know.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    will re-open on 2/19/09. They will be open for dinner Wednesday through Sunday and will serve Noddle Bowl Lunch on Mondays. We got to go check that out, yum, noodle bowl.\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    I left a message with Barry’s Insulation, re: cc authorization, waiting to get their fax number.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 8th, 2009 at 2:20 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    We are starting to get reservations and adventure/massage requests for the summer (yippieh ya ye). I would like us to start including the arrival date when we create an alarm, as in: book massage for 7/31/09 arrival. We would set an alarm like that for the beginning of July, but then, when we glance at the alarms in a hurry, we know, we don’t have to deal with booking this right this moment. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\n    BLANKET\r\n    The guest who lost her blanket called back, all set to go to Post San Juan tomorrow. Morgan, she is so grateful that you strolled through town, found the blanket on a park bench, called and made sure it’s hers. Your effort really meant a lot to her and she wanted you to know that. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2009 at 10:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Steffi-\r\n    The Rack cards are on Cindy’s computer. They are placeholders until we get the real thing…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2009 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN & KHAILI\r\n    Please make some more spa vouchers. Then go through the Valentine’s weekend reservation and make sure all the vouchers are made.\r\n    We will be busy, yeah, yippieh, yuchu!\r\n\r\n    I love our new rack cards. On who’s computer are they?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2009 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    Just an update, I have opened 301-307 for Valentines weekend, Raquel will be working on getting them ready.. Sell away..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2009 at 5:43 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    We had to make some schedule changes and the schedule for Valentine’s week is up. Thank you all for your flexibility these days, we appreciate it!\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHING\r\n    Whale watch tour prices will go up to $75 (SJS)/$76 (WP) per adult this summer. I switched the prices in WRP. Morgan, will you start updating our vouchers accordingly, please?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2009 at 5:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Steve from SJ Coffee, fixed the espresso machine.. YAH\r\n    Also he adjusted our drip coffee maker and said he should no longer be making bitter coffee.. HURRAY…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 28th, 2009 at 9:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everybody,\r\n\r\n    CHAMPAGNE\r\n    I ordered 2 cases (one for each hotel) from Market Chef for the big Love & Presidents Fest coming up. Please let me know when they call.\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    lacks internet. I tried to call Chris, but only got a busy signal. Please try to call him again.\r\n\r\n    332 & 336\r\n    are all repaired and clean and ready to go. Yeah Team Earthbox!\r\n\r\n    # 1445612 at Bird Rock is all taken care of. Thanks Khaili.\r\n\r\n    Super deep thought of the day:\r\n    History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 28th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Dell order: I ordered a toner cartridge for Adam’s printer so if it comes in, please just set it on my desk.\r\n\r\n    Great review: I want to congratulate all of you for the great review you received on Trip Advisor. Nice work!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2009 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone.\r\n    It was a relatively busy night. I have three walk-ins! Yay! :)\r\n\r\n    Anyways, I got an e-mail from the call center about Reservation # 1445612 for Bird Rock. He didn’t want his room to be canceled and he wanted me to call him so he could keep the room. I called but it rang and rang and rang. I recommend reading the e-mail and his reservation notes so this makes more sense. Sounds a little sketchy to me…\r\n    Well, I’m headed home. I’m not scheduled for a while, but I’m sure I will be around.\r\n    See you all soon!\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 23rd, 2009 at 7:51 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Will you please have a look at the new booking section. There is an alarm and a new booking needing your attention.\r\n    Thanks for the new cool phone list. I added the Bird Rock emergency phone number:)\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Work-out queen and little brother watcher! Can you go through our “made voucher” folder and throw out vouchers for treatments and ad-ons, which didn’t take place, please?\r\n    Also: will you vacuum the lobby by the end of your shift, please?\r\n\r\n    Steve from San Juan Coffee worked on both, our coffee maker and the espresso machine. Our coffee maker has some weird adjustment issue (wants to live in the tropics?), that’s why the coffee is a little bitter. He is working on it. And he may know what part we need for the espresso maker. To be continued…\r\n\r\n    I’ll work a double at Bird Rock. I may have to go home for a half an hour and may utilize one of you to take the BR phone during that time.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 22nd, 2009 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of little things:\r\n    I had 3 walk-ins, hoot, hoot, yippieh!\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    is blocked out for a couple of days. Seth caulked the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you please take all the Christmas deco staples off the office walls (around fire place, along trim, etc.). Also: can you please vacuum pool & hot tub. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    INTERESTING FACT\r\n    Did you know, that when tested, all but Italian and Australian wines had very high levels of heavy metals in them? I knew I liked my Sangiovese for a good reason.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 20th, 2009 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    I have added a new group folio please check out the notes in group name: NWSDB\r\n    Morgan & Steffi (actually all closing people) during this cold time, let’s keep the office thermostat at 60 when you close at night.\r\n    Vacuum: Please remember to empty the canister when you use the vacuum.\r\n    Morgan: please finish the phone list, make sure you add any new phone numbers on.\r\n    Morgan: Reservation #1448317 needs a call about the massage they would like, please see their reservation in BR.\r\n    Remember to vacuum and dust when you are the closing person. There is SO much time it shouldn’t be a problem..\r\n    Thanks everyone.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 20th, 2009 at 1:33 am\r\n\r\n    The no show finally came in. He’ll be coming in for his receipt in the morning. I didn’t want to wait around for the computer to fire up.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 19th, 2009 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    G’mornin! Just a couple of quick things:\r\n\r\n    1 – #1429654 is a no-show at closing.\r\n\r\n    2 – Cindy, apparently I don’t have the power to turn off those Unirez alarms on the BR WRP. I have emailed Kyle though so hopefully it will be resolved.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 16th, 2009 at 11:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everybody,\r\n    It’s good to be back. Nice and busy the last couple of days, lot’s of reservations. Yeah! Maybe we get some walk-ins with the weather being so sweet.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 16th, 2009 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, the 2 weeks have gone by FAST… Welcome back everyone… Here are a few things to get you started..\r\n    1. Dept of Health (shell fish & water dept) will be making reservations they will be honored the per diem rate.. Ask me for questions.. This will be honored Sept 30 thru April 1..\r\n    2. Rack Cards and Business Cards: Business cards will be here by the end of the month, and the rack cards should be done in 30 -45 days (hopefully sooner, I will know more on Wednesday) If someone needs paper information please see Steffi or I.\r\n    3. There is a leak issue (not currently happening but did during the snow period) Savage Roofing will be stopping by to check it out.\r\n    4. Seth will be in on Monday 1-19-08\r\n    5. Tory will be back on the island around the 29th of Jan.\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend, and welcome back everyone..\r\n    Cindy :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 5th, 2009 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Jan 5, 2000\r\n    It is so quite in here :( Laura and Adam and I are like quiet little mice.. Working away.. Happy 2009 everyone.. I miss you all and we will see some of you on the 16th of Jan..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 31st, 2008 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hellloooo Earthbox Staff! I just wanted to wish everyone a very HAPPY NEW YEAR! Can you believe we are going into 2009? My how time flies! All was quiet here at the front desk today. I guess the next time I will be in here, the Christmas tree will be down….boo-hoo….it looks so pretty. This is my last shift for winter break. Thank you for letting me help out, and I will see all of ya in the summer! :) HAPPY 2009!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 29th, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Cindy will put out the paychecks on Thursday, 1/1/09. I will be in the office 9AM to noon. Come and get ‘em! Please don’t deposit before Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2008 at 3:03 pm\r\n\r\n    FERRY FOR FREE SPECIAL\r\n    We have a new special. See the email I wrote or check out http://www.guidetosanjuans.com/index.cfm?action=sji for more details.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE SHOP PIPE\r\n    Seth checked out the broken pipe, we won’t need a plumber. He will be able to fix it once the snow is melted.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Morgan, will you be a snow angel and start taking the Back Door Kitchen menus & cover pages for room service (keep those, please) out of all rooms, please? I would like to get this done before our closure. Reminder: Back Door Kitchen will be closed until mid February.\r\n\r\n    I’m out, I’m out, I made it off the mountain, yeah!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 26th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Glad to finally see the rain again (never thought I would say that!) The roads look a lot better, I can see the pavement….yahoo! This morning went great. I cannot believe that Christmas is over already! I hope everyone had a great holiday and I will see all of you next week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2008 at 10:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Forgot to blog…\r\n    Well sorry for the delay in blogging this though I have told Steffi. There was a burst pipe under the coffee shop sink thanks to Morgan who walked by and heard the running water and was then able to shut the water off underneath everything is fine for now but hopefully we can get a plumber on this as soon as Christmas passes\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2008 at 2:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Things are looking up. My phone is working again. D & I dug out the cars yesterday for 2 hours, only to firmly lodge them in the snow on both edges of the driveway. I have such a muscle ache. Well, Chris and Jerry will bring provisions to us later. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    312 is blocked out until further notice, upgraded a reservation to the Wind Place.\r\n\r\n    Please read email regarding a possible 5 night stay 1/15 to 1/20.\r\n\r\n    I miss you guys. Keepme posted.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2008 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Snow snow snow! There is so much of it.. poor Steffi, she can’t even leave home.\r\n    Its been a calm night, nothing exciting to pass on.\r\n    Christmas is only three sleeps away :D\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW! Can you believe all the SNOW! I think it must have snowed another 5 inches overnight! It is so beautiful outside! I had a great morning and all went well. I love all the Christmas decorations that are put up in the lobby….it is so festive in here! I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas! I will see y’all at the end of the week! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2008 at 2:01 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m experiencing technical difficulties. Not only am I snowed in, I also can’t recieve phone calls (my phone doesn’t ring, regardless of which phone I use and where I plug it in). So, Elena will work my shift tonight (thank you, thank you, thank you). We’ll check in tomorrow. My internet is working. Please email me if you need to get a hold of me.\r\n    Cindy and Laura, would you strap liquor, wood and steaks around Roxy’s, Zeus’ and Thor’s neck and send them up here, please?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 9:21 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, 312 is a problem child.. Dave and I were off island so he could not come and check it out right away. Dave will talk to Steffi tomorrow, BUT until we have it fixed we will shut that room down after the party leaves that is in there now. Steffi can you make sure this room gets shut out after Dave comes in. THANKS SO MUCH..\r\n    SNOW SNOW SNOW.. It is so beautiful. I love it. While we were on the mainland today in the midst of all the chaos (believe me it was CRAZY, bumper to bumper traffic from Mount Vernon to Burlington) I am reminded again of what a beautiful peaceful place we live, the chaos is just a ferry ride away when you are in need of it.. But to come back to this quiet laid back place is a real blessing..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    All is good with 312, gave a little discount and keys to 314. These folks are so nice. They come here every Winter.\r\n\r\n    I told a local, Gary is his name, he could use our pool for $5 per person tomorrow. He knows this is an exception and not something we offer when it’s summer.\r\n\r\n    I went to the Farmer’s market this morning. Man, no produce whatsoever, everything is frozen. But I got some delicious ravioli from the new San Juan Pasta Company, so yummy.\r\n\r\n    This storm tonight will be brutal. Stay warm, be kind, check on your friends and neighbors and call if you need something.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I took care of most everything this morning. They didn’t want to move. I got them a couple of extra luggage racks a new alarm clock. BUT THEN… They realized that their bathtub was not draining so I had Regino go in. He tried everything plunged it, pulled tons of hair our of it with a wire and ran some Drano but didn’t have any luck so, I stuck a note on their door explaining the problem and offered to have them either move to 314 just next door or open the adjoining doors so that they don’t have to move but can use the bathroom in 314.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 1:48 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Good morning Elena. I just need to let you know something for tomorrow. The folks in 312 will be moving to the Wind place for the duration of their stay. 312 started having a weird electrical problem. For safety’s sake they wanted out of the room but they needed something with a kitchen. Since the Wind place has been unoccupied for the last several weeks; it was their idea to wait until Sat to move in. I went in and turned on all the heaters in the place tonight so it would warm up for them. I don’t know if he is going to be wanting a deal or anything but feel him out when he comes in to get the keys. You also need to call Dave in the morning to let him know about the electrical problem. Apparently the power went off briefly to the bed side of the room and that the lights in the bathroom and by the beds were dimming in relation to the thermostat setting. Strangely enough the lights dimmed when he turned down the thermostat then stayed dim. The power flickered out then came back on in full a few moments later. The guest is concerned about a possible short, thus prompting the move. Sorry you have to deal with this. Please let them know that the house is set up as two kings. They have three adults and a child so they should be ok. I just hope it’s warm enough in there by tomorrow morning. Please call me if you have any questions. Laters.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2008 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Will close for the season the day after tomorrow. They will open again mid February. So no more room service for our guests until then.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Will be closed until Monday 12/22 at 1PM. Guests, front line & staff is informed. Please check BR’s WRP. Thank you guys.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 17th, 2008 at 12:50 pm\r\n\r\n    MERRY CHRISTMAS!\r\n    I’m so sorry that we had to cancel the Christmas party. I was looking forward to some holiday cheer with all my crazy cohorts. In the absence of that, Adam and I have given you each a little card which is in your box.\r\n    Here’s hoping for a white Christmas…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 15th, 2008 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    STORM SPECIAL\r\n    As per Laura we are offering rooms for $50 plus tax to islanders affected by the cold snap (power outage, frozen water pipes, tree fell on house, etc.)\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ UPDATE ERROR ALARM\r\n    As per WRP the above mentioned alarms occur due to the new WRP interface and have probably to do with Unirez trying to update availability during our January closure. Please turn those alarms off as they occur.\r\n\r\n    Stay warm, be kind and jolly.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 15th, 2008 at 3:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Monday Morning:) I hope everyone is staying warm..\r\n    A few things:\r\n    I had a phone call this morning from the Lisa who works at the Blair House, they have some international students staying with them who go to Spring Street school, they have time restrictions on how late the students may go on the internet and she said they have been logging on to our wireless after their normal hours that they are allowed to use the internet at Blair House. So with all that, we are changing our password. Please make sure that if someone calls for the password, that they are calling from a room, and if they are not, ask them if you can call them back at their room number, or ask them for their name. This should eliminate the chance that people are just calling for the password acting as though they are one of our guests.\r\n\r\n    Since we are so slow this week, our office hours are shortened, we will decide per day how late we will stay open, if you are the person closing and you leave early don’t forget to call Frontline.\r\n\r\n    Office party\r\n    We are going to try and reschedule the party for January. We will let you know what date, if anyone has any date restrictions please let me know.\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 12th, 2008 at 7:12 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The schedule through January 25 (I kid you not) is up.\r\n    As per Laura we will close early today. Morgan will staff the front desk from 11-7 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    It started to snow on Cady Mountain and Shaw Island is out of power. Oh goody. Stay warm everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2008 at 7:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan!\r\n    Please read email regarding travel writer, she will probably call tomorrow.\r\n    Also: Laura’s father came to visit tonight. He is in 323, scheduled to check into the San Juan tomorrow. Please check with Raquel when the San Juan will be ready for check in. Tory will open BR at 1PM.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2008 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    PARTY\r\n    Yeah! Don’t forget our staff party this Sunday. Bring a snack and a white elephant gift. We gonna have us some fun!\r\n    Elena: please bake a bunch of cookies on your Sunday morning shift for us, will you? Morgan: please haul the galvanized tubs into the office and fill them with ice on Sunday.\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    If Kyle stops by, please tell him we’ll need keys to the file cabinets under Cindy’s computer and the ones next to the bathroom door.\r\n\r\n    BALD EAGLE\r\n    When I drove to work today, this child size bald eagle was sitting on Egg Lake Rd and ate some tasty roadkill. It didn’t move when I drove by, just looked at me, from 3 feet away. I know, Bald Eagle, not really news to us, right? But to see those majestic birds so close, blows my mind every time.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 9th, 2008 at 10:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Puget Sound Blood Center\r\n    The rooming list is made and on the back desk. Tory you can just make keys for them because everything is being taken care of by their office.\r\n    Call me if anybody needs anything from off-island. Remember, I have a small car so no major Costco runs ok? :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 8th, 2008 at 5:51 pm\r\n\r\n    FED EX\r\n    Please send the gift certificate on the back desk via Fed ex to address on fed ex slip (will be billed to guest’s fed ex account, fed-ex pick up is scheduled, thanks Morgan). The only thing I forgot to ask is, how fast guests needs the delivery. Cindy, can you call her in the morning (number on fed-ex slip) and ask, please? Morgan also scheduled the tracking number being send to guest directly.\r\n\r\n    FRONT LINE\r\n    Please always call the call center if you leave early, so they don’t transfer calls to an empty office.\r\n\r\n    TORY WEDNESDAY\r\n    You’ll have a small group check in. I emailed group leader and asked for rooming list and form of payment, look for her email. Also: make keys & invoices ready right when you get here. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    The weather alert says we’ll get snow on Friday. Yeah, just for you, Cindy!\r\n    Khai Says:\r\n    December 7th, 2008 at 9:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Cindy :)\r\n\r\n    I haven’t blogged for a very long time. I need to get in the habit again. Anyways, Raquel won’t be in until 11 in the morning, because there is only one check out.\r\n\r\n    Nothing else too exciting, but I did have one walk in :) haha, yay!\r\n\r\n    Have a great day!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2008 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    YES YES YES\r\n    We won the Christmas decoration contest, yipiehh, E first place, BR third place. Thank you Seth, Regino & Elena! We rock!\r\n\r\n    OMG\r\n    The entire 10th birthday party from 312/314 just marched into the lobby and presented me with the hugest piece of lemon – white chocolate birthday cake. That totally made my day. Nothing like like a bunch of barefoot, giggling 10 year olds in costumes and a load of good old sugar to take your mind off things. Thank you so much, princess guests!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    The lights outside building A are working. Thank you, Seth.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 4th, 2008 at 8:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan,\r\n    Cindy will be here around noon (kids doctor appt.) Have a great shift, eat your citrus fruit to fight off the Scurvy!\r\n\r\n    Got a handful of walk-ins tonight, yeah! Thursdays are good for that.\r\n    Stay warm, everybody!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2008 at 2:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Christmas lights\r\n    Please remember to unplug all the lights when you are the closing person.\r\n    Front office\r\n    I am going to be moving my office to the front office(Steffi’s)for a few months, and I will be taking front office shifts. Adam will be working in my office with Laura during this time. Steffi will move her computer to where the server is.. I have moved most of the things each of you may need to the back luggage room,but if you see something that needs moved from the back to the luggage room for easy access please feel free to move it. This is so the front office will not be the main storage area and it will no longer be a spot of working while you are taking a shift in the front office. Sorry for any inconvenience this may be for anyone. But we appreciate the flexibility..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2008 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    This is a test, test, Monday, Tuesday, test…\r\n    Oh man, these 1 day work weeks are killing me. Thank you all for making it possible for us to get away. It was fabulous. If you are ever in Seattle, eat at Ocho in Ballard, excellent tapas bar. I actually dreamed about the gambas, yum.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Well it’s certainly refreshing to see a non-employee making use of the blog. Hey Brian!\r\n\r\n    Khaili the only thing I have to pass on is that the folks in 314 would like a late check-out. I told them 11:30 but if you could ask R/R for a noon check-out they would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!\r\n    Brian - San Juan Outfitters Says:\r\n    November 28th, 2008 at 8:15 am\r\n\r\n    Hello Earthbox staff (Morgan, Tory, Steffi, Khaili, and Elena\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to let you all know that San Juan Outfitters is available for both kayak and whale watch tours tomorrow if you have guests looking for activities. We also have a kayak tour scheduled today, however we have a 70% chance of rain and 20mph winds forecasted. We will see how the weather turns out. Tomorrow is only 30% chance of rain, with low winds. We have been seeing most of our local wildlife: seals, sea lions, porpoise, eagles. Our Resident Killer Whales have been around as well. Call if you have inquiries 360-378-1962. Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\n    Brian Goodremont\r\n    San Juan Outfitters\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2008 at 2:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PLANTERS IN POOL HOUSE\r\n    The gardeners said we’ll need to water them in between them coming once a month. So Morgan, could you water them once per week or every 2 weeks if they seem dry, please? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 24th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    FUN WRP FACT\r\n    If you ever have to look up an older reservation and the system says: not found. Go to the reservation desk – search – set time to be searched (i.E. May 2008 – November 2008), then punch in the name or reservation number, and you’ll find it. Yeah!\r\n\r\n    DUDE, WHERE IS OUR VAN?\r\n    Laura has it for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n    FILM TIP\r\n    Deja Vu, a super trippy ferry bombing, thriller, terrorist drama, sci-fi kind of thingy with Denzel Washington. Very cool with lot’s of plot twists which will bend your mind.\r\n\r\n    I want to be called: WATERFOWL QUEEN from now on. Ask Daniel & Dave, they know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    What a nice night. The cold drove our guests into the lobby to stock up on teas and hot chocolate and I spend lot’s of time just chatting, about us, our name change (most people really like the Earthbox name), the economy, Germany, food. It was like hanging out with friends. Thank you, Earthbox visitors.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2008 at 10:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Windy!\r\n    The pool was extremely popular today. We ran out of pool towels and I had to use room towels. Please tell Raquel: mia culpa!\r\n\r\n    This is so cool. I have never seen anything like it (on Vessel watch). During the biggest wind gusts all the ferries were huddled north of Cypress Island, like puppies seeking warmth or something.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2008 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m the walk-in queen, yeah!\r\n    Thank you, spontaneous people, for checking us out!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    November 19th, 2008 at 1:56 pm\r\n\r\n    there is a blocking card for bird rock in the key cupboard with some small keys on it for the garbage alley padlock. i’m not sure how we are going to work this out for the br opening person…but as of now…that is where the keys are.\r\n\r\n    today went well. nothing to pass on.\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Kyle stopped by to make the key for Steffi’s file cabinet and was all out of blank keys. He said he will return in a few days when he gets more.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 17th, 2008 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Jacob, he is 14 today,, WOW. where has the time gone.\r\n    Morgan found out that our office kitty actually belongs to a guy that lives behind Car Quest. We are going to see if he wants to give the kitty to Ben T.\r\n    It is beautiful in FH today, crisp and clear..\r\n    This is Tere in housekeepings last week, she is leaving on Thursday, Raquel and some others are going to get together on Wednesday night at Downriggers, stop by for a soda or order some food, it is dutch treat.. But we are all welcome..\r\n    Have a great Monday…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 16th, 2008 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    I was just reading around on our website when I stumbled upon “What’s in a name”. It’s a really nice & honest description by Adam about why and how we changed names. This will really help us helping our guests (and us) through the transition. Thanks Adam.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 14th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    KAITLYN:\r\n    Your frames are here in my office.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 13th, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Buddy Kitty hates the vacuum cleaner. Morgan’s car is adorable. The full moon is gorgeous. And that’s all the news.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 13th, 2008 at 11:41 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you Khai, I did mean the key drop:)(I can never make my smiley faces work??)\r\n    Kitty\r\n    Ben T one of our repeat guests wants to adopt our office cat.. I called the Animal Shelter and they have not had anyone report a cat like ours missing. I think Ben and his wife would make an awesome home for our kitty.. It is going to get cold out and I cannot imagine having to let our little kitty sleep outside. Morgan was on board with this… Speaking of Morgan, I CAN’T wait to see your MINI…. CAN I DRIVE IT:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    … that little typo and the bottom of my last post was supposed to be this:\r\n    ♥\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    I love our kitty! Soo cute.\r\n\r\n    Anyways, Cindy, this time, the envelope is in the outgoing mail and properly addressed :)\r\n    Everything was pretty laid back, only two check ins.\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    I left a note for you in your box. Just want to make sure that you get it.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, I will be back on Sunday.\r\n    &heats;\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    I think Cindy meant the key drop box instead of the outgoing mail box when she was talking about the 15 minute signs :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 4:46 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing I forgot, I put the signs for the door (the ones that were tacked on the wall by the old stamp machine with the “we will be back in 15min)) inside the outgoing mail box. I didn’t like the look of all of those signs hanging off the wall.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:22 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning:)\r\n    We have a cute white and gray company cat.. We don’t know who he belongs to or if he is lost, Morgan has put notices in all the online papers here in FH, but for right now, that cut kitty is welcome in the office, we have food for it on Morgan’s back porch and a comfy box with a warm blanket:)just make sure you put the kitty out if you are the closing person.\r\n    Please make sure you check the sugar dish in the lobby (often), it gets very yucky…\r\n    During this SLOW time of year, housekeeping is not in the office to clean it as much as they are in the summer, i would like the closing person the vacumn and wipe off the counters, coffee table, coffee service table etc… as well as continue to empty the garbage’s.\r\n    Happy Wednesday..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 11th, 2008 at 10:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena:\r\n    There is a note for you in your box. They wanted your cell phone number but I just told them that you would return their call. It sounded kinda sketchy, but I took her number anyways.\r\n    Cindy:\r\n    That gift certificate, etc. is in the outgoing mail\r\n\r\n    Good night! See you tomorrow.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 11th, 2008 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Hey all! On the days that we answer Bird Rock’s phone we need to print out their reconciliation sheet if we make any transactions. So if you make a reservation or process any online reservations just print out the report at the end of the night and put it in Cindy’s box. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 10th, 2008 at 3:07 pm\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    I have a call in to Kyle. If he stops by or calls, can you please direct him to my file cabinet. I would like to have a key for it (just the upper part).\r\n\r\n    PRINTONYX\r\n    M, our map paper should be ready tomorrow. Will you swing by Printonyx and pick it up, please? Gracias.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 10th, 2008 at 2:38 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n\r\n    I got a call from the taxi guy tonight and I guess he never came by to get the money. He said he’d be by tomorrow morning to get it. Just a heads up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2008 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    Thank you for fixing Bird Rock’s door. Yeah, little black box.\r\n    Happy foggy night, everybody.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2008 at 1:29 am\r\n\r\n    TAXI\r\n    Carla, just so you know, we are paying for Friday Harbor Taxi to take some folks out to RH in the morning. The driver will come in after 9 to get paid. I think it’ll be around $24. Just take the money out of one of the till’s and write a note about it and leave it in the cash drawer. THANKS!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 8th, 2008 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK LOG\r\n    BR’s website is down. Which is not the only technical difficulty experienced tonight.\r\n\r\n    SPEIDEN TV\r\n    Doesn’t work. I called tech support, switched receivers, to no avail. The tech support guy said the cable going from the satellite dish to the TV must be broken. I gave the guests a discount. We shouldn’t rent the room until that’s fixed (wrote maintenance request).\r\n\r\n    FRONT DOOR\r\n    None of the keys work even though they aren’t dead. Morgan and I will read it and try to trouble shoot.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    November 8th, 2008 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW! What a WINDY DAY! I have had a great time filling in this morning and all went well. I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend and I look forward to working tomorrow morning!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    And guest starring tomorrow, exclusively here at Earthbox Motel, this weekend only: the amazing, the unforgettable, the wonderful CARLA, yeah!\r\n    Call Tory at Bird Rock if you have questions, for a little bit bigger questions call Morgan, know that Raquel & Regino are here (on speed dial on the phones) for all your van & housekeeping needs. For the really big questions call me at home. Have fun! I can’t wait for the summer to work with you again.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    #1369703 – The spa did call back to confirm the cancellation of massage.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    1374434\r\n    K, I think one of us hit “checked out” instead of “cancel”. I canceled it. Thanks for finding it. And thanks again for the fabulous movie tip “War Inc”, I’m still singing “blow me up” in my head. The best ever day-after-the-election movie, ever, really drove the point home.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Steve took our coffee maker, it needs to be repaired. He will try to bring it back tomorrow. Maybe we can get a coffee maker from HK and make a pot that way?\r\n\r\n    Happy rainy day.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 12:52 pm\r\n\r\n    1374434 does anyone know what this is? a mistake may be?\r\n    thanks for checking it out!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Rain rain go away… Sorry Khai I know how you LOVE the rain… I would love it to snow. :)\r\n    I have had to make some schedule changes with the upcoming weeks so please everyone make sure you check the schedules. Tory will you please check with me about something new for next week.:)\r\n    Candles\r\n    I have ordered some more candles when the order comes in can you please put them in my office.\r\n    Have a great Thursday..\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    DVSAS fundraiser – If you get any calls for guests calling for this, please offer them 20% off. By the way, DVSAS stands for domestic violence and sexual assault services.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Khaili,\r\n    Thanks for catching the situation in 310. He was probably just out watching the election results (Go Obama!) I was just waiting to process his massage payment until I talked to Cindy. It’s all good, but thanks for following up on this.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    Slow night, but it gave me time to follow the election :)\r\n\r\n    Reservation 1373000 was in the new bookings yesterday, but was booked by Laura and only the 10% was charged. I confirmed the reservation, but by closing time no one showed. I looked over by 310 and I couldn’t tell if someone was in there or not…? Laura do you know the deal?\r\n\r\n    I couldn’t get the tree lights to turn on. Seth is working on it.\r\n\r\n    ♥\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 3rd, 2008 at 5:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    Please check Bird Rock’s WRP during the week for new bookings, process them, follow up on add-ons, so we won’t miss things. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 3rd, 2008 at 12:41 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Morgan, please put the bikes under the pool patio cover tonight. Everybody, please start bringing the bikes in & out to protect them from the elements a little bit. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2008 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Khaili, sister of Dillon, the hunter!\r\n    I printed out spa & lodging vouchers with the new logo. Can you please assemble some, or a lot, depending on how busy you are? Have a great shift. We never work with each other anymore. I miss you.\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan, son of Glen, the firefighter!\r\n    Some firefighting dude dropped off your dad’s award (in your box).\r\n    I saved all Earthbox documents in ‘my documents’ – ‘earthbox documents’. Will you please work on the adventure vouchers & the beach cruiser release forms? I’ll do the pet policies on Monday. Is there anything else we need to change?\r\n\r\n    Don’t forget to turn the clocks an hour back tonight. Happy windy autumn weekend everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    The house keeping department will not be here tomorrow. I blocked out departing rooms to be cleaned on Sunday or Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY HALLOWEEN!\r\n\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 3:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Reviews\r\n    Please make sure they are turned in by the end of today as requested by Laura.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Check out Morgan’s GREAT carvings on the pumpkin, great job Morgan…\r\n    Have a great weekend everyone.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    GMMPG (Good morning Morgan, Pool God)\r\n    Happy Monday! Would you please check out the sauna controls? Somebody diddled with it and now the display says it heats to only 45 degrees. Can you also start vacuuming the hot tub every other day? Aaaaand…..will you please work on the pool trouble shooting & maintenance list? Thank you, thank you. I’ll see you at 2.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2008 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    PEER REVIEWS\r\n    Please don’t forget to submit your peer reviews & employee surveys by tomorrow (put in sealed envelope in E’s safe with Laura’s name on it). We will conduct employee reviews starting in a couple of weeks, yeah.\r\n\r\n    Also: VOTE!\r\n    I am Steffi, and I approve this message.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena called to let us know that the front door at Bird Rock was open. I don’t think that the timer was turned off. So maybe Seth can run down there and check it out. Also the lights in the front trees are not turning on by the breaker box in the bushes.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    I love the color of our website.. Very nice:)\r\n    Happy Tuesday the 28th:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 8:46 am\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Hey all. Here’s a little closing procedure to add to your duties during the winter. Whomever is closing needs to make sure that pool towels are stocked before you lock up. Since the pool house opens up an hour before the office; we need to make sure there are enough towels to make it though until opening. Thanks all!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin’ Khai’,\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that 105 was dirty. I checked a couple into it and it wasn’t cleaned. I upgraded them to a Sky so they’re hopefully happy.\r\n\r\n    Both Raquel and Regino will not be in on Sunday and Monday. (At least Raquel anyway) Raquel has left her keys and her cell phone to be given to Orozco. Building A is shut down starting tomorrow so Housekeeping may not clean those rooms until Monday. According to Raquel we will only have 4 housekeepers tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    On that same note. If anyone who is in Building A wants to stay over by all means let them. I think the room are just blocked out in the “Unit Closeouts” section. You can unmark individual rooms as needed. I don’t think they will completely shut everything down in that building until early next week anyway.\r\n\r\n    Took quite a few walk-ins today. Glad the weather has been nice to help keep us busy. I made new “Back in 15 minute” signs. They are hung up behind the old stamp machine. There are three. One for the front desk cell, one for my cell, and even a shiny one for you Khaili. They are all done in the same style but with different color schemes. They are also marked on the back as to which cell number they correspond to… What? What’s with “the look?” It’s not like I was “bored” or anything… They had to be changed anyway because they all still said “ELEMENTS’ on them. So there. :D\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2008 at 8:34 am\r\n\r\n    Has anyone else had a problem with WRP logging off randomly? I swear I have been on it for 45 minutes and it has logged me on 10 times.\r\n    Frustrating….\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Laura, for a great meeting and yummy pizza, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Cynthia, a local massage therapist, will come by in the next couple of days to borrow two tables from our conference center.\r\n\r\n    Khaili, teen star front desk goddess, please read WRP alarm first thing this morning, you’ll need to go get some chocolate.\r\n\r\n    Took our front desk plunger and brought it to Bird Rock. Kaitlyn couldn’t find one anywhere.\r\n\r\n    Made quite a few reservations for this weekend tonight and had some walk ins. That’s the way, aha aha, I like it:)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2008 at 4:50 pm\r\n\r\n    THANK YOU!\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for coming to the meeting. Your participation in these meetings is so vital to our organization. I really appreciate it. Not to mention what you do every single day…\r\n\r\n    I have a special thanks to Steffi and Cindy for holding down the fort this summer. You guys are champs!\r\n\r\n    LOTS of love and gratitude,\r\n    Laura\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    Steffi:\r\n    Karla’s keys are in your box.\r\n\r\n    And… umm..\r\n    thats it. haha. See you all soon.\r\n\r\n    ♥\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 3:56 pm\r\n\r\n    OOPS\r\n    332\r\n    The heater is still not working, BUT A new unit will be arriving in about 1 week.\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Is out of order until Friday.\r\n    Friday 10-24-08 1PM\r\n    Pizza at ELEMENTS lobby for all employee’s, discussion about upcoming winter hours and stuff..\r\n    New name… Well as you can see we are in the process of the new name change. Adam and Laura have decided on the Earth Box motel & spa. For now we will still answer as normal. Adam or Laura will let us know when to start answering the phone with the new name.\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 3:51 pm\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 20th, 2008 at 1:19 pm\r\n\r\n    ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n\r\n    We are trying to make sure that all of the phone lines are transferring to the call center. Only the 378-5800 line should allow going to our message machine. So… what that means is whenever we return a message we need to ask the caller what number they dialed. If they dialed the “800″ number or “4000″ we need to ask if they were transferred here by the call center. There is a chart next to the back phone to keep track of the date and number dialed. Thanks everybody for helping with this.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Norman Murray is going to come by on Monday morning first thing and look at the leaking out of one of the connectors. Dave will be in on Monday am to look at the heater.\r\n    FYI~Norman’s phone number is 840-9311, he works with Rob, when Rob is unavailable.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2008 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Jacuzzi Update\r\n\r\n    Well sorry to say but we are having problems again. When I checked on it this morning the water temp was in the mid-60’s and there was water leaking out of one of the new connections that was installed on Friday. Dave knows about the heater. We need to call the guy who installed the filter assy. to come fix the leak. I don’t remember his name but Cindy knows it. The whole thing is shut down so it’s not leaking for now. The leak isn’t too bad but it does need to be fixed.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 18th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    101\r\n    Wasn’t cleaned today. Please let Raquel know and make sure it will be cleaned.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Very pleasant night here. Not at Bird Rock, where as we speak the fire alarm went off for the second time tonight. Chris and Seth are excellent, wonderful people and I wouldn’t know what to do without them. I’m going down there now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 2:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Class of 1998\r\n    Cindy has graciously given a special rate for anyone who is attending the FHHS Class of ‘98 Reunion tomorrow. $99 per night rate on everything except the Sea and the Wind Places. Thanks Cindy!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 11:19 am\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    West Mechanical will be here later today to test the relay. Please let them in the room.\r\n    321\r\n    The breaker is replace, that breaker actually runs the vanity area 320,321 and 322, please let me know if anything else happens, try to get as much detail as possible when it happens, that helps with the troubleshooting.\r\n    Men’s Orca Room breaker\r\n    The breaker was tripping because Elderhostel had a portable heater on in their little office. Please remember that we are not wired up to have all those little units going full bore along with everything else.\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    New part is in and being replaced as I write:)\r\n    Fishing Pole Container\r\n    I have shipped this off to the guests #1259974, if they call let them know it went out UPS on 10-17-08, no charge to the guests. Ask me if questions.\r\n    Kaitlyn\r\n    I LOVE THE PICTURES IN LAURA AND MY OFFICE… THANK YOU SO MUCH.. and thanks for taking Karla’s shift up here on Thursday..\r\n    Have a great WEEKEND…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2008 at 11:54 am\r\n\r\n    101,102,103,210,202,203, 117,118,217,218\r\n    The internet problem is real in these room, Bob J Chris went out to 202 last night when a guest was having problems and saw first hand how inconsistent the signal is. Chris is working with Rock Island to resolve this. Please ask each upcoming reservation if they would like to use the wireless while they stay with us and make sure you put them in a room that has a strong signal which is all of them but the ones above. The other issue I want to bring up is when room 202 was having problems with his internet two days ago I would have liked it if someone would have offered to move him RIGHT away. I have left a message with Elderhostel to give this guests the opportunity to move. Please let’s remember that it is ALWAYS our first priority to do WHATEVER we can do if possible to make our guests happy and comfortable. That is what we do we are HOSPITABLE..\r\n    New lights are up in the pool area.\r\n    Room 332 is in the process of getting fixed\r\n    Laura will be back tomorrow :)\r\n    Biscotti\r\n    The extra biscotti from the coffee shop is now in the back luggage area, please make sure the plate by the coffee area in the lobby stays stocked so that our guests can enjoy a yummy cookie with their coffee.\r\n    Bob J is working on our phone system, we are getting it resolved but we still have one line that won’t forward to FL, they are still working on resolving that. Please let me know if you discover any new issues.\r\n    Battery Backups\r\n    Chris T bought us some new battery backups, we all all set for if the power goes out…\r\n    312, 306, Wind Place\r\n    I ordered replacement blinds for the above rooms, please let Seth know when they come in so he can install them.\r\n    New Name\r\n    It is coming, we should know shortly… Stand by…\r\n    Fishing pole in back room\r\n    We have called several times to get more information on the address and cc to use to ship this back. Tory please call guest again tonight.\r\n    Thanks all your AWESOME..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2008 at 1:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Ok a couple of things.\r\n\r\n    1 – Two boxes of luggage tags have arrived. They are in the back.\r\n\r\n    2 – Update on the jacuzzi. A guy from Northwest Hot Springs just happened to be on the island today. (Lucky Us) He took a look at the filter valve and ordered us a new gasket. It should be overnighted according to him. Please call Seth and I when it arrives. Seth’ll get it installed an I’ll get everything running and the jacuzzi reheating. Please apologize to any guests who may be put out by the lack of a jacuzzi. Thanks for putting up with the trouble!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 13th, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy– reservation 1339580 wanted to talk to the manager about the fact that the hot tub wasn’t in service…\r\n\r\n    In the kitchen of 322 there is a plug in that isn’t working. It is the one to the right of the microwave… please have Regino or Dave check it out.\r\n\r\n    The plug for the bath tub in 301 doesn’t fit. Please let Raquel or Regino know.\r\n\r\n    I won’t be back until Sunday…\r\n    Thank you again, Steffi, for rearranging the schedule for me so I could have Saturday off! I really appreciate it.\r\n    Have a great week everyone.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 13th, 2008 at 2:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Well sound like I missed a “fun” weekend. The Weezer concert was excellent though.\r\n\r\n    Cindy asked me to remind everyone. When making a walk-in reservation make sure that if you don’t manually type in the guest’s credit card number in the information edit screen, the system does not save the CC number. Alternately you can swipe the card through in the payment screen and instead of selecting the “Process Payment” button you can select the “Swipe Credit Card and put on File” button. Of course then you have to go back to the payment screen again to actually run the card through for the payment. If you have any questions please let me know.\r\n\r\n    I am going to be doing some pool maintenance this afternoon evening. I will be changing out the water in the jacuzzi and hopefully, if I can swing it, vacuuming out the pool. We’ll see how it goes. Jacuzzi should be fully heated by tomorrow morning. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen,\r\n    our last group of the year is safely tucked away in their rooms. This officially concludes our high season 2008. Great job everybody! And applause, please!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2008 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    We are down to the last box of bag tags, Cindy knows and is ordering more.\r\n    Carmen from Susie’s Mopeds came and got the moped for the winter. Morgan, do you know where the helmet is? I couldn’t find it.\r\n    See you tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I love fall :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Crazy, crazy night, but all is well. I have survived my first shift alone. A big thank you goes out to KHAILI! You are soooo awesome for staying 3 hours late! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Steffi, thanks for helping out with room service, YOU are a rockstar! Laura, thanks for helping with the “ferry rush!” Hope everyone has a great rest of the weekend!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI & CARLA ARE ROCK STARS!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Crazy night!!\r\n    Oh my!\r\n\r\n    read the following reservations: 1344570, 1343171, 1345712\r\n\r\n    I know I am forgetting something but I don’t think it is super important so I think we will be okay.. I’m tired.\r\n    See you in the morning…\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2008 at 4:06 pm\r\n\r\n    WELCOME TO GIRL WEEKEND AT ELEMENTS AND BIRD ROCK\r\n    Saturday is gonna be tough, lot’s of check-ins, Carla’s first alone night. Khaili will stay until after the 3:45 ferry, that should help a lot (Thank you, Khai). Carla, sweety, call me at BRrrr any time, and if something major happens I can always run up there.\r\n    Bird Rock: 378-5848\r\n    Bird Rock Cell: 317-6488 (call that if you don’t get through, but need to talk right that second).\r\n    Yes, we can give excellent customer service while doing 45 things all at once, oh yeah!\r\n    And also: there is a humongous tub of sweets on my desk for all of us. It’s a Thank You from Michelle for having her guests stay here with us on her wedding. Go at it, Khaili, you earned it!\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Please remind Regino to look at the heater. Guest said it didn’t work but didn’t want us to check it out right there and then.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Wheee! I love power outages. Except when I’m working. Just when we assembled all the parts necessary to hook Elena’s laptop to my cell, and a printer to the battery-backup, the power goes back on. Aarrgh. :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2008 at 8:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, ran my little behind off tonight.\r\n\r\n    Here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    The breaker to the men’s room and the hallway keeps popping. Can we please have super Dave have a look?\r\n\r\n    338\r\n    Hadn’t been cleaned. Please make sure Raquel knows and cleans it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    PHONE CONSOLE\r\n    Gave me error messages and didn’t let me do anything. After unplugging it I was able to do wake-up calls (thanks for the tip, Cindy). But I still can’t check in/out guests. It gives me a busy signal and a “wrong number” sign.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please pay Bob’s for the cab for the lady in 207 and make sure Bob knows to help her to the float plane with her luggage (he knows, just remind him, please).\r\n\r\n    THINGS TO DO\r\n    - assemble pet policies\r\n    - roll silverware\r\n    - make gift certificates\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 8th, 2008 at 6:03 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The Spa also has a Savor The San Juans Special: $10 off any treatment through October (SBS massages count as one treatment). We may pass those savings on to our guests, but we need to make sure to write “Savor the San Juans” on the voucher, or we create a book keeping nightmare. Thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 6th, 2008 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Well 312 is a problem child, Dave and Opalco tightened everything they could and at this point we have to wait until it happens again (if it does) and hope that Dave is close at hand so that he can come right away to see it in action. We have been given the go ahead to rent out the room, SO when and if it happens next please refund the guests for that night and call me ASAP.. The reason we are putting it in service is because it only seems to happen when it is in use. It is very sporadic when it happens. Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 11:12 pm\r\n\r\n    *sigh*\r\n    Well this was a busy busy night. It feels like summer only worse because there is only one of us at the desk. Thank the gods that I didn’t have to do any room service runs. We are almost all sold out. Only 2 Sun places remain open. I made three runs to the pool house for towels. We are completely out now by the way.\r\n\r\n    - Khai, you need to know about something. I don’t know if you have ever had to deal with a cash security deposit before. The guest #1338229 was a walk-in and paid in cash, including the deposit. The deposit is in the safe but the most important thing is that you let Regino/Raquel know when the guest comes in to check-out. R/R need to inspect the room before you can give the guests their deposit back. It’s rather inconvenient but it’s really the only way to make it work. (Of course you may already know this so I just wrote a paragraph for no good reason.)\r\n\r\n    - We are out of Apple cider in the office. I never got a chance to run back to the Orca room and look for more. If you have chance could you grab some. Or maybe R/R can send some up for you. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n    - I talked to the folks in the Wind house. They put the batteries back in the smoke detector and haven’t had any problems since. The guest in there thinks it may have been dust burning off of the baseboard heaters. Both he and I agree that they were probably the first people this season to turn on the heat so it is a plausible theory.\r\n\r\n    - That’s thankfully about it. I’m going to bed now. :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    I LOVE RAIN!\r\n    See you tomorrow ;)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 9:46 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    The guests in 312 moved to 341, I refunded their stay last night. Dave is off island today and will be here to check on the issue tonight or tomorrow, until then 312 is marked out of service, all circuits will be set off.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Next week the beach cruisers will delete in size.. We will move all but 6 bikes from ELEMENTS to the off site storage where they will stay dry and warm for the winter. IF you see an upcoming sunny break and we are busy with reservations, please give me the heads up so we can move some bikes back to the property.\r\n    The bikes that are left here, will need to be taken out every morning and put under the cover on the pool patio every night. Of course if it is pouring in the AM you do not need to move them out but if the sun peaks through please move them out..\r\n    That’s it, well done everyone, HAPPY SATURDAY..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    I guess I was a little fast with my declaration that all is well.\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Smoke alarm went off for no reason. Stay-over guests, please call Seth or Regino and have him look at that tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    M-Dawg\r\n    I hope you feel a little better. Please call me if you need help tomorrow. I run up and help out.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a rainy night! It was fun working with Steffi again and learning all the ropes of the front desk. I got a chance to run down and see the beautiful Bird Rock Hotel. It looks fabulous! I ran into Chris down there, she is sooooo nice! Hope everyone has a great weekend!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Khai, please read #1336844 and #1110183. Must be the rain.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Has light issues again, same thing, all electricity in the bathroom doesn’t work and the wall where the beds are on, but all the breakers are fine. Left msg with Dave. This is a stay-over. Please try to have Dave come and look at it tomorrow. So weird.\r\n\r\n    All else is good. It is such a pleasure to work with Carla again. Love, love, love having a great crew. Thank you all:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 2nd, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone!\r\n    I have a little story to tell you all:\r\n    So, I forgot my uniform at home today and decided to run home at lunch to get it.. only to get all the way out to my house and back to the high school, SOMEHOW leaving my uniform at my house again. What the heck? I also locked myself out of the lobby for the second time tonight. I think I’m loosing it. And no, Cindy, I am NOT on drugs. (She questioned me earlier, joking of course!)\r\n\r\n    Pretty exciting night, actually. I had two room services. Anyways, just wanted to let everyone know that they should read res. #1106523 notes, just to give you all a heads up.\r\n\r\n    Steffi:\r\n    Thank you soo much for dealing with my pain in the butt schedule request! And thank you everyone else who had to cover for me. I really do appreciate it.\r\n\r\n    Cindy: Exciting little note on your desk.. of course if you are reading this than you are probably at your computer meaning that you would have already gotten the note…. I guess I just wanted to say hi :)\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, that is all for now.\r\n    See you on Saturday. ♥\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    October 1st, 2008 at 9:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan some folks from the Elderhostel group will be coming into the front desk around 10:15am on Friday morning and will be needing a shuttle up to the airport to catch a flight at 11:15am and need to check in around 10:30am also a couple will need a ride down to the ferry landing to get onto the 11:10am sailing.\r\n\r\n    Also I wanted to put a little post-it note reminder up for Steffi in the blog about the remaining balance for baggage handling for the group that checked in this evening.\r\n\r\n    Night Night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 29th, 2008 at 4:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday,\r\n    The lights in room 312 were looked at by Dave and he couldn’t find anything wrong with them, so please let him know if it happens again.\r\n    Elena got the stickers done for the cook books. WELL DONE ELENA..\r\n    Winter rates\r\n    Winter rates are upon us, so please don’t hesitates to use them right now for resistant shoppers.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Can you please take the bike on your porch over to the bike shop on Tuesday.. THANKS MUCH\r\n    Phone Charges\r\n    If anyone notices phone charges on a guests bill that ends in the last four digits of #7442, please delete them off the customers record, that is our after hours number.\r\n    Thanks everyone:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    Please read the notes in res. 1322841. Thanks.\r\n    Oh, and by the way, I can’t figure out how to do those stickers… any suggestions for me?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 27th, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n\r\n    Gooooood morning Khaili! Another Elderhostel group is arriving today. I have made up a rooming list and you are welcome to pre-print out all the invoices if you want. They will probably be trickling in throughout the day so it’s up to you. I hope everything runs soother for you to today than Saturday. I’ll see ya at 2.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 26th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning beautiful Khai!\r\n\r\n    VAN RIDES\r\n    Regino is off on Saturday, so you don’t have a van driver. Please call cabs for people if they need a ride (Clipper, Elderhostel) and we’ll pay for them.\r\n\r\n    310\r\n    is a stay-over and their TV picture is totally fuzzy. I wiggled the cables, but nothing. Can you please make sure Raquel or Morgan looks at that?\r\n\r\n    Wind Place\r\n    is a stay-over and has several light bulbs out. Can you make sure Raquel goes over there and replaces them when she does the tidy, please?\r\n\r\n    Leetle Job\r\n    I left a little job for you on the back desk: making an ELEMENTS logo sticker with our 800 number on it and putting it in the new fabulous cook books we will be selling. The books are $25 plus tax. Please make the sticker, put in books, put books in gift shop.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, have a wonderful day. I’ll be at BR the next couple of nights, call or email me if you need something.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 25th, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    All of a sudden, the bathroom lights, fan, heater failed, as well as all electricity on the wall along the beds. And it was not a breaker. The guests were so super sweet about it. I gave flashlight, a couple of candles and my lighter to them, so they could bathe. We need to tackle that tomorrow (left msg with Seth), the room is rented. M-dawg, please make sure we follow through on this.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, very nice night, lot’s of interesting guests to chat with and time to do so.\r\n    Lina & Stefan Says:\r\n    September 25th, 2008 at 2:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey :) everything’s fine with us :) hugs for everybody :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 11:50 am\r\n\r\n    I am REALLY going to miss all of you (Stefan, Lina, Nataylia and Daniil).. Please make sure you all email me:)…\r\n    Evaluations\r\n    Where are they, I have not found any in my box, please turn them in before Friday.\r\n    COHO\r\n    I went to COHO for dinner last night and it was FANTASTIC.. I strongly recommend everyone going. It has now my FAVORITE restaurant.\r\n    Espresso Machine\r\n    Seth will be bringing the espresso machine inside and installing it in the back luggage room, we shall have espresso at our finger tips..\r\n    First day of Fall, you can feel it, I finally broke down and turned my heater on last night…\r\n    Well done this summer everyone, we had some ups and downs but we made it thru to fall.\r\n    Have a wonderful week..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY:\r\n    As of today, we are no longer taking reservations for the Hideaway. It will still be on our website (and WRP) for a few more days. If you get any requests for the Hideaway specifically, please kindly direct the guests to David Waldron at 360.378.3070.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 8:04 am\r\n\r\n    VMCCA\r\n\r\n    I went out and took a few photos of the property with all the classic cars that are here. If anyone is interested you can just click on my name on this post and it will take you to my Flickr photo page. Peace!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2008 at 7:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Bye Bye Lina, Natalia, Stefan & Daniel. Is was such a pleasure meeting you and working with you. Have a great life and don’t forget us!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2008 at 2:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Just want to let everybody know that San Juan Island Outfitters are going to have Whale watching and Kayaking through out the winter.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Quite night. Nothing very exciting.\r\n    Okay, that’s all… haha :)\r\n\r\n    See you in… eight and a half hours.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Morgan, what a morning you had!\r\n    New schedule is up:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 12:11 pm\r\n\r\n    336 is fixed. w00t!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    Building D problems\r\n\r\n    - Well the new circulation pump that Seth installed barely a month ago failed. Dave thankfully was here in the morning and knew who to call. The pump was replaced relatively quickly with only 2 rooms affected by the lack of hot water. (so far). Discounts were given and everyone seemed happy.\r\n\r\n    - Pool door failed this morning. Thankfully all it needed was new batteries and to be reprogrammed. I took care of it once Stefan got here.\r\n\r\n    - Jury is still out on whether or not 336’s shower will be fixed. He will let us know and we will have to move some rooms around if he can’t get it fixed.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 10:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hokay. Here’s some things…\r\n\r\n    336\r\n    The handle to 336’s shower has broken. We almost couldn’t get the water off. I have given the guests some options and they have decided to stay in the room for tonight. They may ask for the key to 341 in the morning if they want to take a shower. I am fairly certain that Seth is gone this weekend so it may have to wait until Monday. I will try to move the rooms around to accommodate everyone. Maybe Rob will have to be called in. I don’t know.\r\n\r\n    103,104,105, & 106 all want a late checkout around 1pm. They are in the bike race and don’t think they will be done until 12ish. I told them 11:30 but I don’t know if they’re going to accept that. I’ll talk to housekeeping in the morning to see what we can do.\r\n\r\n    #1162115 and #1160114 were no shows at closing. Steffi can you please take a look at #1162115? They were moved to this date and they appear to have a monetary amount gift certificate. Can we still charge them for not arriving?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    will from now on email the daily room allocations to our front desk email. Make sure you print them out, process them and have them double checked. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    on Wednesday, 9/24, at 3.30 at Bird Rock. KHAILI will you please staff the front desk at E for an hour?. Elena, Kaitlyn, Tory & Chris, please be there. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 8:17 pm\r\n\r\n    YES, WE CAN!\r\n    It’s the shoulder season, baby. If you check in one of our guests, we have a nicer room available and aren’t too busy: upgrade our guest to the nicer room. If somebody looks frail, is on foot and you don’t have a long line of people, offer the guest to carry her luggage. If one of our guests looks through the menu guide, ask what kind of restaurant he might have in mind, offer to call for opening hours and reservations. Be kind, go out of your way and smile, because you can!\r\n\r\n    NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC’S “GUNS, GERMS & STEEL”\r\n    These are weird times in our country. One way to try to get a handle on things for me has always been to look at how things got the way they are. This 4 part series, which aired on the Discovery Channel (I got it from Netflix) has the simple premise that People’s fortunes hinge on their geography and their contact with guns, germs and steel. It’s history and anthropology at it’s finest. Did you know that the cradle of mankind, the Middle East, used to be lush with trees, rivers, game and grasses? People there moved on after using it all up and dominated other people, simply because those had less protein in their diet. Wow, I can’t wait to get home and watch more.\r\n    Much love!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Stefan!\r\n    Raquel will need your help schlepping some chairs tomorrow around 2. Seth & Regino are not available, so we will need your manly strength. Thank you in advance. I’ll see you at 12:30.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 9:23 am\r\n\r\n    WED. MORNING POOL USE:\r\n    This school year, Zach (a 3rd grader) will be coming to use the pool on Wednesday mornings from about 9-9:30. Please give his teacher the key. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2008 at 8:05 pm\r\n\r\n    109\r\n    Lilly, we have a very sweet couple staying in 109. They will need help with their luggage in the morning (to bring it to the lobby to store until they leave). Can you please help them or have Regino help them? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2008 at 6:24 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    is working, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Good weekend, everybody. Thanks for your hard work.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2008 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    LAURA:\r\n    A man is staying with us tonight that was on survivor Thailand. I mentioned that you auditioned for it and he thought that was awesome, so if you are here tomorrow he would love to talk to you. His reservation number is 1311638.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 13th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we are sold out!\r\n    Very busy today, lot’s of walk-ins, but nothing Khaili, Morgan and I couldn’t handle. Khaili met a tiny girl guest today, named Khaili. Her mom’s name was Stephanie. Weird!\r\n    New hot tub pump is installed, just needs to be connected, so still no bubbles, but close.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Lilly & Khaili, when preparing EH remote check-ins tomorrow, please make sure all the prices are suppressed.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 12th, 2008 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    iPod Alarm Clocks\r\n\r\n    I know this has been gone over before but something always happens to sideline it. Well anywhoo… We need to order a couple of the iPod alarm clocks for the Sky Places. 323 didn’t have one for some reason so I had to take the one out of 320. Please let Raquel/Regino know that so they can put a temp. replacement clock in 320. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Party to Regino. Looks like they had tons of good food. mmmmm….\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 12th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB (some more)\r\n    The tub is hot and working, but the jets are out of order until we get a part from the mainland.\r\n\r\n    LILLY & MORGAN\r\n    Please don’t forget to release the room I’m holding for the people staying in the Speiden, in case they decide not to move.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2008 at 6:52 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Is out of order. Dave will try to repair it tomorrow and we’ll go from there. Please let our guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2008 at 6:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CHA CHA CHA CHA CHANGES\r\n    I had to remake the current schedule. Everybody please look closely. Thank you all for your flexibility and your hard work.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 7:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino will be staying in 305 for the next 2 nights.\r\n\r\n    Cell phone was found. Stefan’s first night shift, yeah!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    CELL PHONE: Lilly used it yesterday when she was running errands for me. You might see if she still has it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 7:26 am\r\n\r\n    Ruh-ro Shaggy\r\n\r\n    The front desk/overnight cell phone is missing. I put my number up on the door sign but I hope no one calls the call center… Anybody know where it is? I called it and didn’t get an answer. :(\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2008 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning,\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY REGINO…:):):):):)\r\n    Elevator is fix :)\r\n    Sauna I am not sure, I will ask Seth today..\r\n    I am SO sad I missed the party on Saturday night, it sounds like you all had a blast.\r\n    Keep up the good work, and let’s fill those rooms up in September..\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    September 7th, 2008 at 1:08 pm\r\n\r\n    I thinks it been quite a long time since anyone of you heard from me. Well I’m back after a Great long night of dancing, up at the grange hall. Mexican dancing, couldn’t have imagined it being anymore fun. GO RAQUEL AND ELENA! They sure can boogie! Morgan too!\r\n    I know the season part is almost over, but the people are still vacationing like crazy. Sold out last night, and I am sure that it will be the same for next weekend.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Relatively slow night.\r\n\r\n    Morgan- there is a big box on the back desk, could you call for a UPS pickup, please?\r\n\r\n    That is about it. See you next weekend :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2008 at 7:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Khaili is selling our last room for the night as we speak. Good night so far, couple of glitches, nothing Khaili and I couldn’t fix, but happy guests and all is good.\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2008 at 3:56 pm\r\n\r\n    PUPPY DOGS\r\n    Going through upcoming reservations I notice that the pet fee is almost never added and nobody writes down the pet names. Just a reminder: pets cost $15 per night per pet. Please ask the guest for the pet name. Then, when checking in the guest, write the pet name on the pet policies.\r\n\r\n    BIKE 19 & 6\r\n    Gio (thanks for picking up the map paper today:) & Stefan, please bring those bikes to the repair shop tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    REGINO\r\n    Please make a complimentary reservation for Regino’s night shifts rather than blocking out a room. This way we won’t forget to clean the room and we can keep track of Regino’s nights spent here.\r\n\r\n    DIANA & OLESEA\r\n    Will have “saying good bye” drinks at the Peppermill tomorrow evening. Uaahhh, all those good byes make my tiny heart heavy.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2008 at 6:12 pm\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON\r\n    Lilly called adventure providers & restaurants and got their changes in opening hours now in the shoulder season. The sheet is in the back desk basket. Thank you, Lilly! We’ll bring a copy of that down to BR as well.\r\n\r\n    Any updates on the elevator or the sauna, Cindy?\r\n\r\n    We’ll have a nice busy weekend ahead, thank you, sun! Let’s enjoy those last couple of weekends where we are fully staffed. Give that customer service as if it were going out of style, yeah!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2008 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I ended up not having time to start doing the Microsoft check-in stuff for tomorrow….sorry! The phones just won’t quit…see you tomorrow at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2008 at 6:05 pm\r\n\r\n    SAUNA\r\n    is not warming up. The cover plate to the control panel is missing, the control panel seems to be functioning normally, but the stove is totally cold. I let Seth know, he’ll look at it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS\r\n    Wow, we played “where are my bags” with 4 rooms. In the end all was good, but we need to pay more attention when putting bags into the rooms and/or switching rooms at the last minute.\r\n\r\n    MICROSOFT\r\n    Please prepare remote check-in (rooming list on back desk) and call Regino to go get them around 12.30 tomorrow.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2008 at 10:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is in room 321 for 4 nights….just wanting to let you all know.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2008 at 12:47 pm\r\n\r\n    So…I have a little bit of a dilemma. My mom told me that my little brothers football game was on Saturday…but it turns out that it is on Friday at 7pm, and I have to work the night shift. Would anyone be willing to switch shifts with me, or even just work a few hours from like 7-9?? I would really, really appreciate it!! This is really important to me, and probably the last time I will ever get to see my brother play football :( ….so if anyone can work for me please let me know!! Thanks you guys…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a little bit more info before I go.\r\n\r\n    - The clock radio on the back desk needs to go into 311. it is missing it’s patch cable so guests can’t hook up their ipods to it. You can get new cables at Radio Shack.\r\n\r\n    - My friends Adam and Aaron may come by to get the keys to my apartment. They are a hanging on the wall in the back office. it’s ok to give them to the guys. Please just make sure they give them back. I like keeping an extra set here. ;)\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    POOL STUFF\r\n\r\n    - This is just some general information about pool care while I’m gone. I will be back on Thursday afternoon so really the only thing you will need to worry about is the Jacuzzi. Sadly we ran out of chlorine granules over the weekend. Bather load was so high that I had to use more than usual to keep the water clean. I have already called Gerard and he is going to try and get a bucket or two over here as soon as he can. If he can’t find anyone to drop it off here earlier, he’ll bring it with the normal shipment on Thursday. I went a bought a small container of chlorine to get us by. It’s a gray container with a red cap. It’ll be on the shelf inside the chem room. I have told Steffi what to do as far as chemicals go but I need everyone to be on the lookout for the water level in the Jacuzzi. It needs to be kept a couple of inches over the intake on the side. There is a hose just inside the chem room door you can use to fill it.\r\n\r\n    We should be fine. I need to do the regular water change in the Jacuzzi when I get back anyway. Call if you have questions. I should have service until Tuesday afternoon and then again starting late-morning on Thursday.\r\n\r\n    Peace out! :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    So Post San Juan was closed today and so was Printonyx….so I will do those errands tomorrow first thing when I get here!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodbye Diana, Emilia, and Marina! It was a great party. Thank you Lina for having a Birthday.\r\n\r\n    - Not much to report for tonight. A lot of people want late check-outs. It’s funny. Never before this year have I had so many people who assume they get the room for 24hrs. Odd. I’ve never been anywhere like that. (Except Vegas with their $25 6pm check-outs deals)\r\n\r\n    - Rooms 341 and 342 may want to move to a ground floor room tomorrow.They will talk about it and come by in the morning to see what is available if the decide to move.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    Can you please bring the nightgown to Post San Juan and pick up map paper at Printonyx on Tuesday when you get here? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 6:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Well done, team! Great Labor Day weekend. Great party, Lina. Good bye and thanks for all your hard work Emilia, Marina & Diana. Have a great life and write us!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I spoke with the guest and she left happy. Wrote maintenance request to check on those heaters.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Please always take down the name of the person you make a reservation with, see BR blog.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    When making a Clipper reservation or double checking one, please make sure to always suppress the pricing.\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEETS & FALL SPECIAL\r\n    I updated the rate sheets as per Adam. Please let our guests know about our fall special: $20 off the rack rate in October.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2008 at 7:17 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all. *yawn*\r\n\r\n    Just to give you a heads up. The lady in 312 might not be too happy when she checks out. She called me 3 times over the course of the night convinced that the room next door was bouncing ping pong balls off the wall. I went by at 2:00, nothing. I went by at 3ish, nothing, finally when she calls at 4am I hang out in the room for a bit. It was the baseboard heater coils/plate expanding and contracting. (glad I didn’t knock on 314’s door and ask them to stop :D ) We’ve never received a complaint about it before but try to make her happy. Right now she just as sleep deprived as I am. :) Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2008 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Map Paper\r\n    We have a small amount of map paper ready at Printonyx. I think they open at 10 on Saturday so perhaps someone can run up and grab it. It goes on account so we shouldn’t be charged for it. They will be printing out more for us by Tuesday. This amount should be able to tide us over until then. Hopefully. :)\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    bike number 10purple has a low back tire. needs air. kj\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    And I put the percentage symbol in the wrong place…\r\n    wow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 8:33 am\r\n\r\n    And by the way… I don’t know why I made my name khailiradden. I noticed that after I posted it, and then laughed at myself.\r\n    haha\r\n    khailiradden Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 8:31 am\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder that we changed the discounted items in the gift shop from %30 to %40.\r\n    Okay, that’s all for now :)\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2008 at 3:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n\r\n    There are 3 cartons of half and half in the luggage room fridge. So Khaili can take them to Cafe Zia in the morning. OK that is all.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 10:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is in room 329…I blocked it out for the next three night, just fyi!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 9:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow…busy night. I had about four or five walk-ins…everyone is trying to get out of the rain!\r\n\r\n    So the pool…unfortunately I didn’t catch the guys name or room number (a hectic moment in the lobby) but hopefully he will be stopping by in the morning….his son cut his foot when he was getting into the pool on some kind of metal or something. He said his son is ok but the cut bled pretty good for a while…he was pretty disappointed. Morgan went and checked it out and felt all around the stairs into the pool where the guest said his son cut his foot, but he didn’t find anything. So….if he comes in and mentions this, please get some specific information from him about where exactly in the pool he thinks his son cut his foot. Bummer :(\r\n\r\n    Other than that, not too much to report…pretty steady and busy from about 6:30 until about 8…whew. I guess the rain doesn’t always keep the tourists away…see you all tomorrow!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Hey-O!\r\n\r\n    - We now have 2 new locks for the bike rack. They are nifty “weather-sealed” locks so hopefully they will last a bit longer than the last. The front desk has a key, the cafe has a key, and we have a spare in Cindy’s cash bag. There is also a spare lock in the cupboard above the loo in the bathroom. That’s right! Three locks that all work on the same key! Exciting, right!? (I think I need to get out more.)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    - Remind me tomorrow to go to Ace and buy new locks for the bike racks. The second one is starting to fail now too. So much for “xtra tough” Masterlocks.\r\n\r\n    - Ordered Coffee for the back.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Not too much to much to report.\r\n    The folks in 103 moved to 203. They were complaining of the noise in the room next to them. Please tell housekeeping in the morning that the room needs to be cleaned. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Khaili, when you come to work tomorrow, can you please DRIVE (oh yeah!!!) to Post San Juan and have one of our guest’s luggage shipped back to him. Form on back desk, luggage in luggage room.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. Please look closely, some shifts have changed. Thank you all for being so flexible.\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    Please don’t forget to add 15% to the room service tab when adding the charges to a guest room.\r\n\r\n    RAZORS\r\n    If a guest needs a razor, we now have disposable ones for sale for $1 per razor. They are in our bathroom.\r\n\r\n    Great weekend everybody. An extra special THANKS to our housekeepers, who worked so hard and then some.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi has an EXCELLENT point about customer service. Remember that the guests who are coming here at the end of August deserve every much the same ounce of outstanding customer service as those coming in the beginning of June. I know, I know, easy for me to say since I haven’t been around much this summer, but it’s really true. You owe it to them and to yourselves. Remember how good it feels when you know that you are giving your best!\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you, thank you all for being troopers in the midst of chaos and frenzy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2008 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much to report. We need to cut off the lock on the bike rack closest to the office. There are a pair of bolt cutters in the maintenance room. I think we have a spare lock and key around here somewhere we can use.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2008 at 5:55 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW CAB IN TOWN – 298-4434\r\n    Friday Harbor Taxi is a new cab company in town. They also own the Dragonfly Inn, are really nice and have lower prices. Business cards are in drawer with stamps.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Morgan ordered new map paper. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    LOG OUT\r\n    Please don’t forget to log out of WRP when you leave your work station, so things are not done in your name against your will.\r\n\r\n    Happy end of August, everybody. Remember our guests visiting now deserve the same smile, recommendations, service and kindness as the ones who visited us in June. Much love:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 11:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Whoo. Relativly slow night except for a crazy moment that ran between 9:15 and ~10:15. Sheesh. Phones ringing, room service calls, ferry unloading, Frontline calling MY cell phone, phones ringing more WHEEEEEEEEEEEE.\r\n\r\n    Congrats to Khaili for passing her driving exam.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Lina :)\r\n    Have a great birthday…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 8:22 am\r\n\r\n    Thanks Lilly for leaving the info on why the emergency room was release. VERY helpful:)\r\n    GIO\r\n    WOW you are amazing, well done on your baking…\r\n    Welcome back Adam and Laura\r\n    Happy early birthday Ms. Khaili, what was it your Dad was saying this morning???(smile) What a wonderful gift you have been to me, I am SO blessed.. Love ya bunches XOXOXOX\r\n    Have a great weekend everyone,\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2008 at 10:24 pm\r\n\r\n    #1281211…had to release emergency hold room for 8/22, please read guest remarks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2008 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO & CAFE ZIA\r\n    Our Gio needs to see a doctor tomorrow. If she feels well enough, she will come and open cafe zia, then see the doctor around 8.30, if not we’ll play it by ear. We send you love and strength, Gio, and hope you feel better soon.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL & 310\r\n    Can you please let Raquel know that I took the luggage rack out of 310. I needed one and couldn’t find an extra.\r\n\r\n    REGINO & Backroads\r\n    Please remind Regino that he needs to load Backroads’ van around 11 AM tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2008 at 11:45 am\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    So, the guests in the hideaway checked out a day early. He came in this morning and was happy with the room, he just was unhappy that we advertised that it was pet friendly and then didn’t allow him to bring his dog in last night. I think that what happened is we had him sign the invoice and out of habit, had him initial that he wouldn’t have a pet. He was supposed to stay for two nights but decided to check out a day early even though I told him that he COULD have his pet in the room. He didn’t seem to he too upset, just ready to go home. ANYWAYS… moral of the story is to remember that the Hideaway is pet friendly :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Quiet night. Not too much to report.\r\n\r\n    - Some more slightly disappointed people checking in to the Hideaway. Another online booking rears it’s ugly head. I don’t think they’ll want to move but they weren’t too happy about it being down the street. I guess that whole thing about it being, “a block from ELEMENTS…” needs to be in bold.\r\n\r\n    - Regino is in 218 for his nights. First time in a while he hasn’t had to sleep in the Conference room. :)\r\n\r\n    Wet and windy night. Almost feels like winter….\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 3:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy- You are not supposed to tell anyone about my drive.. that way, if I fail I won’t have to admit it :)\r\n    There is a piece of luggage in the back that are labeled 216. They will be back tomorrow morning to get that.\r\n\r\n    See you in the morning!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 1:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Tuesday everyone, watch out 4 more days until Khaili drives, get off the road JK,, she is a great driver..:)\r\n    CUPS\r\n    Please don’t put the water cups out for the hot water cups, they will not work…\r\n    Gerard will be dropping more hot cups off today\r\n    Coffee center\r\n    Please make sure that the coffee center is always full of items, we never want it to look empty\r\n    Flowers\r\n    This is a pet peeve I hate seeing dead flowers in the lobby, please remove them, no flowers are better then dead ones.\r\n    Lots of complaints from the weekend regarding having no air conditioning during our heat wave, I cannot stress this enough, please please please tell every guest making reservation during a possible warm time that we only have air conditioning in some rooms,, most people expect A/C and it is up to us to tell them the specifics so please do so.\r\n    Reservations\r\n    I have noticed that not all reservations have all the information in it, like address or phone number or 3 digit security code, it is important to gather all information that the form asks.\r\n    Trip Advisor\r\n    Great job on all the great reviews, remember we will tally the results at the end of the month, and pay out at that time. Way to go everyone..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 1:59 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all.\r\n\r\n    Nothing to crazy to report. The weather had a lot of people coming and going from the office to escape from the random rain.\r\n    - Bike #5 need to be taken over to Paul’s. I didn’t get a good look at it but the rear wheel is not turning freely. I put behind the office by my porch.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it really. Everything else was just the usual craziness. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2008 at 1:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a fair weekend.. Did you all get enough Fair to last you another year? I was lucky enough (JK) to see one of the rides (the ZIPPER) have one of the cages fall half off of the track while someone was in it. That was freaky, and of course I stood at the bottom of the ride while I made sure none of my ride going kids were on that crazy ride.\r\n    DELL\r\n    I ordered 2 more cartridges for the drum and I ordered some more ink. We should have plenty for now, BUT when you use the last one on the shelf PLEASE tell me so I can order some more.\r\n    What is up with the lighting and thunder, I kinda feel like I am back in Hawaii:) What a nice thought…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2008 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    I ordered four cases of 8oz cups(as per Cindy) so we won’t run out for a while HOWEVER, when we start running low we need to reorder them ASAP.\r\n    Thats all for now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all just some slight random FYI’s\r\n\r\n    - Please make sure housekeeping changes the sheets in 322. Apparently they’re “nubby” and the guests don’t like them. Not really sure what’s going on but they would like fresh sheets. Thanks.\r\n\r\n    - Just a reminder that 114 has a 1pm check-out per Steffi. It should be on the housekeeping report…\r\n\r\n    - We are out of the little 8oz paper cups we use in the lobby. Gerard says that he always keeps them in stock so if someone could please call him in the morning to see if he can bring a box or two over when he comes to take our regular orders on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n    - Coffee has been ordered from SJCRC. They should bring it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    - Someone need to go the grocery store to get some sugar. We are out.\r\n\r\n    - The front desk’s copy of the bike lock key has gone missing. Gio said that we had it Sunday morning but it disappeared by the time I got to work. Perhaps someone accidentally has it in a back pocket? Keep your eyes out for it. We are currently stealing Gio’s cafe copy.\r\n\r\n    I think that’s about it… whew.. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Front Desk Printer\r\n\r\n    The generic brand drum replacement Gerard brought us suddenly died tonight. We put map paper in the back printer so print to Steffi’s desk. I think wee need to order an official drum replacement directly from Dell. The generic brand one worked for a time, even though the “replace drum” light still blinked while we were using it. Must just not be compatible enough… ah well. Hopefully Cindy can order a new one first thing in the morning and we can get it in a day to so.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 8:30 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN….room 321 is leaving for a kayaking trip and will be returning on Friday, can you please go grab their 4 bags (they are leaving the bags in their room because they are leaving before 8) and store them in the luggage room? Thank you!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2008 at 6:04 pm\r\n\r\n    112\r\n    I o.k.ed a 1 PM check out for those guys tomorrow, see WRP notes. Please let HK know:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hoookay….\r\n\r\n    Lot’s of room canceling, moving and booking excitement tonight.\r\n\r\n    - We no longer have a hold room for Saturday. A guest called us and told us he *just* noticed that he booked the reservation for the wrong date. It was booked for tonight but he meant it to be for Saturday. We had to give him our last Emergency hold room for Sat. Thankfully we were able to sell his room for tonight. He is trying to blame us for booking the wrong date even though he did it online. (Go figure) So what this boils down to is that if you get any cancellations for Saturday you might just want to hold on to it. Just in case.\r\n\r\n    - The guest in 337 is a very nice old woman and VERY hard of hearing. She’s here for 10 days and so far we’ve had to tell twice to turn down the TV. :) I wonder if we can find some headphones for her…\r\n\r\n    - The Sea Port folks are going to want us to take their luggage down to the marina in the morning. They will probably elect a person to go with the luggage. They should be coming by around 11am, perhaps a little after.\r\n\r\n    Well That’s it. I’m OUTTA HERE!!!!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    We had several incidents (one just today) where guests booked massage treatments right after they think they arrive with the ferry, but then they miss the ferry or the ferry is late and everything goes haywire. So just to reiterate: please let our guests know how full the ferries are this time of the year, make sure they know that the spa will charge them for a missed appointment, encourage guests to play it safe, have their treatment the morning after they arrive.\r\n    Also: Ceily complained that some adventure providers pick up our guests right by the spa and having their big trucks idle right there under the spa windows. If you see that, please go out there and ask the adventure provider or cab driver politely to pull in by the lobby or wait for our guests a little away from the spa.\r\n    Gracias!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 2:18 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a reservation in the new bookings section from UNIREZ that is not to be confirmed, it has a invalid credit card and we are waiting for them to call back with a new one until we do confirm it.\r\n    It is friday! ONE more week until I get my license.. and become the official Jacob, Dylan and Friends chauffeur. haha :D\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend. See you on Monday.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Rez # 1260611\r\n    Will be moving to room 302 tomorrow and will want their luggage moved over.\r\n\r\n    Guest asked me to scan and e-mail some pages for him but I couldn’t get the scanner to do it so I just made him some copies maybe someone can try again in the morning.\r\n\r\n    that about it not a whole lot going on tonight\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey I just remembered something. When you click on “more photos” in the Wind Place department nothing happens. I had a guest comment on it when I was up at E last weekend.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Yes.. I did pass my written. :)\r\n    Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n    Not too much to talk about. Elena has her blogging list going so we combined lists.\r\n    See you in the morning! I’m off to the fair.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot Chocolate\r\n    The extra is kept in the Orca Storage room, Stefan has refilled the coffee service area for now.\r\n    Pepsi Machine by Pool\r\n    Pepsi will be here on Tuesday to fix and fill the machine\r\n    Bikes are fixed and back on the property, please remember to bring them directly over to the bike shop when they are not working\r\n    Khaili\r\n    YAHHHHH, Khaili passed her written, one more step to go and then I will have a VERY responsible chauffeur :) JK (kinda)\r\n    Well done Ms. Khaili\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Starting September 2, Cafe Zia will be closed Monday thru Thursday. Natailya will be in the coffee shop Friday, Saturday and Sunday and will be helping Raquel in HSK 2 days a week.\r\n    Keep up the GREAT work everyone, we are at the tail end of Summer..\r\n    Smile,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2008 at 11:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    Released our emergency room around 6:00, not sold.\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Maya’s called us back late tonight and said that he’s sorry but all sold out for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    POST\r\n    Tori called in tonight to change the address on the package on the back desk. I filled out a Post form for it, so it’s all ready to go.\r\n\r\n    TEA AREA\r\n    Does anyone know where there is some hot chocolate?? Morgan said there were two boxes ordered but we don’t know where they went. I filled the spot with extra apple cider and then borrowed some instant coffees from the housekeeping room.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2008 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing exciting.\r\n    Just getting my blogging fix of the day.\r\n    Okay, good night :D\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    USEFUL INFORMATION\r\n    Found out today that Bob’s Taxi isn’t officially open until 6:00 am. They will do rides before by arrangement, but they said there is an added $15.00 fee.\r\n\r\n    301\r\n    The wall sconce light bulb is out. I wrote it up in a maintenance request form, but maybe Regino could replace it before the next guest checks in.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Bike numbers’ 4 & 17 tires are flat. They need new tubes. I will try to get them over to Paul’s in the morning.\r\n\r\n    The computer in the lobby is having a problem staying connected. I had to reconnect it to the lobby network several times tonight. I finally put the computer up on the table to try and get a better signal. So far so good but remember to tell Chris about it tomorrow. He might know a better way.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it I guess. See you all bright and early.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Open Rooms\r\n\r\n    Well we’ve just had a rash of cancellations and room moveings so we now have several rooms open for Wednesday and Thursday this week. I have informed the FHH and they will try to send people this way. BR has been told too. This week’s going to be a crazy one. w00t!! Fair time!!\r\n\r\n    Please keep in mind we have a couple of hold rooms on tap for every day this week. We are sold out for Friday and Saturday but we have 2 Emerg. Rooms held for each day. Lets sellout every day this week!!! Go Team! The Fighting ELEMENTONIANS.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing this morning. Except this really weird 911 call. It said that rm 803 made the call according to the phone console. BUT when the cop came by, he said that the 4351 number(fax) had been calling them consistently. So weird. Anyways, nothing was wrong, everyone was fine. Just very weird.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty.. well, I am off for the day. See you tomorrow :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 10:56 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much to say tonight. Left a couple of alarms.\r\n\r\n    - Just to let you know that we now have 2 rooms open for tomorrow. Reservations #1141644 and #1141673 needed to leave a day early. While I am certain we’ll sell the room I did not want to credit them for the night until we do. So please if you sell any one of the two rooms, please credit their accounts. Thanks!!\r\n\r\n    - Also remember we have 308 on emergency hold.\r\n\r\n    - We haven’t heard back from Jessica the Hideaway housekeeper. Therefore our blanket is still missing in action. Please try to give her another call in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! See you all at 1!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    will not be in the office on Monday. Please call her at home or on her cell if you guys need something (”I’m hungry, are we there yet?”)\r\n\r\n    SEA & SKY\r\n    We had several missed sea & sky packages this weekend, scramble scramble, all kayak tours sold out, FHH & STEPS having private parties, Back Door Kitchen completely sold out, scramble, scramble…\r\n    Please, guys, when you have a little down time (that is: before you check your personal email), double check upcoming reservations. Do it for the sanity of your coworkers.\r\n\r\n    BL (BEAUTIFUL LAURA)\r\n    Supplied us with half a metric ton of organic fair trade chocolate today. Yeah! It’s nestled in the Fresh Mouth Emporium. Thank you!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    LOST BRACELET!!\r\n    Found in the Van Today! It’s put away in E envelope in the Drawer in the back desk that is below The one that says Steffi! I have put my dibs on it if there is no claim :D !!\r\n    It went very smoothly! I am near my way out to my weekend! I will see all you in a few days!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin All!\r\n    Lots of folks doing laundry tonight after the designated hours. I think we may need to remake/add more signs in the laundry room so we can keep our folks in 332 as happy as possible.\r\n\r\n    - The folks in the Hideaway came up late looking for another blanket. I gave them a grayish, cream colored fleece blanket from housekeeping. Please make sure you call Jessica in the morning so we can make sure to get it back. One of us may just need to walk down there in the morning to collect it.\r\n\r\n    -Also there is a box in the back of gifts that need to go into room #326 tomorrow before they check in.\r\n\r\n    -Tory!(my favorite guy to work with) just kidding Morgan hadn’t sent this and so I thought I would be silly. No but anyway I just did a ton of pretty vouchers and straightened the basket out. Please try to keep it this way I was inspired when I had to do a last minute voucher and everything was in a big knot of vouchers, covers, envelopes, ribbon and wax sticky things but all mixed up. Bye E see you next week. Goin on my well needed days of for some R&R. I really should have just put this under Tory Says: but I thought I’d be cute for once.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing today so far. It is such a pleasure working with my extremely competent and sweet coworkers.\r\n\r\n    MONDAY\r\n    I brought 2 espresso machines up from BR, please give them to the UPS guy on Monday. There is also a small package for Post San Juan on my desk. Please take care of that as well.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2008 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    What a warm welcome from my distant relatives up here at E. hugs and all. Screams from the balconies in all different languages. A man was actually yelling for his son named Cory and I was so caught up in my popularity that I thought it was someone calling for me. Some faces I haven’t seen in months. It’s good to be back. Nice night with Morgan and Steffi. But I do miss my girls at B.R.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2008 at 12:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Bottle openers are in! I put them in the drawer.\r\n\r\n    The “no show” from last night was actually supposed to be a canceled reservation. They had two separate reservations and they were both supposed to be canceled but the second one didn’t. That being said we have a sky place open for tonight and tomorrow night.\r\n\r\n    I called the housekeepers and they didn’t know anythings about the watch. They said that they would call back in a few.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 10:40 pm\r\n\r\n    REZ # 1246647 thinks that they may have left their Fossil watch with blue face in the room when they checked out please ask housekeeping and call them back.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, I’m back!\r\n    Sounds like you all had a rather eventful week. Way to go, my resourceful ELEMENTONIONS!\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Has a spanking new water heater.\r\n\r\n    WINE BOTTLE OPENERS\r\n    are ordered\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    I’ll make a new schedule this weekend (Saturday). Let me know about day-off wishes and such. Also: Please let me know when you are going back to school (Khaili & Elena) or leaving us (sniff).\r\n\r\n    TO-DO\r\n    Please double check adventure & massage voucher invoices (in my box).\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 12:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday:)\r\n    Well done yesterday team…\r\n    Welcome back Steffi..\r\n    It was a rough start this morning, BUT things are up and going as normal as can be…\r\n    Back office/Steffi’s desk\r\n    The desk in Steffi’s office HAS to be cleaned off at ALL times, the paper cutter can stay there but nothing else. Please look to your left when you are walking through the door way in there, Tuesday I found packages of things that had been delivered to the hotel via UPS and no one bothered to see where they went they just stacked them up. If you are not sure ask me, usually I know what’s been ordered.\r\n    It is almost SJC Fair time..\r\n    Have fun,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 8:05 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n\r\n    I’m back. And rested.\r\n\r\n    Printer is good. There was a cord in the way of the tray (that rhymes) but it is ready to rock now.\r\n\r\n    That is all for now. For some reason I felt the urge to write a blog about ‘fixing’ the printer…\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2008 at 10:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Well as Khaili said it was INSANE no other way to put it, just everything that could go wrong, did. The only good thing that happened was the internet kicking back on at around 8:30, oh and having Khaili around to help wasn’t bad either J/K.\r\n    ZZ ZZZ ZZ\r\n    Just a few things to pass on for now…\r\n    ZZZ ZZ\r\n    Room Service…\r\n    What do we do with the signed slip? I had one tonight, which for now is in cash drawer 1.\r\n    ZZ ZZZ\r\n    Invoices…\r\n    Although we did have that small printer at the guest desk it just wasn’t fast enough to handle the number of copies we needed so there may be several people asking for invoices tomorrow.\r\n    ZZZZ\r\n    Printer…\r\n    The front desk printer paper tray is not wanting to close all the way I kept fiddling with it but couldn’t get anywhere with it maybe in the morning someone can figure it out?\r\n    ZZZ ZZZZZ\r\n    That is all I can remember for now. I’m sure I’ve forgotten something but my brain is off for the night.\r\n\r\n    I’m off to catch some ZZZZZ’s\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2008 at 9:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Great news: I got my car today! And the internet is up. I will NEVER in my life again take the internet for granted.\r\n\r\n    Other news:\r\n\r\n    Well, basically is was insane. No other way to put it. I’m not going into details, but I’m ready for a great nights sleep. Not anything to pass on. I don’t think that I am making sense….\r\n\r\n    Good night.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All\r\n\r\n    Firstly, we need more pens in the office. there like gold in here and our supply is low.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, a booking happened again for the wrong dates. However this time we were completely sold out and so was every SINGLE other place on the ENTIRE island. Anyways after many many many phone calls, we reached an agreement that they would be in the Orca room w/o a shower. But as we were arranging that BW called and under their owners permission opened a room up that was under maintenence. So i guess all’s well that ends well. :) Let this also be a reminder to us that we absolutely NEED to have emergency rooms on hold!\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow im off to beat ferry traffic and enjoy the sun on Orca’s island. See you soon!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    TechieChris Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2008 at 5:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everybody! TechieChris here – Just wanted to let everyone know that I made the Guest Computer at Elements able to print to the Brother Printer next to Steffi’s desk. Also, the server (the computer in the back corner of the front desk) will also print, but to the Dell printer at the front counter.\r\n\r\n    I am trying to find out where the weak spots are for the WiFi – any time someone complains about it working poorly or not at all, please note their room! Very important for me to know where the bad spots are.\r\n\r\n    One more thing – the Lobby Wireless has a new password ’sunshine’ just like the property-wide.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day!\r\n\r\n    Chris\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2008 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    Lots of stuff going on.\r\n\r\n    MORNING SHIFT\r\n\r\n    -theres an envelope in the back with information on a group folio that i tried to book. it was for a man and his family, to get the payment on one bill i tried to folio it. Please check it out #11330. I have the credit card info inside the envelope. Im not sure if it was saved in the folio or not. Please double check it for me and then give the man a call back on his local # before 10:00.\r\n\r\n    -Western Prince should call back about books for a party of 8 #1251307. Please confirm with them if they do.\r\n\r\n    -guests in 203 are very upset about the wi-fi having a low signal in there room. Cindy knows about it, they will most likely be in this morning trying to talk to her. we left a message with Chris.\r\n\r\n    -room 202 had no remote. i gave them a remote to try and set. when i went up to the room shortly after no one answered when i knocked. they are a stay over so lets try and get this taken care off.\r\n\r\n    -there are two phone messages that need to be returned, after taking care of wine openers, pool towels, tvs, bikes, by the time i got back in the office (a half hour later) there were three messages. it was 10:00 by then and didn’t want to disrupt them.\r\n\r\n    OTHER STUFF\r\n\r\n    -the phone on the back desk was in room 203. It was broken and would not ring. Raquel switched it out with another phone.\r\n\r\n    -there are also two items that need to be brought up to post san juan. i believe we need more information on the white bag.\r\n\r\n    -where did all of our wine openers go???? at one point we had none, and then i found one in housekeeping and had 3 different people use it. this makes me think we should have people check them out, or simply only let them open wine in the front office with our wine openers. basically, we need more wine openers once again.\r\n\r\n    See you this afternoon.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2008 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Whooo…. Khaili wasn’t kidding. Phones were all over the place tonight.\r\n    - We are sold out for tomorrow. WooHoo! There is still one Emergency room. Let’s hope we can sell it an not use it for an emergency. :)\r\n    - We are in need of some more Spa/Dining vouchers. I will try to print some out tomorrow and we can try to whip some up.\r\n    - I ordered more hot cocoa on Saturday. It should hopefully get here tomorrow.\r\n    - The gift basket from SJO has now been almost completely ransacked. Poor thing never had a chance. *sniff* Those Sunday front desk girls are a force to be reckoned with. :D\r\n    - Our in room hair dryers (the kind that mount on the wall) have been dropping like flies this weekend. I had half a dozen calls today alone about people having problems with them. Either not working or the reset buttons repeatedly tripping. We may have to swap them out for more traditional style hair dryers.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. See you all in the mornin’\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2008 at 9:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much.. again.\r\n\r\n    Phones were crazy. That’s about it :) haha. My dad is rushing me.\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning everybody! I hope we’re all bright-eyed and bushy tailed.\r\n\r\n    - Yes please read the notes for #1215689. He wants to talk to Cindy directly and he know she won’t be here until Monday. I was holding room 114 for them in case they wanted to move but they never got back to me. Khaili left them messages but I guess they were out to dinner. If they come to you looking for a place to shower in the morning you can always offer them that room. Give them a late check out too if they want. Ugh. Sorry.\r\n\r\n    - Brian and the fine folks at San Juan Outfitters dropped off a lovely goodie basket for us all. Along with the fruit and chocolates there are also some Red Bull’s in the fridge. Have fun with those. I ain’t touchin’ ‘em. :)\r\n\r\n    - Due to the fact that we are filling up quite quickly for this entire week (YAY!), I have made a series of Emergency hold rooms for the upcoming days. You will find them on the Unit Maintenance section. We still have a few Water places most of the days but we are sold out of 2 queen rooms. I have put at least 1-2 Earth places on hold just in case. I will be sure to release them if everything is going well. So far we have used every hold room every weekend for mishaps and incorrect bookings. :( Not always our fault thankfully.\r\n\r\n    - Adam, is it possible to get some pictures of the Hideaway up on the reservation screen? I have noticed that near 60-70% of the time most folks we check in there are unhappy because they were expecting our decor style. We often have to use our emergency hold rooms to bring them here because they don’t like the room. We all try to describe the room to people over the phone when making reservations but a lot of reso’s come in as last minute online bookings. I know your out of town but perhaps when you get back, unwound, and caught up on the mound of other things I am sure you have to do? :) I think it’ll make our guest’s lives easier. Thanks so much.\r\n\r\n    That’s it. Call me if you have questions. You know me, I never sleep. :D\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 8:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all-\r\n    I haven’t written for a while.. I really need to start remembering.\r\n    So- a little bit of an incident tonight. I would recommend reading the remarks in reservation #1215689 for all the info.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, not much going on. We are sold out! Woohoo! August is filling up pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n    Okay, well I am about to head home.. to my lonely house.. :( Thank you, family (Cindy) for leaving me. Juust kidding.\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 8:02 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all. Nothing much to report for last night. The High Noon folks were getting faxes like they were going out of style. Just a reminder that we have to rooms on Emergency hold. Please try not to release them unless you really need to. We’ll take a look at things a little later in the afternoon and release them then if everything going alright. Please call me if you are having problems today. I’ll be in at 3. Let’s hope everything goes smoothly. (knock knock) Laterz!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 1st, 2008 at 5:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow…8/2 Lavendera has a 10:30 massage available as well as a few reflexology appointments open. Please let anyone interested know!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    August 1st, 2008 at 2:11 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG: the computer upstairs is still not working. i called techi chris to see if he was able to stop by today. friday. left a message.\r\n\r\n    unable to send espresso machines today. aeronautical would not come to pick up. they said we needed to drop them off. their office hours are monday- friday 7-3pm. can someone with a car do this monday? or if they drop off anything…like a new computer….trade them.\r\n\r\n    thanks lilly for taking my shift monday. you are on the schedule officially.\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    I am the remote control queen!! Hehe…It took me about 3 separate tries and about 15 minutes of instruction reading and I got 112’s remote working…woohoo! I think we all could use a little tutorial on those things, they are not as easy as they seem! PS- there have been a lot of guests calling in lately saying their rooms either a) don’t have a remote, or b)their remote doesn’t work. Can we talk to Raquel or Regino and have them always have the housekeepers make sure there is a remote in the rooms and that it works?? It would save us non-techie people a lot of confusion!!\r\n\r\n    A pretty slow night…the rain is keeping everyone locked up in their rooms. The jazz was so cool tonight, the people were very talented…\r\n\r\n    We’ve had some late-night pool goers lately…how are people getting in after 10? It looks like the pool is empty and then they just appear out of nowhere…hmmmm.\r\n\r\n    Khai…please call housekeeping tomorrow morning and ask Raquel if they have found a Boston Red Sox hat in room 341 or 342 in the last few days. Thank you missy!\r\n\r\n    Hopefully the sun will come out tomorrow, I am crossing my fingers!! See you all at 1…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2008 at 7:09 pm\r\n\r\n    BUSY, BUSY, BUSY\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    I went through upcoming reservation and made a whole bunch of alarms to follow through. None of them are super urgent, so don’t get a heart attack tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n    DAS ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Morgan, please double check all EH rooming lists (in your box).\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS\r\n    Will be here again next Wednesday again, Regino will do the luggage handling on Wednesday at 3 and Thursday at 11:15 (Cindy: luggage fee not added yet).\r\n\r\n    JAZZ\r\n    Was very nice, a couple of guests sat on the couch and listened.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there, Sweeties, I will send you strength from the forest to get through the weekend:)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 10:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK\r\n    Please tell housekeeping about the two lost item requests , they are next to the front desk phone with description and contact info.\r\n\r\n    LOCALS\r\n    Tonight i had the liberty of kicking two local smucks out of the pool house (ahem..Cody and Mariah round two). Khaili and i had scene them before but they came back again. The moment i spotted his car in the back parking lot i found them all cozy in OUR hottub. i went in and told them whats up. if them come back, which i dont think they will, lets call the cops!!\r\n\r\n    Other than that its been quite here in Element Land\r\n\r\n    ps. i am soooo excited my cell phone came!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BELOW BIRD ROCK BLOG\r\n    (it does that thing again where it says: Your comment is awaiting moderation and it’s not showing up, mhm)\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    FOOD FUTURE\r\n    Elena will order produce tomorrow, which we need to pick up on Friday. Kaitlyn or Tory, can one of you get a check from Cindy and head on up to MP for pick up, please? Buy some bananas and anything else we might need to get through the weekend.\r\n\r\n    Lilly will pick up the Food Coop order next Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    I’m in the woods. Please buy food as needed (there is some cash in the safe in an envelope with my name on it, write down what you take). Please contact Cindy if something big happens. Have a great week:)\r\n\r\n    # Steffi Says: Your comment is awaiting moderation.\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 1:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn & Lilly: you two switching shifts is totally fine with me. Thanks for letting me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 5:33 pm\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS DEPARTURE THURSDAY\r\n    Please tell Regino first thing in the morning that Backroads would like their luggage handled at 11:15 AM, all goes back in their van, except the luggage from room 104, that goes in the lobby (guest is leaving via Victoria Express).\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 1:41 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER CREDIT CARD\r\n    The guest who left his credit card(on back desk by bike forms) was a clipper guest (therefore we don’t have contact info). Clipper will call guest, guest will call us, please get address so we can send his card back.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 11:31 am\r\n\r\n    Well done everyone:) I am so PROUD of the Trip Advisor review we received. BRAVO…\r\n    Gio\r\n    Please take it easy, we will all as a team help you through the next 4 weeks, please call me up front if you need any help with luggage or anything else.\r\n    Phone system\r\n    We are getting there, the night forwarding is working but the day forwarding is not, (or I should say it is sporadic) so please get every phone call you can by the 4th ring.\r\n    Evening Magazine\r\n    Thanks everyone for all your effort in making sure this event went smoothly. I really appreciate all you did. The show will air tonight at 7pm on channel 5, I think Priscilla may be on air..\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Steffi will be gone this weekend, YAHHHH off to the woods and a well deserved break from the craziness. Enjoy yourself. If you need anything call Morgan and then me.\r\n    MUSIC by the Pool\r\n    Enjoy yourself tomorrow night from 5:30 to 7:30 PM, we will have live music at the pool patio. Open to the public, tell all your friends.\r\n    Phone Charges\r\n    The phone charges are still not fixed, when a guest in house calls “0″ after hours and it gets transfered to Frontline. Please delete those charges when you see them.\r\n    Thanks again for all your wonderful help.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning everybody! So if anybody wonders what these green bags are doing in the back office some guests that went on a kayaking trip left them here for SJO to pick up. And also Chris came yesterday and fixed the lobby wireless. So no more problems. And he also changed the password to “sunshine” so now both the Elements Wi-Fi and the Elements lobby have the same one. Thats it for now.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 9:42 am\r\n\r\n    For all you Hazelnut coffee drinkers…..I have called island paper, and put in an order for the Classic Hazelnut syrup, and sending the ” New and Improved”, BACK!! It should be here on friday! YEAH!! Also, we have here a Credit card with a bike release for that looks like its been here for a couple of days. Does anyone know what this is??\r\n    I HAVE A INJURY :( :(\r\n    Yesterday morning I woke up and felt GREAT, then about an hour later, I had a shooting pain in the middle of my neck. Shortly after that i noticed that I was loosing my vision in my right eye!! (SCARY)A few seconds after that I had lost about 80% of my vision out of my right eye. So I called my uncle doc. in a panic. He told me that it sounded like I was getting a visual migraine. I ended up spending all day at the doctors and the optimoligist. They want me to take it easy for 6 weeks. No lifting over 20 lbs. I have to go in 4 weeks from now. They are running a few tests. Might have a detaching retina (spelling??)WHAAHHH i am freaked out! So Luggage, I will need help. Sorry, I will do the best I can.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    All check ins here tonight.\r\n\r\n    SOLD OUT for this Saturday night. YAY!\r\n\r\n    ONE PROBLEM\r\n    Unirez booked a room that is unavailable for this saturday night. I wasn’t sure how to deal with this so i left it for you morgan.\r\n\r\n    Ill be here to cover your shift at 10:30 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Im off to go fix a tv and go home to bed.\r\n\r\n    xo\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    lilly: do you want to take my shift on monday the 4th at bird rock? 3-11? i could go for a day off…. let me know via bird rock log. thanks (we need to clear it with steffi too.)\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 7:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool Info\r\n\r\n    I forgot to mention earlier that when I went to do the pool this morning that the breaker on the pool heater was popped and need to be reset. From the look of the temp in the pool the heater hadn’t been working for at least 2 days. I have reset the breaker but it will take a bit for the temp to get back up. I’ll keep you posted if anything else is happening. Temp was at ~70 this morning so it’ll take a day or so to get it back to the normal 80.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Ugh….so the line that comes in from rooms trying to call the front desk is forwarding to front line after like two rings….is this supposed to happen?\r\n\r\n    Anyway, so if anyone needs a day off or needs anyone to cover a shift next week, I am looking for hours on Monday and Tuesday the 4th and 5th and I would be more than happy to pick up anyone’s shift…just let me know!\r\n\r\n    Also…we are way low on coffee cups, so I stole a few from Cafe Zia, sorry Gio and Nataliya! Raquel said that she ordered some for us, but we don’t know when they are coming. In the meantime, can someone run down to Kings and grab a pack of 8oz cups, we only have a few left and I’m sure they will be gone soon!\r\n\r\n    Anyway, have a good Monday everyone, see you on Tuesday!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder…don’t forget to ALWAYS suppress pricing on clipper reservations. Thanks guys!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    You guys are so sweet.\r\n\r\n    PHONE CHARGES\r\n    When guests call the operator and nobody picks up, the system routes them to the call center and then charges them for the call (it’s always the same 801 number). Please delete those charges. Phone Bob will be back tomorrow and fix that (I talked to him).\r\n\r\n    340\r\n    needs cleaning, moved guest to a different room, please make sure HK knows\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY\r\n    We’ll have a Backroads group arriving on Wednesday. Please make a rooming list, prepare a remote check in and make keys for that group. They’ll arrives at 3. Stefan will load their luggage from their van into their rooms. Regino will do the luggage handling for them on Thursday at noon.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up, guest starring Amazing Elena & Extraordinary Tory in “night shifts” here at ELEMENTS & Lovely Lilly in a special appearance as “breakfasts queen” down at Bird Rock. RE: Seattle girl getaway: Tue 8/19 & Wed 8/20 would work better schedule wise.\r\n\r\n    Great job everybody, each and every one of you rocks my world.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    What a crazy day!! I have been lucky enough to have a pretty quiet night though…but oh my what would we have done without Steffi earlier! Steffi, you are amazing…I would never be able to do what you did.\r\n\r\n    #1103356 NO SHOW…I charged him and printed out the invoice and made keys. I called and left a message but his phone is off.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it…see you at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    ROMANCE\r\n    Today was the second Romance package in 3 days we had no record of whatsoever. I believe after processing the reservation WRP defaulted back to “no romance”. Therefore it is crucial to print out all online reservations, circle the add-on requested, double check the basket and organize the add-ons for guests. Due to uncanny teamwork all was good though.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We had 4 clipper reservation trying to check-in today and we had no record of them, we never got a fax from Clipper, but one of us must have released the block. Luckily we found room at the BW for those guests, one of them not happy at all, understandingly. If any of those guests wish to use our pool or check out bikes, by all means, let them (their names are on a clipper voucher copy in Cindy’s box).\r\n    What did we learn from that? Never ever release the clipper block without a clipper fax on hand.\r\n\r\n    201\r\n    Guests will go on 3 day kayak trip. They’ll leave before our office opens. They’ll have their bags packed and luggage tagged in the room. Please have HK bring the bags into our luggage room.\r\n\r\n    But let’s not dwell on the negative. Gio sold 12 cinnamon buns in 5 minutes this morning, old friends are having a glass of wine by the pool, little girls with brand new stuffed animals are sneaking their 4th hot chocolate while mom isn’t looking, lovers are holding hands in the hot tub, it’s summer!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 4:26 pm\r\n\r\n    OOOOhhhh MY!!\r\n    I think that we all survived today! A few things…\r\n\r\n    Susie’s Mopeds:\r\n    Carmen called today and said that All guests have to MAke Reservations for any kind of rentals that they offer. Only because we sent some guests down yesterday, and there was nothing for them them when they got there. They were let down a little.. So just tell the guests that it would be a great idea for them to call and reserve!\r\n\r\n    Sunday tomorrow, I hope that it is a smooth day :) Good night ladies! ZZZzzzzz….\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Priscilla! I hope your mouth is starting to feel better…\r\n\r\n    #1227151 canceled at the last minute, I called her to see if they were on the late ferry and just heard back from her saying that she was really sorry she hadn’t called but her child got very sick and so they wouldn’t be able to make it. I only charged her the 10% because I figured the situation was out of her hands….\r\n\r\n    That’s about all….I hope your day goes well, see you at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 5:39 pm\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING AT NIGHT (PART XXXXIIIII)\r\n    Tonight, simply press “function” and then “F3″ (like we used to) to put phones through to Frontline. All lines, plus the operator line will be forwarded. Yeah. Thank you phone Bob for making it so easy for us.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Just ordered coffee from SJ Coffee.\r\n\r\n    ITS CRAZY TODAY!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 9:56 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    Thanks for my little note, Lilly :)\r\n    So, I have been MIA the past few days. I had softball camp the past three days and that didn’t go as planned. First day I ended up messing up my back so I had to sit on the bench and watch the other two days. Not very much fun… :(\r\n    And now, I’m leaving early today to take on my captain duties for Relay for Life.\r\n    If any of you are interested, PLEASE stop by at relay. It is going to be soo neat. It is incredible how many people are there. I would definitely recommend stopping by, especially after dark. The whole track is lite up by candles. It is awesome. I could ramble about it all day :)\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is it for this morning. Just wanted to say hello.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Bye Morgan, have fun, we’ll take good care of our tub, thanks for the spa 101 class.\r\n    Thank you so much, Dave for, fixing it so quick.\r\n    Thank you, Regino, for being the van king all day today. Wow, busy busy busy.\r\n\r\n    WASHER\r\n    The newer washer is out of order (spin cycle issues), Seth is trying to reach a fixing person, just so you all know.\r\n\r\n    LOOK INTO THE FUTURE\r\n    Whenever you are idle, go through upcoming reservations and make sure we have no loose ends. Also look at the availability calendar and make sure we don’t have any over bookings (rooms UNIREZ “creates”, but don’t have a room assigned). If you catch one of those, let me know asap.\r\n\r\n    Be strong and calm and kind and eat your fresh mouth emporium offers. Much Love.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2008 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Ok pool news.\r\n\r\n    Well everything is looking good so far. I will give the hot tub a once over right before I leave. It mostly just needs to warm up. The pool should be fine for while I am gone. The big thing people are going to need to keep an eye on is the water levels. The pool should be ok unless there is a whole mess of people slashing all over the place. The hot tub though, needs to be filled almost once a day. The most important thing is to keep the water level over the top of the intake on the side. There is a small hose hanging on side of the shelf in the chem room. You just need to hook it up to the faucet on the outside wall and let it run a bit. It’s about 10min per inch of water. If you all could be responsible for keeping an eye on the level (perhaps you lovely cafe ladies?) Steffi knows how to add water, as well as Seth and Regino. It’s not too hard :) . I will have my cell so please call me if you have any questions. I will be reachable almost the entire time although I don’t know how well I will have service in Blaine. But I will try not to leave you hanging. BYE!!!!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2008 at 2:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Good evening everyone!\r\n    Room 118 if someone could get a hold of the guest to see if Seth could go in and quickly fix the bathroom ceiling fan! AWESOME! I received a package from visions espresso…..with the grinder part Laura and I have been waiting for…..I was so exited until……..THEY SENT ME THE WRONG FREAKING MODEL PARTS!!!!!! They sent me the home version and not the commercial version. ERRRGHHHHH…I think that will be the time I go through them! To many mix ups, and non shipments! Sorry Laura! I called Rancilio and left a message to go through them and get the right parts ASAP! Thats my project for now. Soon we will get you you’re grinder back :(\r\n    I think that is all folks! Chao\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Ohaiyo gozaimasu miina-san! Genki desu ka? Honto ne? Yosh! Ikimasu!\r\n\r\n    Jut a few things for the morning:\r\n\r\n    #1234758 need to have massages confirmed w/ the spa. I had spoken to Dana right before she closed and the times were available. They need 3 separate 60min Swedish massages at 5:15 on 8/16. The names of all three of the ladies getting the treatments are in the rez.\r\n\r\n    Steffi, those folks who had all the massage treatments you booked; I can’t get a hold of them. I have called everyday and left a message on the number you left.\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub update. Just so you all know the story. When I came in to to my usual daily check-up there was water spraying out the side of the hot tub filter pump. Not the pipe but the actual pump itself. It is shut down because without that pump we can’t run the heater. Rob is calling his distributors and is trying to get a new pump here as fast has he can. Please tell people that we are really sorry about the breakdown. Because we are on an island it’s sometimes hard to get specialized equipment here in a timely manner. So… Bottom line. The hot tub could open tomorrow or in a week. It’ll take as long as it takes. :( Not the best time for me to be gone for a few days is it? Sorry.\r\n\r\n    Oh and in case anyone is wondering. I did order Hot Cocoa from Sysco on Sunday. We should hopefully get it soon.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s it for me tonight. Arigatou Gozaimasu! Oyasumi Nasai!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Afternoon! So nothing too eventful this morning…the Victoria Clipper called and I told them that we will have to charge them for #1126345 even though she left a day early.\r\n\r\n    #1217810 canceled her kayaking trip this morning with Outdoor Odysseys and I told her that we have to still charge her because of OO’s cancellation policy. She was totally fine with that.\r\n\r\n    Broken foot man canceled his reservation w/ us and I called SJO and canceled his kayaking as well.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, there’s not a whole lot that went on this morning.\r\n\r\n    See you guys on Thursday!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 11:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin All! Just a couple of little things.\r\n\r\n    - Room 106 borrowed a laundry basket from the laundry room. They are leaving early so please let Raquel know it’s in there.\r\n\r\n    - Reservation numbers 1225254 and 1232154 were no-shows. Please charge them accordingly in the morning.\r\n\r\n    - Victoria Clipper reservation #1126345 is checking out day early. Please read the notes I left in the rez.\r\n\r\n    - Reservation #1232035 is checking out on the 24th and had put something from the gift shop on his room. I noticed late last night that we don’t have his card saved on file. We always need to make sure we save the card number when you make a new reservation. :)\r\n\r\n    - A very light, minor, caffeine-free, diet-gripe. I know it’s busy for the morning people. But please, if you can, try to remember to check all the guests out. That way when we have a rush at 3pm we aren’t getting errors from the system telling us that people are still checked into the room. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Congrats to Lilly on her new wheels. Makes me jealous. Say… Think I can borrow it for the weekend? :) (renting a car stinks)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    The ice machine is fixed. :)\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I have a call into WEBREZPRO, if you get a hold of Kyle I would really like to talk to him.\r\n    If any of you receive a call from WEBREZ, please pass them along to me.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    Me again\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    Call Kris at Western Prince\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 9:52 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    Steffi- The no shows last night.. I think you dealt with, but I put the invoices in your box just in case.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    Kyle from webrez called. You know the deal– I think. Number is 1-800-221-3429 ext 217\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 8:57 am\r\n\r\n    Good Monday Morning:)\r\n    I just want to let you all know what FABULOUS job you are all doing. Well done on the great Trip Advisor review. Let’s keep them coming.\r\n    Music\r\n    As Khaili said below, we are having a jazz singer come and play in the pool patio on Thursday July 31 from 5pm to 7pm. Tell all our guests that are checking in and making a reservation about it. Feel free to check out her myspace, it has a demo of her Music.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Stefan on Monday morning could you please take bike #6 over to the bike shop.\r\n    Laura and Adam\r\n    They are going to be out of town off and on for the rest of the month, please direct all issues for them to me or Steffi.\r\n    Thanks you all, I really appreciate what a great team you are. I just can’t say it enough…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 11:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Not too bad tonight. Except for the ferries being over an hour late after the 5:05.\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Rooms 334 and 339 were no shows at closing. We may need to talk to the folks in 101 because these are rooms made for their people. One of the names mentioned in the notes has his own room under his own name for last night. It’s all very confusing.\r\n\r\n    BIKE STUFF\r\n    One of the orange bike’s (I forgot to get the number) seat is all wonky. It seems that not only is it tilted way too far back but one of the springs has fallen through the retaining ring thus twisting the seat at a odd angle. I have but it up on my front porch to keep it out of circulation. Can we perhaps have Seth look at it? If doesn’t think he can fix it we may have to take it to Paul or swipe the seat off of the “parts bike.”\r\n\r\n    Gio’s cinnamon rolls are indeed yummy. They need raisins though. ;) mmm… Thanks for the info on the green tea gum Steffi.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 7:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Gio, for fixing my car lights, you rocked my little insecure world!\r\n    Take care, Priscilla, I hope you aren’t in too much pain after they take your wisdom away. Let us know if you need something.\r\n    Morgan, the green tea gum came from MP, over by the healthy treats, next to the mixers.\r\n    Have a good couple of days, everybody. Good weekend, you all worked hard. Thank you.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    *Whistling*\r\n    Went REALLY smoothly today. SO MUCH LUGGAGE. I will be done in the kitchen for the baking.\r\n    I went down and purchased disinfectant for thehelmets. Its the Lysol in the back above where we store th e luggage. MMMmmmm smells fresh! Nothing else I think. Once again, My friday has crept up on me. Every one have a good monday and tuesday! Ciao\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everybody!\r\n\r\n    Wow. the bikes were popular this morning, there must have been a fleet of them out on the streets (haha, bad joke)\r\n\r\n    I’m going to be out of the office for a few days but i set you all up with folded key envelopes (and extras already folded behind) and also napkin/silverwear sets :)\r\n\r\n    The Lawyer group returned the kitchen key which was borrowed so they could move their stuff in when Relay for Life was in the conference center.\r\n\r\n    Gio let me try one of her yuuuummy gooooey cinnamon rolls this morning. MMMMMMM!!! I have to say it was very delicious!!\r\n\r\n    OH yeah. And remember when closing and lock up EVERYTHING, everything.\r\n\r\n    I’ll be gone for a few days but feel free to facebook meeee!! i will be home in bed with chipmonk cheeks, hehe. See you next weekend.\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 12:24 am\r\n\r\n    RANDOM STUFF FOR SUNDAY 7/20\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    Guest would like to see if they could get another luggage rack please. Also their phone does not appear to be working. It may just need to be plugged in correctly. It was late and she didn’t want me to come in and look at it. Can you please have Regino look at it in the morning? He may have to take them a new phone. They are on the top most shelf behind the door in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    215\r\n    These folks are our accidental 2009 reso. They will be moving to 323 on Sunday. I have put that in the housekeeping notes but can you please ask them to take care of that room as soon as possible and to let you know when it’s done? These folks aren’t too happy about their situation so we should try to make their stay as pleasant as we can.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Bike #6\r\n    #6’s front wheel is a little bent. I don’t think it’s bad enough that the bike shop can’t true it. I don’t know if we can take it to them on a Sunday but either way I put #6 inside the fence instead of keeping it out with all the others. Marina said she rode it one night and noticed the wobble.\r\n\r\n    Well thankfully I think that’s about it. Good luck with the check-outs. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    P.S. Steffi’s Fresh Breath Emporium is out of green tea gum. That was good stuff. Where did you get that? Gourmet Galley? Mark ‘n’ Pak(otherwise known as FH Market Place)? Or though your super-special co-op connections? I want to get some. …nummers…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE ROOM\r\n    Hey all. Sorry to do this but the folks using the conference room have requested that NO ONE go in there while they are using it. If Gio has to use the kitchen they want to be informed first. They also do not want housekeeping to come in. They found one of the doors locked but ajar this afternoon and were very concerned. So. Because they have sensitive materials in there can we try to respect their wishes until they check out? They will let us know if they need anything. Thanks and sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 8:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    We are hosting a jazz night (you can read about it on the events calender) and I made some flyers for it. They are in the basket that we put the online reservations in.\r\n    GIO-\r\n    Could you put one in the cafe?\r\n\r\n    Sweet!\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is all for now.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Sooo….we are all booked for tonight! All the B&B’s are booked, the Friday Harbor House is full but the Best Western has a few rooms available.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    SNAFU CENTRAL\r\n    Like Steffi said we found a few rooms that were mistakenly made for 2009 when they should have been for 2008. Most of them were moved without incident but 2 of them are now special cases. The one we need to worry about is a room for Saturday. Rezo #1160590 will be here for 2 days. I have left a message on their phone with instructions to call us. They have 3 options for rooms. 1) They can have our emergency hold room (215) for two nights. 2) They can have 215 then move to a Sky Place for the last night. 3) They can cancel with no penalty and we can help them find a room elsewhere. No matter what they choose please try to be as helpful and as kind as possible. You can discount their room as you need. Use your best judgment, we want them to be happy. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    POOL DOOR\r\n    The pool door has stopped working. It is not making any flashing lights so I think the batteries might be dead. I will try to find the time and the tools to fix it tonight but I have also left a message on Seth’s phone. If I don’t see Seth I will try to wake up early and fix it if I don’t get it done tonight. I’ll update the blog if I take care of it.\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    The guests in 335 might want to move. They are not happy with the noise above. I think we can swap them into 338 for the rest of their stay. I am sure you will hear something from them in the morning. (Although I hope you won’t.)\r\n\r\n    Busy busy night either way. I am sorry for so many alarms and I hope the morning goes as easily as possible for you. Peace out!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 7:23 pm\r\n\r\n    The Winters\r\n    A super sweet pregnant couple made reservations with us by accident for 2009. We were able to put them up at the BW, all is good. I encouraged them to please use our facilities, so if they want to use the pool or our bikes, please let them as per moi.\r\n\r\n    2009\r\n    So after that M & I had the great idea to look for other reservations made for 2009 and we found a handful, some had add-ons, so these people are coming this year. We moved them and made notes. Guys, always call guests if they made reservations for 2009. It’s an easy mistake to make and we can avoid a lot of frustration that way.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 6:22 pm\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    We have some issues with not having enough or the wrong info regarding add-ons, like sending guests to Roche Harbor instead of our port here for a kayak trip, sending guests to places at the wrong time, with the wrong company and what not. Of course that is totally unacceptable and not how we want to treat our guests.\r\n    Please write in the guest remarks:\r\n    1) when, where, who, what, how many: 7/18, 6 PM, 3 hour kayak tour with San Juan Outfitters out of Roche Harbor, 2 adults\r\n    2) fee added, confirmed, voucher made (if not, make an alarm, explaining what needs to be done, exactly: voucher needed, confirmation needed, don’t write: follow up, that’s not enough)\r\n    3) Today’s date and your initials (I want to know who you are, always)\r\n    Too much information is better than too little. Write away. And even if it’s busy and stressful and all that, remember: we do this to make our guest’s stay more pleasant. This is their vacation, make it fabulous. Be focused and kind.\r\n\r\n    I replenished the fresh mouth emporium, check out green tea or lemon tea gum, put that mint in your mouth!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    332 is good. Regino was working on it this morning. Everything went well. We are super busy :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Can someone go to Browne’s today or tomorrow and pickup 45 sink strainers from John in the plumbing department. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA SIGN\r\n    Gary from the city came by and asked us to move our sign onto our property, it is not allowed on the side walk. Please remember when you put it out in the morning.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    can anyone work my monday evening shift at bird rock on the 21st? i was hoping to participate in a heavy rescue drill at the fire department. it only happens once a month and is required credit for my emt certification. it is a 3-11 shift monday the 21st. please help me out???\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 9:35 am\r\n\r\n    Phone Forwarding\r\n    Come and see Cindy for a little lesson, it works just fine, I tried it 3 times this am, I will run through with each of you. :)\r\n    NIGHT TIME\r\n    For now the rooms that call the front office after hours are not being forwarded to Frontline, they come into the office and receive the front desk message. It now has a recording on it that says if they reach the front offices after 11pm and before 8am, to please call the night manager. 317-7567..\r\n    Uniform\r\n    Don’t forget your brown pants and blue shirts, if you are cold wear a white long sleeve underneath your blue shirt. You all look so spiffy when you are dressing the same:)\r\n    SETH\r\n    Seth is leaving Friday at 9:30am, he will be off island today but back later tonight. So if you have any issues please call Regino.\r\n    Welcome back Priscilla, how was orientation?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 9:14 pm\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Bathtub doesn’t drain. Please have Seth look at it after noon (12)tomorrow (it’s a long stay).\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING\r\n    I just tested the forwarding to explain it to Lilly and it doesn’t let me punch in the forwarding number (busy signal, console says “wrong number”), aaarrgh.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 8:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodmorning Khai :) So I have set about 5 alarms for tomorrow morning….I’m sorry, people just aren’t picking up their phones tonight!! But you can just leave them alone and I will take care of them when I come in at 9, I just didn’t want you to be completely overwhelmed! See you at 9 missy :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 5:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING\r\n    As of tonight we will forward the 4000 to the call center at night. How? See instructions on back desk. Thank you Cindy for your never ending energy to get this finally figured out. yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN RING TRAVEL\r\n    Beware when processing ART faxes: if it says ‘Reservation Request’ on top of the page, make a new reservation. If it says ‘Rooming List’, the reservation has been made already and we simply need to double check dates, length of stay etc., before faxing it back.\r\n\r\n    DOUBLE CHECKING\r\n    Don’t forget to double check online reservations, clipper faxes, etc. in the basket on the back desk, daily, always, it needs to be part of your daily routine. Please read Cindy’s memo on the subject and initial.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan-\r\n    1028844 call these people. They need to talk to you. You know the deal.\r\n    Zeus and Thor say: Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 8:25 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Mr. Esspike\r\n    We really like your summer tips. One more thing to add, if you want to go to a REALLY fun doggy camp, try Down Town Dog, 360.378.0981 (you can use your mom’s new cell phone) you get to load up on the Bow Wow Bus and they take you to all kinds of really fun swimming holes when it is hot,(even when it’s not) they also take you on long walks in the woods or to the beach. We get to go once or twice a week, but if my parents forget to take us, or they decide we can skip a few times I (Thor) get really obnoxious with my tennis ball and won’t leave my parents alone so finally they get it that I need some extra hard play time with the rest of the dog gang at Down Town Dog.\r\n    Lavender, that sounds like a fun thing, can you eat it? I like to taste everything, sometimes my family thinks I am part goat..\r\n    I (Zeus) really like baby carrots, they taste so good when they come right out of the cold refrigerator, they are good for my eyes too.\r\n    Stay cool our fellow black lab. Maybe we will catch you at the local swimming hole soon. Anyone seen Roxi???\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodmorning Khaili! Hope I closed everything up right…it was pretty slow this evening, no major issues that I can think of. See you all at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 8:51 pm\r\n\r\n    341\r\n    Door didn’t open, blinked green, but didn’t open. Amazing Seth came by, interrupting his dinner, opened the door but couldn’t fix it. Moved guests (read file). Please please please make double extra sure that 341 gets cleaned after Seth fixes the lock. Room is blocked out until Sat.\r\n    Mr. Esspike Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 4:07 pm\r\n\r\n    BE COOL – SUMMER TIPS FOR THE BIG BLACK DOG\r\n    As we all know we can only loose heat through our tongue or feeties. Have your people put a water bone (ice cube) on your feeties. It cools you right off. If you like, twitch and growl a little, they’ll give you a treat in addition to keeping you cool.\r\n    I get aspirin after walks, because my hips are bad and I’m old. My Steffi puts it in a bread ball or a cheese ball. Leave the bread ball in your mouth for a bit, then spit out the aspirin, you’ll get way more treats that way.\r\n    As you undoubtedly noticed, the flea season has arrived. It’s not as bad as last year. If you are like me and don’t like pesticides, have your people comb you daily, then spray lavender toner on you (Laura gave some to my Steffi from the Palindaba store). It’s good against hot spots too and makes you smell like old lady. Remember not to visit with Morgan after using lavender toner, he gets sneezy. Eat lot’s of garlic and brewer’s yeast. My treats come in that taste and the bugs don’t like the smell. If your people aren’t forthcoming with the treats, just sit in front of the treat bag for an hour, they always break.\r\n    Well, my fellow black dogs, these are my summer tips. Remember, always lick your people first and then your privates, humans like it better that way.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    UNDERSTAFFED\r\n    Sweeties, over the next couple of weeks we are skeleton staffed. Please be on time, work hard, think ahead and make it easy on the person working after you. Especially at Bird Rock, do as much as you possibly can for the following shift. I won’t be around much, working the desk at ELEMENTS, but call me if there are issues. I can always do a store run, etc.\r\n    A couple of other random things: if you promise something to a guest (like an early check in), write a note in that guest’s file. Please don’t give out room numbers before check-in time, things can change.\r\n    This is it, this is what we are working towards all year. Be focused, keep your spirits high and be kind.\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    There is a lil’ package, on the desk. Came from guest # 1194995. It is a pillow from her grandmother. Its very special to her. So I have the whole shipment label ect… just need to be taken up to the San Juan post.\r\n    guest # 1224301, we were told to charge the card that is on file. The card that is on file does not want to go through. Read the notes in remark’s and see if you have problems like I did. We need to figure out another card that we can charge to pay for this room. Lets see…..I’ll probably write more after my shift :>\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG\r\n    Where are all my bloggers? This blog is lonely.. Don’t forget to blog at least once EVERY shift.\r\n    Massage\r\n    I had a massage for my neck on Monday and Richard Wills gave an awesome massage, for anyone that likes a deep tissue massage it was amazing.\r\n    Steam shower\r\n    spa d bune has a steam shower, if you have guests that are interested, it is $20 for one session..\r\n    Keep up the great work everyone..\r\n    :)\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW-UP\r\n\r\n    I processed three webervations tonight that need phone calls about whale watching/kayaking/and massages.\r\n\r\n    #1221953\r\n\r\n    #1222039\r\n\r\n    #1222118\r\n\r\n    EVERYONE:\r\n    Please read about #1057474- it is very important that if she calls everyone knows what is going on, she is already a little upset about the mixed up charges on their cards.\r\n\r\n    By the way-\r\n    Thank you everyone for the happy birthdays! it was so fun and the cake was extremely tastey!! :)\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow afternoon ♥\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 4:15 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRISCILLA AND TORY :) :):):) I AM SORRY I AM NOT THERE TO GIVE YOU BOTH BIG HUGS THIS AFTERNOON.. MY NECK DECIDED IT NEEDED AN IMMEDIATE BREAK, SO I AM AT HOME WITH THE HEATING PAD.. HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY EVER, YOU BOTH DESERVE IT..\r\n    Laura and Adam are out of the office. I think they may be back at the end of the week. Please pass anyone to me if they need immediate attention.\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Did you eat today????\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I am going to get a phone like yours, remember when you copied my Razor??\r\n    Khaili\r\n    See you at home\r\n    Have a great afternoon everyone:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    UPDATES\r\n    1) We have an update on the refund we are trying to do for reso #1028844. It turns out that since the transaction was done over 120 days ago, our system won’t allow us to refund it. We have sent in paperwork to Authorize.net that, once approved, will allow us to refund the amount. I have left a message on the guest’s phone informing them of this but if they call please just pass on the message that we should know in the next day or so if we can refund the card or, if we will have to mail them a check to refund them.\r\n\r\n    2) I have also talked to the originating travel agent for the folks up here for the trial. She is going to try and cancel the room through her system so we won’t get charged the commission for a 13 day stay. If she cannot cancel through her system she will call Unirez to inform them not to charge us for that reservation. She should be calling us later today to let me know how it went. Hopefully everything will go smoothly.\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have questions. Thanks!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    A very expensive white bathing suit was thought to be left here last night. The reservation number is 1212337 if it comes up.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 2:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!!\r\n    We all got through the weekend! Totally sold out! Everything went really smoothly I must add ;) Just a few things….\r\n    Guest# 1028844 has not been refunded yet! A few of the bike seats are broken. Three of them have no numbers on them. Errrrr. And also Natalia will probably run out of milk again before I leave. I am going to be off this mon and tue. So could you guys check up on her, and make sure that some could get her milk. Morgan ran and got her some milk today, but shes been busy out there! Let ALL the guests know that WE have the best coffee in town! Well everyone have a great couple of days! I’m outta here.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 2:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Sunny days :)\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Tomorrow morning (7.14.. Priscilla’s birthday!) someone needs to bring a small package up to Post San Juan. It is important that it is brought up because it is insulin and the man who left it needs it soon. The package is in the refrigerator so when the second morning person gets here, if one of you (Morgan or Stephan) could bring it up there, that would be awesome!\r\n    I made this a lot more difficult that it needed to be.. whoops.\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    TRIAL PEOPLE\r\n    I reserved the conference center for our trial having guests through next week (except for Tuesday, 7/15, when we have relay for life). I didn’t charge them yet, since the third room issue is not resolved. I said we would take $50 per night. Please charge once the third room issue is resolved.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hookay. Lots of randomness for you tomorrow. Here’s the biggie.\r\n    1) First the back-story. #209148163 technically has three rooms. #209597162 and #209150841 are the other two. They are here for 13 days each and all three reservations were made by a travel agent and sent in via Unirez. They are up here for court and “were” going to use #209597162 and #209150841 to sleep in and use #209148163 as an office for the duration of the stay. A bit over an hour or so after checking-in and paying for the rooms, they called and said that they no longer wanted to keep #209148163. There is a slight problem with letting them go on it. First off, it’s a huge 13 day stay and they are canceling it the day of. The other problem is that since the reservation came in via Unirez, we are going to be charged commission for this room from the originating travel agent. I told the guest in charge, now staying in #209597162 that I would have to charge them for last night pending getting in contact with the travel agent to have them rescind the commission fee for that room. Right now the full amount of the 13 day stay is charged as a cancellation fee on room #209148163. Perhaps if Steffi is in tomorrow she can decide how we want to handle refunding the guest or not. I have left a message on the travel agent’s phone but they will not be open until Monday. I have talked to the male guest in #209597162 and they know the whole deal. Ask me if you have questions.\r\n\r\n    2) There is a day spa voucher on the back desk that needs to make its way to the spa office in the morning. It was for one of our guests who walked in to make a spa treatment res. and then asked to have it paid through their room. The voucher is just for the spa’s book-keeping records.\r\n\r\n    3) Tory made a reservation for a guest (#1219217) who is moving from the Friday Harbor House to here tomorrow. They will be calling to get a ride from the FHH to ELEMENTS at around 9:30am. Raquel says that Regino will be around to run the van. Apparently the guests have a lot of luggage. They know that they will not be able to get into their room early but they do want to drop off their luggage.\r\n\r\n    4) The guest in #1192120 had us help surprise his wife with some last minute roses. He paid with his credit card but we forgot to get the receipt from San Juan Florist. Can you call them in the morning to get the total for their flowers? Thanks.\r\n\r\n    5) I am still having problems trying to refund the initial payment in room #1028844. We need to refund that $136.25 to the first card on the list. WRP gives me an error when I try to refund it and Authorize.net has the wrong password apparently. If the guest come in asking about it, please just let her know we are still working on it and we may have to have Cindy do it on Monday. :(\r\n\r\n    I think that about covers it. *wheww* Let me know if you have questions. I’ll probably be joining the world of the living around 8-9ish. :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 6:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again-\r\n\r\n    I probably could save this until I have something else to say tonight, but here I go.. again…\r\n    GIO\r\n    I filled out the voucher that you asked me to, but I wasn’t sure how long of a trip that was. I left the envelope on the back desk, so if you could fill that out, that would me awesome.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m back :D\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    Tomorrow (The 13th) the people who were in the hideaway are moving up here to the Wind. They are going to need some help with luggage in the morning at 9:30 so if you could give Regino a call and have him head down there in the van, that would be awesome. They will pay for the Wind place when when they get here to drop off their luggage.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    Wow! it sure is picking up..we are SOLD OUT.\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP\r\n    the room service invoice was returned and charged.\r\n    Linden’s reservations and vouchers are all confirmed.\r\n\r\n    ONE THING\r\n    #1207807- This reservation is staying here with us at the moment. They needed to cancel a spot on a WW trip, but we didn’t have the card on file. I called their room and left a message for the BROOKS card to come to the office and be refunded.\r\n\r\n    Also, Do we have comment cards? I think they would be a great thing to have handy.\r\n\r\n    By the way i attended the Seattle Brass Quintet’s performance and it was amazing!!!! They were all students at UW.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 2:04 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S.\r\n    The luggage from reservation #1022561 is in the back. Has her name on them. She will not have the tags\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 1:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello :)\r\n    Beautiful day! The weather is incredible.\r\n\r\n    Just a quick little note:\r\n    There is a set of keys on the back desk. They are for reservation number 1154981. They should be stopping by to grab them.\r\n\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 12:40 am\r\n\r\n    Yay blogging from home. 314, 336, 338, 341 finally did show up. They had me split the room 7 ways. That was fun. There is an amount of $136.25 that needs to be refunded to the card on file on rooms “336, 338, & 341.” I kept getting an error so maybe Steffi can you take a look tomorrow? Thanks. Please let me know if you have any questions. hokay… bed time.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST #1188048\r\n    Guest has a Sea/Sky package. Please read the notes in his file and give him the vouchers on the back desk. Please make sure to tell him that he needs to bring a lunch and some water for the trip. The Crystal Seas shuttle departs the waterfront at 10:30am. Call him if you don’t see them by 9:00am. Also apologize for me that I didn’t have the vouchers for him when he checked it. I hope he doesn’t think I was rude. :(\r\n\r\n    GUEST #1202343\r\n    Guest had ordered room service with explicit instructions to have the food in the room by 10pm. The guests where not in the room so Khaili just left it there with the Hot Bag and the clipboard w/ the receipt. Khaili was kind enough to stick around and take care of this because I had a lot of check-ins still left from the 9:30pm boat. Sadly I did not get the amount total. I did tell the guests, who came by later, that we will need to have both the signed receipt and the hot bag back in the morning. Please make sure we get those.\r\n\r\n    FRONTLINE\r\n    The call center and I talked a lot this evening. She was doing test calls and nothing of ours was making it to the call center. Bird rock was doing fine but she couldn’t get anything to work. Almost all phone calls were being rolled into the “5800″ line. I had several complaints that people trying to leave messages were being disconnected once typing “3001.” Many of the messages I did get were just hang-ups. I was swamped and I admittedly missed a few calls but I did notice that they were ringing for a long time before disappearing. Who knows just how many of the calls I missed made it to voicemail…\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Rooms 314, 336, 338, & 341 were all now shows at closing. They are all under the same name and Khaili said that she spoke with them earlier in the day. So I wonder what happened.\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-INS\r\n    Guest #1180164 was an after hours check-in. Please make sure we get a copy of her invoice in the morning.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA-\r\n    There is a pink sticky note for you on the back desk. Your name is on it, and it is for you to call this lady back. She said that she is the person taking you down to Seattle U’s orientation…?\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Room 340, #1022561. She will be leaving all of her luggage in her room, because she is leaving really early and then not coming back until after 3pm…so will one of the morning persons please go and grab all of her luggage from her room and put it in our luggage room? Thank you soooo much!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 11:08 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Bikes number #1 and #9 both need air in their front tires.\r\n    The license-less one parked near those two has loose handlebars.\r\n\r\n    LAUNDRY ROOM MADNESS\r\n    The breaker keeps shutting off in the laundry room. At first i thought that the ice machine was broken, but after i talked to Dave he told me it was a breaker problem. So i learned how to fix the breaker, but it happened again. and again. Pretty soon by the end of the night the breaker blew 4 times in a row while i was trying to get ice. Also, every time i turned the breaker back on, the washer and dryer that were interrupted turned back on again. They were stuck mid cycle.\r\n\r\n    PHONE MESSAGE\r\n    Sorry to leave this behind, but there was one phone message that needs to be returned. They need to switch the dates of their stay- the name and number are on the back desk on the message log.\r\n\r\n    NIGHTLINE\r\n    I am following the directions as written but can’t get through to the dial tone. Can someone help me?? Morgan told me to remember to press (9) first, and i do that, but it still lacks a dial tone. Instead i hear that phone voice that tells you to dial again. If i don’t press (9) then nothing happens at all…\r\n\r\n    EXTRA\r\n    The white paper cups we use in the lobby. I tried to restock them, but i do not know where their new hiding spot is.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT part 2098:\r\n    When closing out a room to be cleaned the following day, please do the following: mark the room as “closed” in the Unite Closeout section of WRP. Then write in the HK report that the room needs cleaning. Then, once the room is cleaned, erase the note out of the HK report, since it will stay there and will not clear on the following day. What? Ask me if that doesn’t make sense. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 4:05 pm\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    The pool patio keys live above the front desk door (the one with the swinging doors). Please return them to their home every time to use them.\r\n\r\n    304\r\n    The guest who will check into room 304 have some food and a bottle of wine in our employee fridge. Please give it to them when they check in.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Our gift certificates (vouchers) are in my computer under front desk resources – maps and logos – spa voucher.\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    Please empty the garbage and the coffee, do the dishes, deal with the emails in the in-box, process new online reservations every night before you leave. I know there are some things which are hard to do at night, like booking massages, but please make it nice for the person working after you (there is no “I” in team ELEMENTS!)\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 7:58 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning to all!\r\n    KEYS KEYS….misplaced keys. I opened with Lilly this morning and the patio was locked. This is fine in all, but when the patio key is misplaced, it makes it VERY hard to open Cafe Zia. So if it could be nicely put in the cafe zia keys or the pool keys, or somewhere the early morning girls can find it. That would be awesome!! Thanks\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    Ok, I don’t know if I am just off this night or if the gift certificates have been put somewhere only the boss ladies can find them but, when I went to open them so I could print some I couldn’t find them anywhere. Sorry… I didn’t get them printed out tonight.\r\n\r\n    Geez! the office is soooo stuffy.\r\n\r\n    Laura, did you find your camera? I’ll bring the VHS-DVD combo unit for you tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    IT’S ALL ABOUT THE DATES\r\n    Please always always always read the dates of a reservation back to the guest after making a reservation. And, and I can’t stress this enough, double check the dates when checking a guest in as well. Then, when making the room key, double check the room WRP assigned with the room key you just made. I know it gets hectic during check-ins, but this needs to be done, every time.\r\n\r\n    FILING SCHOOL\r\n    After you double checked clipper assignments or online reservations, please file the hard copy in the file cabinet under the fax machine. And: put the online reservation in the online reservations folder, the clipper into the clipper folder, the HK report in the housekeeping report folder. Then: the newest piece of paper always goes in the front of the folder. Got that? There will be a test next Wednesday!\r\n\r\n    Alles Liebe zum Geburtstag, Raquel, we love you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 1:38 pm\r\n\r\n    BAG TAGS\r\n    Pleas have all guest last names on the bag tags when you store them in the baggage room. This makes it MUCH easier, when you go hunting for the bag when requested by the guests.\r\n    WEBREZPRO\r\n    If there are any weird issues with WEBREZ could you please print out the invoice, put a note on it, then set it in my box. :)\r\n    GARBAGE\r\n    Everyone, regardless of what job you have, front desk or housekeeping, PLEASE pick up all garbage, small paper, cigarette butts etc…\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 9:12 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RAQUEL….. Have a wonderful birthday Ms. Raquel… :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW BIKE PROCEDURES\r\n    Per Cindy, from now on we will be locking up the bikes at night and when they are on the racks. This is to help us keep track of the bikes during the day and combat a recent rash of “late-night” bike borrowings by guests unknown. I have made up two 15′ lengths of cable. We also have 2 new padlocks that are keyed to the same key (Yay! one less key!). The front desk has a key right inside the saloon doors in the office, Cafe Zia gets one to keep in their cash bag/register and we have 2 extras in the safe.\r\n    At night, link the cables together and lock up all the bikes together. During the day, one cable will go on one rack and one cable will go on another. When a guest checks the bike out we will go with them to unlock the bike, help them size the seat, and write down the number of bike used. When the bike is returned we need to go out and re-lock the bike to the rack. Since there are so many of us on shift at any given time we hopefully should be able to pull this off. :)\r\n    The procedure will last like this until the summer dies down or we get individual locks for each bike again. I am sorry for the confusion this is going to cause Natalia Wednesday morning. I will leave Cafe Zia’s key and some instructions in their cash bag. Hopefully it’ll go alright for her. If you have questions please ask me or Cindy. Thanks!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Fax Machine\r\n    The fax toner is out, there was a thought that we had an extra toner in the back office, we don’t, so the fax machine is out of commission until the order comes in on Wednesday from SJ Office Center. The fax machine will store the faxes and when we put the new toner in,they will all print out. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, keep looking on outlook, you can then print anything you need to my back printer.\r\n    NEW FLASH**** Morgan just found the old, old toner cartridge, he will put it back in and we may get some faxes out of it…\r\n    COFFEE CUPS\r\n    Please do not order anymore coffee cups for the lobby, Raquel says we have LOTS in storage.\r\n    FRONT DOOR\r\n    WOW our front door looks awesome.. Nice and black with out any scratches..\r\n    COUNT DOWN\r\n    Priscilla turns 18 6 days.. Where has the time gone.. HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY PRISCILLA.. :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    The phones were ringing like crazy this morning!\r\n\r\n    Steffi, Morgan, etc.- I made the Colorado HeartCycle room list, it is on the back counter.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, there’s not much going on. See you all on Thursday! I’ll be at Cafe Zia…! :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2008 at 10:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    My first room service since switching to Backdoor Kitchen.\r\n    Also had to set a remote, yay!\r\n\r\n    Lots of guests in the office tonight with questions about the islands. Fun. Fun.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2008 at 3:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    Those missing remotes..They were put back in the maintenance room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE HEAVEN\r\n    Gio will store pastries she can sell the next morning in my office. These are not up for grabs. Step away from the pastries and put your hand where I can see them!\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    Chris hobbled by today and fixed the guest computer. Yeah, Chris, we all hope your back gets better soon.\r\n\r\n    GUEST LAUNDRY\r\n    The newer guest washer is broken. The plug melted a little and sparked. Khaili put an out-of-order sign on it. It seems to me another job for Super Dave?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Found the remotes in the maintenance shed. Yes, please everybody, leave them in my office.\r\n\r\n    HEAVEN\r\n    Gio baked fresh scones, croissants and cinnamon rolls for cafe zia today. Amazing. Gio and I were fantasizing about moving cafe zia into the lobby in the winter. Adam, that could be our first step for our bar? What do you think?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    Hi everyone! We are missing a clear, plastic tub full of extra TV remote controls. This tub used to sit next to the safe in the back office. Now it’s a bummer those remotes are missing but the worse part is that our ONLY copies of the 4-5 different instruction booklets for the varying remotes on the property were in that tub too. I have looked just about everywhere but nada. Raquel doesn’t know anything about it either. If anyone sees the Macedonian girls could you post the question to them too? We need this stuff back in to office pronto. If they got thrown away… Keep your eyes open! Thanks!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 9:53 am\r\n\r\n    Everyone: Please do not call Raquel before 2pm today and ask for any kind of housekeeping update, or ask if specific rooms are ready. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 8:46 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Khaili! I’ve been thinking a lot about the car wash idea. I’m a little concerned that there just isn’t enough room in the parking lot to do this. The parking lot has been seeming so crazy lately, I’m worried that this won’t work very well. Yesterday, I couldn’t even turn in to the front lot it was so crowded. I feel really bad because I would LOVE to extend this to you, but this just isn’t the time, I’m afraid. I’m so sorry.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2008 at 10:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Blogging from home :]\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    When I went out to the coffee shop, the fridge was too cold. All the milk, etc. was slushy. I BARELY turned the temperature down, and asked Steffi to check on it in a while. If all of the milk spoils, I take full responsibility.\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    Okay, so I first asked for the 10th of July to do the car wash, but a bunch of my relay team won’t be able to make it, so do you think that Friday the 11th would be okay?\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, thats all for tonight.\r\n    See you tomorrow at 1\r\n\r\n    Khai\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2008 at 5:52 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    I updated the bike check-out form (so it makes more sense). Very important: please account for all bikes at night when you put them away.\r\n\r\n    FAN IN 314 BATHROOM\r\n    Super Dave will be able to fix the light, he disconnected the heat and fan for now. We will have to have this fixed when the season is over.\r\n\r\n    WEEKEND\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work, especially Morgan, Lilly & Tory, who spent their 4th of July evening here staffing our desks. This was a big one and you all rocked.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th of July to everybody! :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 10:09 am\r\n\r\n    Me again.. sorry.\r\n    LAURA\r\n    The car wash is for JULY 10th. Not June. Whoops…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 10:08 am\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Both of the no shows for last night were under the same name. I called him this morning and he knew nothing about the reservations. They were booked for three nights (last night, tonight, and tomorrow night) for two rooms. He said that he came last year at this time, and it looks like the reservation last year, July 5th. He wanted to speak to a manager, so Steffi… :) I will talk to you and go over the details with you when you get here. As for now, Stephan and I are releasing the rooms and trying to resell them!\r\n\r\n    Spring street is already crouded. I love the Fourth Of July!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 8:55 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Fourth :)\r\n    David Waldron called. He said Hideaway is ready for tonight.\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    There were a few vouchers on the back desk that are filled out, but don’t have the dates. Were these for something special?\r\n\r\n    MO\r\n    Thanks for all your help with the chairs for the parade!\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    Question for you. My relay for life team was wondering if we could do a car wash June 10th. I was wondering if we could do it on the property. Let me know what you think.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2008 at 9:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Some how the Hideaway was over booked. The guests that checked in came back saying that there was definitely a different person staying there. So, we adjusted the price for them and sent them to an Earth Room. I left a new receipt on the back desk for them in case they would like to pick it up. Why did this happen? There is another reservation coming in tomorrow?? Do we need to find them a room elsewhere?\r\n\r\n    I called David Waldron and the # for Housekeeping and left a message with both numbers asking that they please call us back asap.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2008 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    FUZZY THINGS: Don’t forget that when you take a reservation for a pet room, you have to manually enter the pet fee ($15/night). Also, don’t forget to get the critter’s name and enter it in the housekeeping notes so that our housekeepers can set the room up appropriately.\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 10:56 pm\r\n\r\n    UH OH…\r\n    So last night when I tried to forward the calls it would not let me. I dialed 9 then *72 and all I got was a message “we’re sorry but the service is not available on this line” so I tried just *72 and got an error constant beeping. So I tried the other lines and had the exact same problem.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 5:34 pm\r\n\r\n    FORWARDING THE PHONES\r\n    As of today we will forward our phones to Front Line call center at night. How? Read and initial memo on white board. Very important: cancel the forwarding in the morning.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    As of tomorrow we will track our checked out bikes with a spiffy form Elena or I will make (in bike release form folder). Our exchange students will bring all ELEMENTS bikes to ELEMENTS in the morning and tell the FD staff which bike they have brought back. In the evening they will take a bike home and will tell the FD staff which one they will take home. Yeah! And since we are well staffed currently, when a guest checks out a bike, please go out there with him/her and help find a good bike and write down (on Elena & Steffi’s spiffy bike check-out form)which bike the guest checks out.\r\n\r\n    NOTHING TO DO?\r\n    Check the mid-day procedure list on my bulletin board and do the things on it. Walk through the lobby and gift shop as if you were a guest, then straighten pillows, vacuum, put gift shop in order, replenish coffee station, check flowers. Or walk through the property, pick up cigarette butts, behead dead flowers, pick weeds, check the bikes for air or loose parts.\r\n    Go through upcoming reservations and make sure we didn’t drop the ball somewhere, make sure we have enough vouchers, gift certificates, beach cruiser release forms, pet registrations.\r\n    And if there is really really really nothing at all to do? Read our websites (Bird Rock has some nice new guest reviews, do you know our fall special at ELEMENTS?), read our reviews on Trip Advisor, read the chamber of commerce and the visitor’s bureau websites, in short: learn about your field.\r\n    We have a busy week ahead of us, folks. Let’s be brilliant!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN\r\n    Well it would help if I would be a date and time in the below note to you, Khai I think I am just use to you knowing what I am asking:)\r\n    The chairs of course need to be put out on the morning of the 4th of July..\r\n    Thanks again,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 4:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello :)\r\n    Thanks Priscilla, it was great to work with you a little last night. Thanks you to you and Lilly for finishing that wonderful key project I gave you.\r\n    Tomorrow (Thursday) Terri Ogle is sending one of his painters to paint the front office door. The door will be taken down, so we will be without door for the day. But the weather should be warm and we will not miss it.. Plus it will be so nice to have a door with out red shinning through.\r\n    Call Center\r\n    Every night the closing person will forward the 1st and 2nd line to the call center, please see Steffi or I for directions. Then every morning, the opening person will have to deactivate the call forward, DON’T forget to ask Steffi and I for directions.\r\n    July 4th\r\n    I hope EVERYONE has a wonderful 4th of July, we will have LOTS of guests and things will be very busy, so slow down, take a deep breath and put on your lovely smiles..\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN\r\n    Would you be so kind to put out ALL available out door chairs in the front of the hotel on the sidewalk and mark the chairs off with the yellow caution tape and put a sign that says “For ELEMENTS guests”.. Please let all of our guest know as they check in that we will have some reserved chairs and it will be on a first come first serve basis.\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Steffi is going to create a log in and out sheet for the bikes, please look for her instructions on what we are expecting you to keep track of.\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Tell me about the jets in the hot tub????\r\n    STEFFI’S got a cell phone. :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh yeah, did anyone ever mail Steve Mason books. He was the man from elderhostel. He called today saying he hadn’t receieved them, but was pretty sure we had found them???\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 10:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone!\r\n\r\n    Welcome back Cindy :)\r\n\r\n    How’s it goin? Well today Lilly and I sorted through all those extra keys we had laying around and relabeled the key box. In the process we also put all the key lock boxes together. They are in a plastic container on the back desk. Gio could you give those to Seth to put in the maintenence shed today?? Theres also a container of remotes that have been hanging out on the back desk. Where do those go?? Are they there for a reason??\r\n\r\n    Diana and Olycia have bikes #3 and #8\r\n\r\n    NOTE* the guest computer it temporarily out of service. Techie Chris is out of town and will fix it as soon as he can.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    (#1196485) called back and gave the okay on the massage.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day everyone!!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 12:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Well folks, we didn’t make our June forecast. I’m sure that we’re all pretty bummed about that. I have been very carefully analyzing why we didn’t make it and I think it has mainly to do with the poor weather. Which, despite my wishes, remains out of my control. Both Elements and Bird Rock came in under expectations even though our advanced bookings were really high. What does this mean? Unfortunately for you it means no June bonus. For us, it just means we still can’t afford to pay all those darned bill collectors. BUT, it doesn’t mean we need to give up hope. Quite the contrary. I really do think that it was the weather and not the ecomony (which depsite my children’s wishes, also remains out of my control). So, let’s just all keep those beautiful smiles flashing and dazzle our guests, future, current and past, with our wonderful hospitality. Any questions, comments, ideas or dreams, just let me know. Happy July!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Guys,\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING\r\n    Please tell Raquel or Regino that the Nordstom’s group will be putting all of their stuff in room 314. They will have a late check out around 1:00pm like last time, this way they can check out of all the other rooms on time.\r\n\r\n    ISSUE\r\n    Room 106 had a clogged up sink. I tried my best to un clog it but it needed real help. Seth came in at 9:30 pm but his card deactivated, THANKFULLY Morgan was upstairs and could come to set it. Then Seth went on to fix the sink. :) It is nice to have employees that try to help as much as they can.\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Thank you for introducing me to your very cool teacher friend, I hope you all have a wonderful visit while she is up!\r\n\r\n    See you at 3:00\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 5:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Diana and Marina have bikes 6 and 10.\r\n    I am just writing it here because I am not sure of where else we are supposed to write it. Do we have some sort of system?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    This guy wanted to talk to you. Please call him back. His rez. # is 1094836.\r\n\r\n    STEPHAN-\r\n    There was a reservation made for a man today and I think I heard you talking to him. His rez. # is 1200511 and when he came to check in, there was no reservation under his name and I checked todays check ins for any name close to his name and there was nothing. I am assuming that there was a misspelling in his name and it was made for the wrong date as well, but maybe it just didn’t get processed. I’m not sure. If you recognize it maybe you would remember if you made it for a different date. Let me know if you have any questions about this.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 12:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Go ahead, call me a party-pooper. Let’s just get that out before you read any further.\r\n\r\n    Now here’s why: last year Laura and I were MORTIFIED to find a bunch of ELEMENTS chairs spread out along Spring on the Fourth of July with signs saying “reserved for ELEMENTS staff,” and occupied by the backsides of many ELEMENTS staffers and their friends and family paying no heed to the countless paying guests squished on the sidewalk behind them.\r\n\r\n    No, no, no, no. How many millions of ways can I say NO!? Is there anyone who does not get this? Please spread the chairs out again this year, but reserve them for ELEMENTS GUESTS. Remember, the folks who bring you wonderful things like…paychecks? If you want a reserved seat for the fourth, bring your own chair and stake it out down the road. This year the ELEMENTS stoop is 100% about customer service. No exceptions, and Laura and I will be checking.\r\n\r\n    Now you can call me something even worse than a party-pooper, if you want. If anyone can’t think of at least one reason why the ELEMENTS STAFF chairs sent such a bad message to me, Laura and our guests, please see me or Laura. ‘Nuff said???\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Sunday\r\n    Dave and I just got back from cruising along the West Side (sorry guys), it was so beautiful, and nice and cool. We are so lucky to live in such a wonderful paradise.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    This morning I asked Khaili to find out where all our beach cruisers are, I know that our university students have 2 of them, and one is out of service, but when I was at the hotel bright and early this am, i counted only 12. REMEMBER we have to make sure EVERY night, that they are all accounted for. Khaili please make sure that this was completed today so that we know where they all are, I told Emilija today that if she could just make sure that when they take the bikes for the night to ALWAYS tell the front desk what number, and also they should always be the older ones. :)\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    I told the girls this morning that they should get an umbrella and stand from maintenance to put up by the bar in the coffee shop, it will give them some direct sun relief and help make the counter not so hot. Morgan can you make sure this happened. Thanks\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 4:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Good news: The wedding ring was found! The family was really nice and thrilled that they found it. I had a good time talking with them.\r\n\r\n    Lilly and I think that there should be a small recycling bin next to the trash can because those cups are recyclable. We could also put some sort of sign that asked everyone to please recycle.\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is all for now.\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 12:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Request for Adam: new Coldplay cd on the playlist…pleease!?!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 12:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Gio,\r\n    I entered all the credit cards yesterday. Let’s go over that later today, if you aren’t melted by then.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 8:28 am\r\n\r\n    Hi… hello…Heya…\r\n    Well its 8.30am, and Natalia and I are dying of heat stroke! Kidding. But, WOW, I cant believe that its this hot this early in the morning. We are switching turns to sit in the shade until the sun gets a little higher in the sky.\r\n    I’m not posting anything special, just felt that I haven’t blogged in a really long while. Oh yes…. one thing! I was supposed to enter the Credit card into the computer from Zia, but they were not in the safe. Does anyone know where they went?\r\n    Well this is my friday, see all you in a few days with a fresh start on a new week! Bye~\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    p.s. Thanks Adam.\r\n    haha\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Wooohoo! Looks like it is on!\r\n    Ready, Lilly? :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Adam! I love that you like our idea!! I’m sure Khai and I would be more than willing to get all the necessary stuff and put it together and then give it to you…how exciting!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:01 pm\r\n\r\n    I really like the idea of a “meet the staff” page at ELEMENTS. If someone will coordinate, take and/or collect and email to me staff pictures I will create such a page…. Nice thinking guys….!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 5:34 pm\r\n\r\n    For me too, please!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 5:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Only if a picture of Brad Pitt can be used for my section.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 4:51 pm\r\n\r\n    PROPOSITION:\r\n    Priscilla, Lilly and I were thinking that we should have a meet the staff section on our website. It sounds kinda fun, doesn’t it? You know, with a picture and your interests, etc.\r\n\r\n    What do you guys think?\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    ..I’m not done yet. There was one other thing..\r\n\r\n    The latch to the pool house gate is broken. But not for long! We took the latch off all together so that guest’s could get in to our wonderful Cafe Zia and hang out on the patio in the sun. Maintenance report is written and Seth will work his magic next time hes in.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back.\r\n\r\n    Well, the mornings been busy with lots of guests enjoying the summer weather. There are a few things though that I would like to check on:\r\n\r\n    Room 332- the handle to the bathtub was loose, and then fell off when i went to check it! Regino went in to check it right away. Is it fixed? Great.\r\n\r\n    Have you ever heard of Quail Croft Goat Cheese?? It’s local and very yummy. If you would like to visit this local farm, you will find it at 2553 A Cattle Point Rd. :)\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the Fresh Breath Emporium Steffi!!! Now we all can show off out pearly whites and beautiful smiles..\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    HELLO SUN!\r\n    Nice weather today. It was awesome.\r\n    There was a not-so-awesome incident today, however. The guests in 312 lost a wedding ring, and they were sure it was left in there. We searched very thoroughly but nothing came up. If it is found, their reservation number is 986882.\r\n    Priscilla and I took a field trip down to the Hideaway. I like it. If you just want a quite spot, Priscilla and I thought it was perfect, as quirky as it may be :)\r\n    Alright… I think that is all.\r\n    See you tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Check out Steffi’s FRESH MOUTH EMPORIUM for the front desk staff. Enjoy luscious organic gum and assorted organic mints and have breath fresh as a dewy Spring morning in a meadow. Not only those of us who still pray to the tobacco gods (you know Laura’s heart hurts every time you smoke!), now everybody can enjoy fresh breath when talking to our guests. And remember: you can “hear” on the phone not only when you smile but also that you have fresh breath. Eat ‘em up!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 10:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again.\r\n    Room 203\r\n    The bathtub doesn’t drain. Guest is stay-over and wants to stay next to his friends. Please make sure Regino or Seth has a look at that tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Morgan for getting the boss ladies matching post-its, I especially like the one which says: Someday, Somehow. You are a sweety.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 7:33 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    I put up the schedule for 7-7 to 7-20. Due to day-off requests we are all working all kind of shifts on all kind of days, yeah, summer! So please look closely. Cafe Zia will stay staffed with just 1 person, however, I made sure on the weekends to have either Gio or Lilly work the front desk, so either one of them can jump out there and help the coffee goddesses. You guys rock, keep up the good work!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 4:33 pm\r\n\r\n    NEED TO LAUGH?\r\n    I saw such a good movie last night, I laughed out loud. It’s called: “The Darwin Awards”. The Darwin Awards do really exist and are awarded to people who die in really really stupid ways, for taking themselves out of the gene pool. I know, a tad tasteless. In the movie our hero is a total nerd, who tries to find a profile for those guys (it’s guys, always) who die in really really stupid ways, in order to get a job with an insurance company. He finds that after all he may not be so different than them, trying to find meaning, trying to accomplish something….It’s hilarious.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    INVOICE\r\n    there is an invoice on the back desk that needs to be signed when the guest leaves, and she will also need a copy. The printer had a major paper jam when she checked in.\r\n\r\n    LAMINATING SHEETS?\r\n    Laura I saw the paper you left for me to laminate but I couldn’t find any laminating sheets. Are we out?\r\n\r\n    Had a blast working with Khaili. See ya! I am off for the next couple of days (well sorta)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    San Juan Safaris\r\n    Any child under 2 years of age must stay with an adult in the cabin at all times, there is big windows on the whale watch boat so you will be able to see, or you can trade off with another adult. Please make sure ALL guests know this prior to booking a trip.\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    REMINDER:\r\n    Okay, we had a slight mishap with the clipper faxes. We have to make sure that they are faxed back after we receive and process them. Also, make sure you double check the dates. Today, I found a couple of reservations that were booked for july 8th for the clipper. I found the fax from them at the fax read: 02 July 08.\r\n    I can see how this would get confusing, but we really need to make sure that we get these right.\r\n\r\n    Did everyone notice the severe weather alert?\r\n    “SOME SPOTS MAY FLIRT WITH RECORD HIGH\r\n    TEMPERATURES…” Thank you, accuweather :D\r\n\r\n    “\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT\r\n    1)Print out the house keeping report for the correct day (today)\r\n    2) Make sure you printed the correct day (today)\r\n    3) Double check all pages are printed and submitted to R & R (a total of 7 pages)\r\n    4) Repeat steps 1 through 3\r\n    5) Give report to R & R and together repeat steps 1 through 3\r\n    I’m trying to be funny, but really, we need to get a handle on this. Please pay attention.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Lavendera Spa is closed on the 4th of July, For those guests that would like spa services please call spa d bune at 370-5027, they are going to be open to us only. spa d bune does not need our vouchers with it, they will charge the guests there and we will facilitate in making the appointment and directing our guests where they are located. If someone inquires about spa services on day of the 4th we will have an on call number to call. I will post that next week. But for spa reservations prior to the 4th for the day of the 4th call spa d bune directly.\r\n    Thanks so much.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE:\r\n    Can you please arrange a shuttle for a party of five down to the ferry? they will come at 10:00am the rez # 1133723(no actual notes in their file, just so you know the name)\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Was ready today so I picked it up form Printonyx today. Yay me!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    about the cups there are paper cups in the back as well as the small plastic cups like we used to have for water, not sure what the situation is on the corn starch cups for water.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 6:38 pm\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP\r\n    A system is only as good as the people using it. Yup, I know, pretty deep, ain’t it?\r\n    So: check, respond to, and file emails daily. People add on services, cancel, have questions, please respond to them, it is part of your job and needs to happen in a timely manner.\r\n    Check “new bookings” section in WRP constantly. Print out online reservations and process. And here is a biggy: respond to alarms and afterwards: turn them off. Elena and I started our shift with something ridiculous like 12 alarms. Half of them had been dealt with, it turned out.\r\n    Also: don’t forget to take the garbage and recycling out. Morgan put a spiffy closing check list on the back of our closing sign. Please make sure you do all those things before leaving.\r\n    Team work, baby! Don’t ask what your coworkers can do for you, ask what you can do for your coworkers. It’s summer. We can do this. Pay attention and have fun!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    I got a call from the SPA today they wanted to let us know that they will be closed on the 4th of July. So if anybody wants to book something for the 4th tell them that the SPA will not be working. Thanks\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 9:05 am\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    214 & 215 are on hold for July 3, 4, and 5. Release only if you need to.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh, yeah. Susan Jackson returned a call for Morgan conf. # 1168023\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    There were three no shows tonight..all part of the Century Tel group. I printed out their invoices and left them on the back desk in case they show up.\r\n\r\n    I’ve got a three day weekend, see you all on Saturday morning :)\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    #214345015 Expedia Reservation…please call Expedia tomorrow immediately! We do NOT have this room available and I couldn’t get through to them earlier because I was on hold for like 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n    The box in the back w/ all the shower baskets…I called Home Depot today. They will be emailing Laura a pre-paid postage thing in the next few days.\r\n\r\n    Also…their are still a couple boxes that need to be taken out to storage. (Old receipts, housekeeping reports, etc.)\r\n\r\n    That’s about it….goodnight!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n\r\n    All guests in, including two walkins.\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n\r\n    There are receipts on the back desk from the coffee shop. I didn’t know whether they had been/needed to be entered into the computer.\r\n\r\n    see you all tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    First things first-\r\n    Mo: There was an e-mail left tonight about a spa request. The spa was closed when we got that email so if you could follow up on that, that would be awesome.\r\n    Okay, I think that is it.\r\n    Good luck on your “three day weekend” Morgan.\r\n\r\n    See you all on.. thurday. :)\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 10:48 am\r\n\r\n    Spa\r\n    When we cannot use Lavendera for appointments, please call spa d bune,370-5027 but when we use spa d bune remember that we do not do the voucher system, the guest will pay spa d bune directly. But we will set up the appointment as usual. make sure to show the guest where the spa is.\r\n    #332\r\n    Morgan already said it, Island Glass came as soon as I called today, and WOW it was 2 hours later and they had it totally fixed. That is service.\r\n    Vouchers or Direct Bills\r\n    Like Mr. Morgan said DONT process payment on any reservations paying with a voucher or a direct bill, I will do that when I receive payment. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 10:38 am\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Is open for business. Yay for Island Glass.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    Just a reminder to y’all. Do not process payment at check-in for Vic. Clip. reservations. They do not need to be processed as cash, voucher, or gift cert. Just leave them be. When you check them out on their departure date it should give you a warning box that says that the amount was added to Victoria Clippers direct bill account. If it doesn’t, that means that whomever made the reservation forgot to add it to their Corporate Account. Just add it then re-check them out. Should work then. Cindy deals with the bills for those rooms. If you process the payment then we have to go back and refund everything to make it work. THANKS!!! ^_^\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 5:52 pm\r\n\r\n    YUMMY coffee, the girls are pro’s, as far as the charges go out at the coffee shop, if someone wants to charge an item from the coffee shop on to their room, make sure that you have the guests sign a charge slip, put their room number and print their name, these slips will go in the night drop bag with the daily paper work from Cafe Zia, before you put them in the bag please add them to the rooms and then put a check and your initials to indicate it has been done.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Great job on your fast, I am proud of you.. Waiting to hear how it goes.\r\n    Laura\r\n    She will be out of the office for the first few days this week, please let people calling know, and ask if I can help them of if they would like her voicemail\r\n    Bike #20\r\n    We will keep this bike for spare parts, it will be kept in the maintenance shop\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    I had the girls put a brochure rack out on the counter with some maps, that way our groovey little coffee makers can play concerige also.\r\n    Room 332\r\n    I will update you on the eta of the window on Monday.\r\n    Happy Sunday night.. :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Did I mention how proud I am of Gio and Natalia? These girls rock!\r\n    Couple of things: when we check in guests and show them on the property map where the pool, spa, laundry room is, please point out Cafe Zia and mention that it is open from 7AM to 3PM daily.\r\n    Credit card sales: when guests want to pay with a credit card at Zia, the girls will use the manual credit card machine. One of us needs to input those sales into WRP every day after Zia closes (Gio will do this mostly). Go to house accounts to do this.\r\n    Room charge: when guests want to add a coffee drink to their room, Gio will add the charge to their room into WRP on her laptop. When Gio is not working or her computer isn’t, the front desk will get a call from cafe Zia, saying which amount to add to which room.\r\n    This is all a work in progress, so bear with us and tell us your ideas.\r\n\r\n    FUN FACT\r\n    When you eat artichokes and then have a sip of beer, the beer tastes like 7up. Why?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN:\r\n    We need a tall person to get some 8oz paper cups for the lobby and the coffee shop. Are you up for the job?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 10:43 am\r\n\r\n    If the opening person could make the drip for Gio, that would be great. They are super busy in the morning and would like it is we could help them out a little :)\r\n\r\n    Also, there was an extra brochure holder in the back office, and the coffee shop needed a place to put some island maps so we brought it out there. I didn’t think it had much use sitting there empty. Just letting everyone know in case they need it.\r\n\r\n    Its been a pretty exciting morning, lots to do.\r\n    Have a great day everyone!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 9:22 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan, sounds like a little bit of a rough night. Unusual story though.. anyways, just thought i would let you know that i called Davidson about the room change. i left a message letting him know and told him if he had any questions he could give us a call.\r\n\r\n    :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 8:50 am\r\n\r\n    Can we add Cafe Zia into the extra charges scroll bar for a room??\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing with my trusty sidekick Morgan tonight. Nice, happy guests.\r\n\r\n    A guest left a message asking for more towels and if a phone call on a phone card from the room would cost her. She didn’t leave her name or number or room. Just so you know.\r\n\r\n    Also: Morgan was trying to find who made the call from which room and somebody had turned off the CMS & winlink program on the back desk computer. Those two programs need to be on at all times. They track the long distance calls from the rooms.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    please check #1187080, these guests are here but have a reservation fully paid for July. On purpose, accident? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    Happy solstice everybody!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2008 at 3:41 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERT NO SHOWS\r\n    When making a reservation with a gift cert. PLEASE make sure you get the gift certificate number. More often than not the Gift Cert. number is already used to make a pseudo-reservation on WRP. Just use the info in WRP to make a reservation that way we have the GC number. We had a no show on the Wind House last night. Res #1180029. Our cancellation policy still applies to GC reservations. If they make a reservation, and we hold that room on their GC. Should they “no show” on us we will void their GC. That’s it.\r\n    DAY SPA\r\n    Lavendera will hopefully have some more brochures available on Monday so we can get some more then for the lobby. Any thought on having a nice full-page list in the room folders?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 10:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY LIGHTS\r\n    Well the track lights above the lobby are stuck on permanent “mood lighting.” I think the ballast, transformer, or whatever handles that thing is finally going bad. Can we have Dave look at it? It’s a little dark in here without them at full power.\r\n    BIKE(s)\r\n    Bike number 20 rear wheel is bent. We need to take it over to Island Bicycles to have it repaired. I hope they can just re-true it or else it’ll cost us a new rim. Booooo.\r\n    WEDDING GUESTS\r\n    Well as you may have notices we are almost sold out for Saturday. A lot of those folks are with a rather largish wedding. That means that there will usually be a run on irons and ironing boards. if it looks like everyone and their bridesmaid needs one here are some tips. Refer people to the full-sized ironing board and steam iron in the guest laundry room. Ask guests to call you when they are finished so we can have housekeeping pick it up and take it to another guest. Just a thought. Also a big concern with wedding guests are the folks who are trying to get into their room extra early to get ready. Because we are so full please try to avoid moving rooms around. There is too much of an opportunity for reservations to me messed up or wrong room keys given out. Good luck morning folk.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s my 2 cents.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing:\r\n    We had a mishap with the housekeeping report today. Whoever prints out the housekeeping reports for Raquel or Regino, please check the “page 1 of (insert total number of pages here)” at the bottom of the first page, and count to make sure that all of those pages are there.\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA:\r\n\r\n    It is really important that you tell Raquel or Regino that 308 needs to be cleaned as soon as the housekeeping staff gets here. Read the remarks in res. # 1418 for details.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n\r\n    See you at nine.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well folks we are almost sold out for Saturday. WOOHOO!!! I have put rooms 304 and 335 on Emergency Hold. Please do not forget to release them if everything is looking good.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 11:26 am\r\n\r\n    Ok…so I organized the back cabinet with all the brochures, so hopefully it will be a little easier to find what we are looking for. Also…we are running low on a few brochures for San Juan Safaris, M & W, Susie’s, etc. So I called all the places that we need brochures from and they will hopefully be bringing them by in the next few days.\r\n\r\n    Also! Alarms…they can be kind of confusing when it just says “follow-up” but there are no notes in the reservation…what am I following up on?\r\n\r\n    Airplane poster in the lobby….we don’t sell them anymore as most of you probably know. They can be found on linneadesigns.com\r\n\r\n    Western Prince has tons of space on their 2pm whale watch today…and J-Pod is back so whale sightings are almost a guarantee. Western Prince also wants us to know that their set summer schedule will be a 2pm everyday, with a 10am cruise on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\r\n\r\n    That’s pretty much it…the phones have been ringing like crazy this morning!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    The lady in rm 323 wants to know exactly were we got the poster that is framed in our lobby, I tried to find it be the artist name but I couldn’t find that exact print. She will be in, in the morning if someone could have that info handy.\r\n\r\n    Please Call SJO in the am and add an extra adult to for rez # 1153452? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    It was a nice quiet evening.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 7:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Cool, Khaili, thank you!\r\n\r\n    And since Gio forgot to brag, I have to: Gio, I’m so proud of you! Gio went to local businesses and gave out coupons for Zia, got us orders from all kinds of people, because we use organic milk and Gio has a reputation as the espresso queen on the island. Yeah!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone!\r\n    I feel like it is October… sun, where are you? :(\r\n    Okay, so I have a couple of things to tell you all–\r\n\r\n    The first is a reminder that the summer ferry schedule is in effect on the 22nd. YAY! Summer is almost here!\r\n\r\n    The second is that I made up a waiting list for the people who request a room that isn’t available when they make their reservations. It is an excel document and it is in the “waiting list” folder. Filling it out is pretty much self explanatory.\r\n    Things to remember about this waiting list:\r\n    -Always check the waiting list after a cancellation is made, to see if someone requested that room for that time.\r\n    -It is a first come first serve deal, so before you let the customer know about the opening, make sure they were the FIRST ones to request that type of room.\r\n\r\n    Have a great night, everyone-\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    TEST RESERVATIONS\r\n    We got several TEST reservations the last couple of days. They originate from from Reach Local, a marketing company cooperating with Blizzard. I called and asked them what up. They said to simply cancel those test reservations.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 12:52 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered a case of paper with the property map on the back from Printonyx. Should be ready for pick up in a week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 10:36 pm\r\n\r\n    BACKDOOR KITCHEN VOUCHERS\r\n    I made a voucher log and put our very first entry in it, but we do not have anymore of those pocket dividers here so for now the sheets are in the front pocket of the voucher folder. I know we have lots of extra at BR so I will bring some up with me when I come in tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    How weird to be here at ELEMENTS it feels like its been forever and like I should be doing dishes or breakfast prep or… something.\r\n\r\n    We got an online rez. (1183530) requesting that we add a whale watch tour to the guests stay because she wants to join her sister who is supposed to have already had a trip booked for the 21st with San Juan excursions at 1:00pm, but when I looked up the sisters rez (1181056) there was nothing noted about whale watching anywhere. I called San Juan excursions and left a message to check that nothing was booked and then not noted. If they call back and nothing has been booked please make sure that it does get booked. This is kind of a rambling blog so ask me if you have any questions, in any case I will be in at 3:00\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 8:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Evening ALL:)\r\n    Thanks everyone for attending the customer service staff meeting today, it is great to be able to talk with you all and express what we as managers feel are our strong points and weak points and to know that you all are able to take it and process it as needed. If you have any imput I would love to hear it.\r\n    BOXES\r\n    When you put boxes in the recycle bin please break them down, if you don’t it fills up the recycle bin really fast.\r\n    Parking Bumpers\r\n    WOW, the housekeeping staff went to town and painted all the curbs, they look fantastic, Thanks everyone..\r\n    FISH\r\n    Did you see the cute little fish in the pool tonight? I think their names were Zoe and Mia, they were doing all kinds of tricks lead by their trainer Khaili\r\n    Happy Wednesday EVE..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 10:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Just letting you all know that some of the members from the Elements Relay For Life team may be stopping by to drop off some paper work for me. If they do, could you please just put those in my box. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\n    Also, if Backdoor Kitchen e-mails us their logo, it is for the dining vouchers. There is a voucher already made in publisher, so if you get that e-mail, please copy and paste it into the voucher. If this doesn’t make sense (very possible) just ask me.\r\n\r\n    One more thing… Seth put the new bikes out today. If someone wants to use them, make sure that they know that the seats are not adjustable yet. The adjustable seat clasps aren’t here yet.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Khaili :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2008 at 10:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n\r\n    The Pacific Lutheran elderly group has been told that they have 12:00 check outs, please let Housekeeping know. They also will be bringing their bags into the office to be stored, we are then suppose to load their bags into the van and take the luggage for the 18 people down to the clipper for them. Hopefully those people will find their own way down.\r\n\r\n    I also confirmed a webervation, and caught that they were looking for a massage. Since the reservation is for 6/22 lets try and get it booked right away! it may be a side by side.. “lets make it double”\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n\r\n    There was a phone message for you, look up #210275808 and read the remarks.\r\n\r\n    Well, my nights done. See you all at the staff meeting tomorrow!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 16th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    Phones were ringing off the hook tonight.\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    -Remember the Romance package\r\n    -Room 115 is a stay over, they bought another room so they could hang out all day until their ferry home.\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Room #112 needs a new room binding\r\n\r\n    Yikes! I found something special in the back room and left him on the back desk for everyone to see.\r\n\r\n    Hope all the newbies have fun on the field trip.\r\n\r\n    See you at 3:00\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino, Thank you for digging through the trash to find the clipper ladies misplaced Clipper tickets. That was amazing!!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 12:56 pm\r\n\r\n    David Waldron from the Hideaway called today, he has some friends that will stay in the Hideaway on Saturday the 21st, I marked the room as closed for that day.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 11:38 am\r\n\r\n    Ok so we had a ton of bags this morning…and probably more to come throughout the afternoon. And that back room is SOOO full. Can we make a plan to clean that room this week? It is so messy and there is barely any room for bags…let’s try to make a bit more space for the bags so Cindy and Laura can actually get into their office…haha.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    NO SHOW\r\n    #31923 was a not show last night. She had moved her reservation to today because of our pool closure in April. I bet she just blew it off because we were letting everyone cancel with no penalty at the time. If she still hasn’t shown by morning just cancel the reservation and let her go without further charges. Thanks!\r\n    OTHER INFO\r\n    - Just warning you that you will probably have a whole mess of folk looking for bikes in the morning. I had a lot of inquiries. One guy has already filled out the paperwork and will be in to drop off his card and take a bike.\r\n    - Don’t anyone order more coffee for a bit. We have a bag in the fridge that NEEDS to be used up. Thanks!!\r\n    Seez you all later!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 8:47 pm\r\n\r\n    School is out! It seems so surreal. It hasn’t quite hit me yet.\r\n    PRISCILLA AND LILLY\r\n    Tomorrow I will be in at 2:30 instead of 1. Just a little heads up.\r\n    Not much else to say… I am usually so talkative :D\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    I’m just going through upcoming reservations and noticed not enough info on renting the conference center. We’ll need to know:\r\n    1) what time of the day the guests will need the conference center\r\n    2) what the occasion is\r\n    3) contact information for host, full address, phone number\r\n    4) is there no charge because we donated it or did one of us not put a price in?\r\n    5) make alarm for a couple of days prior if there are room set up requirements, so Raquel can have a heads up.\r\n    Morgan made sure we have a functioning conference center key in the key cabinet on back desk.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 6:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I will telecommute tomorrow (as in: stay home). Please call me at home with any issues.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    YEAH CAFE ZIA NOW OPEN\r\n    Gio, Natalia, you did great! Thank you so much for making it all happen, Gio.\r\n    Bosspeople: what kind of sign do we want? Morgan researched the city code for signs. We could hang a sign from a pole extending from our E sign (highly visible). Or we could have a sandwich board, but only on our property, not on the sidewalk (plus with all the cars parked there, nobody would see it driving by).\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 4:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Will someone make sure Gio gets the message tomorrow that Angie called her back about baked goods. The message is on the back bulletin board. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-IN\r\n    #1176229. She’ll be by in the morning for assistance with booking massages and dinner reservations. So please do the voodoo that you do.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    FD UNIFORMS\r\n    It’s on, Baby! Starting tomorrow we will all wear: chocolate brown bottoms & blue E shirts. No other colored shirts, no vests, sweaters and what nots (Cindy will provide us with plain white long sleeved shirts to put under the blue if it’s cold), no flip flops, no unbrown pants, no supershort skirts and shorts(knee length please). Ladies: strap em in, if you know what I mean. If you show your gorgeous legs, shave them.\r\n    Not following the dress code may result in drowning your puppy, telling your boyfriend that you have an affair, having your head shaved or other punishment we see fit.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 2:51 pm\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETING STAFF MEETING STAFF MEETING\r\n    Yeah! Wednesday, 6/18, 2 PM at ELEMENTS. This is a mandatory meeting. Khaili & Lilly will work our front desks. Gio, Stefan & Lina will be here already. Elena & Tory, please come an hour early to work. Priscilla & Morgan, please come. Kaitlyn is excused.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    I’ll need a way to get a hold of you. Is your cell working again, do you have a home number?\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY 6/17\r\n    Morgan will take our newest exchange students off island. Lilly will work the front desk at E and will not be training at BR that day.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 1:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everybody :)\r\n    I must let you know something. Western Prince just called. They’ll have an additional WW cruise every Sunday 4pm :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    #1077016 finally got a hold of our no-show. He said that he canceled months ago…does anyone recall?? Because we have no record of him canceling, but he does have a second reservation in July…maybe it was just a mix-up.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2008 at 11:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Lilly!\r\n    Reservation#1077016 was a no show this evening. Could you please follow up on this please. They have a massage scheduled for 8/13/08 at 345pm. Invoices and voucher is on back desk. Thanks\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you so much Steffi for finding that reservation! I called him this morning to verify the date and I have yet to hear back, so I will try again before I leave today, but hopefully we will hear from him soon.\r\n\r\n    Also, to everyone..there are a lot of bookings that have been left in the “new bookings” section and have not been confirmed yet because of credit card problems, we have gotten a hold of those who’s credit cards are not working so we will be trying to confirm those reservations asap…we are just waiting to hear back from people.\r\n\r\n    A pretty busy morning…lots of phone calls and online reservation. We had a little scramble earlier when we couldn’t get the Visitors Bureau ladies into the Orca Room because our key is expired. So we had Morgan make us a new key because none of us are a high enough level to make that key…but they ended up just having their meeting out by the pool patio and they were more than happy to just be outside.\r\n\r\n    That’s the only major things I can think of…Gio is making us some pretty delicious coffee…thanks girl!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 8:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    #1172754. I found his 2nd reservation: #1157303, it was made for July. I don’t want to upset the guest any more by calling super late. Please call him, first thing tomorrow, verify the month of his stay and cancel the respective second reservation (have Cindy show you how to apply the payment he already made to the rightful reservation). And please be super nice.\r\n    EVERYBODY: always, always, always read back the reservation details to the guest. It is so easy to get the day, month or even year wrong in WRP.\r\n    Also: when you search for a guest and spell the name just a little different, WRP will not list the reservation. It’s a bit of a flaw. What I do is: search by last name (that’s what I did in his case, nobody misspells that)or by the first couple of letters: WEH as opposed to WEHNER.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 6:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a friendly little fyi. Please be sure to suppress prices for all Victoria Clipper reservations. I had a checkin today that was not suppressed. This was already mentioned in the blog earlier I just thought I would remind everyone.\r\n\r\n    Also Ralph the flower guy called this afternoon and let us know that he will not be in this week. So does this mean we need to make different flower “arrangements” this week with someone else until then?\r\n\r\n    Thank you Cindy for the chat today. I will be sure to slow down and focus on guests that are checking in for now on! I don’t know how that could have happened. I love everybody!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    PS…one more thing. 1172754..called today could not find the reservation anywhere. He was super upset so I remade the reservation and he was going to check his debit card online, to make sure we didn’t already charge him for his first “reservation.” He said he will email us with the go-ahead to charge the 10%…hopefully we will hear from him soon.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 3:17 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m back! So there were a few things this morning that I thought were important to fill everyone in on.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, this guy Henri with the group that just came in, he said he talked to you about his lost camera. I told him we would call him with any information we got about the camera. His number is 206-420-9429, he was in room 336…everyone keep your eyes out for a camera!\r\n\r\n    Ok second, tomorrow we need a van ride to the airport at 4:30. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\n    Also, I refunded 986158…she was uncomfortable about the outdoor entrances…she said we don’t have that on our website anywhere. Should that be something we put up??\r\n\r\n    I think that’s about it…I am so happy to be back!! :D\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 9:21 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning:)\r\n    Welcome Natailya and Lilly… Lilly is working at ELEMENTS today, and then is coming to Bird Rock to train, Gio is training a day early with Natailya in the coffee shop..

I’m back and refreshed. I have a food handlers card that is good for two more years. I will get a copy from Health Dept today! Yah! All the goody treats came in! The Cafe Zia is on the….High Five! This is just a short lil’ brief for now.\r\n    Welcome Natalia! CHAO!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2008 at 7:33 am\r\n\r\n    Is this really June? Snow in the passes, downed trees and power outages?? The good news is better weather is on the way!\r\n\r\n    Hey Priscilla, remember to use guest reservation numbers not names…I edited your last post. Thanks.\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2008 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    few things tonight.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n\r\n    1169325 never called back about the kayaking tours. Also, thanks for the help with the card machine. I was very scared when i got several encoding errors in a row…but then morgan saved the day when he realized it just needed a good ole’ cleaning and showed me where the cleaning cards were. thank you!\r\n\r\n    Also, for tomorrow remember West Marine is coming in…\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n\r\n    Ken Condray called back about the bicycle group, he said he will be in touch with you soon.\r\n\r\n    other than that fairly slow, three walk ins though. YAY!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    FSA\r\n    A great load of cookies, candy, chips and frozen treats arrived from FSA today. The non-freezer foodstuffs are in the corner of the Cedar room. The frozen stuff was split between the two cafe freezers and my freezer. The only reason I had to split things up was because I kept the treats in their boxes. I didn’t know if there were specific plans for them so I didn’t want to mess with it. Don’t worry I won’t eat the ice cream cups that are in my freezer. I don’t like raspberry. bleh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Event calendar for August done!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 7:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing too exciting today. Phones were DEAD all day, until Steffi got here… :)\r\n    The sink the the Wind Place’s small bathroom appeared to be sealed shut, until Morgan went over and figured it out (when he was off duty.) Thank you, Morgan.\r\n    I only have five more days of school left(!!!) so I will get to work my first full week soon.\r\n    Hope everyone has a great week-\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 6:39 pm\r\n\r\n    NATALIYA\r\n    Missed her Kenmore air flight. I booked her a room at the Hilton. She will be on the 12.30 Kenmore air flight tomorrow (arriving FH airport at 1.05). We’ll need to reimburse her for the cab ride from the Hilton to Boing Filed (as per Laura). On my desk find a manila folder with schedule, phone list and stuff for her.\r\n    Welcome Nataliya! I’ll meet you on Thursday!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 5:14 pm\r\n\r\n    110 & 111\r\n    Fuse blew in both rooms (#2) and kept blowing, sparks flying out of the outlet on the lower right in 110, where the reading lamp is plugged in. I put guests in other rooms and blocked rooms out for 3 days (wrote MR), please have somebody (Dave?) have a looksy and let HK know to clean the rooms before releasing them.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please go to the bank and get small bills in the next couple of days. Dankeschoen!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO\r\n    Please plan on taking the food handler’s class on June 19, 9AM at the Mullis fire station, together with Lina,Stefan & Natalia. We’ll pay for it. Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    NOISE COMPLAINTS\r\n    Cindy please read the notes for reservations #1167227 & #1069106. I personally don’t think these rooms should be comp’d seeing as they made so much trouble for paying guests. But what do I know…\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    I think the timer controller for the is to blame for the bubbles not turning off. When I flipped the breaker on this morning the jets immediately turned on. I have decided to leave the jets off for the day or until Dave can take a look at the thing.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Well something is up with the hot tub’s bubbles. The darn thing won’t turn off. You can press the button as many times as you want but once they’re going, there’s no stopping them. After letting them run all day I finally just flipped the breaker switch to shut them off for the night. I talked to Dave and he knows that we may have to have him come by on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    had actually 2 last night. The guests loved the food, but Morgan & I scrambled with dishes & silverware. Raquel will get some more matching dishes & silverware. She will put them up on the shelves in the luggage room. Please don’t use those dishes (and especially the silverware) for your personal lunches. Gracias.\r\n\r\n    PET BLANKETS\r\n    Raquel will put some more pet blankets in our bathroom. If you ever run out, they are in the laundry room, right above the door (not the ones on your left, these are the people blankets)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 12:15 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S. There is a TON of great Mexican food left over from the party last night. It is in the coffee shop’s fridge. Help yourself!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 12:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Pretend that I am Cindy– :)\r\n\r\n    If one of the guests runs away with a bike, don’t make a big deal about it. Next time they are in the office, ask them nicely to please come check in with the office next time.\r\n\r\n    Morgan-\r\n    Could you please order some more of the seat adjustment things (great explanation, I know) for the beach cruisers? I’m not sure how many. Cindy will know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Cindy, I noticed that the clipper now sends us faxes with 8 room allocations daily. That is not how I understood the new arrangement you made with them. I put the faxes in your inbox. Can you clarify this for us, please?\r\n    Also: everybody, please make sure that you suppress the pricing on clipper invoices. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    We had our first room service today. BDK now has one of our yellow heating bags. They also printed the menus for Bird Rock. I put them in your box, Laura.\r\n\r\n    SJ OUTFITTERS\r\n    has a whale watch tomorrow at 1 PM out of Roche Harbor and plenty of space. Please let interested guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 4:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Graduation Priscilla, Alex, Chad & Kiersten! We are proud of you guys! Have a great life!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 10:58 am\r\n\r\n    UPDATE ON SPA:\r\n    This weekend the Spa will allow one more extra booking starting @ 6.30pm for Fri Sat Sun only. If you have any questions ask me! ;)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 11:36 pm\r\n\r\n    We had a few guests tell us that they were unable to log on to our wireless. Called Morgan and did some troubleshooting. Thank You Morgan for helping us while in Seattle on your day off. We were unsuccessful and called the infamous Chris Terren. He worked on it quite a bit but said he was going to have to send the Big Guns over tomorrow and they will have to work on it.\r\n\r\n    Also Colleen from San Juan Safaris called to confirm a reservation and gave us a little fyi that they are offering an Adults only cruise for $85 per adult @ 130 starting this Saturday for people that don’t care to whale watch with children with a maximum of 12 people ages of 14 and up. And they are also adding Sunset tours now at 530 in the evening.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Boy I’m glad I had my great co-worker Tory with me today! What a crazy day/night! I pretty sure all the guest’s are happy though! So I’ll let Tory explain all the haps….But for Cindy: I could not move any of those boxes into the cedar room, or could I lift them into the ORCA room by myself. Some of them are real heavy. I am working bright and early in the morning so I think we can get it figured out before the party. Maybe I could get some strong help? I tried calling you, and Tory said you were really busy tonight. Well I’ll see you in the morning. Good night..ZZZZzzzzzz…..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    I can’t blog in the Bird Rock blog. Every time I submit the screen goes blank and it doesn’t save my message. I tried closing every tab, same thing. Why, why why?\r\n    So, anyway, below another blog for Bird Rock:\r\n\r\n    FIRE ALARM\r\n    I called Guardian and they’ll contact the electrician from L&I, he will be here in the next couple of days. Guardian will also call the Fire Marshall and ask if he just wants to stop by or if he wants Guardian to be there with him. Please blog when L&I comes.\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINES\r\n    We have spare espresso under the lobby counter. If we get low contact Laura, since she will have to order more online and it will take a couple of days.\r\n    Steve from SJ coffee researched some decalcifying agents for smaller machines. Laura, can I show you, maybe we can order some online? I contacted the machine manufacturer to no avail.\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Paul serviced the hot tub right after we checked it. Everything is good, please check again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I-HOMES & MATRESS COVER\r\n    Gio called me to pick up I-homes which were delivered to E. I believe they belong into the Sky places and not to Bird Rock. Laura? I left them at E for now.\r\n    There was also a organic cotton matress cover, which I took and placed in the luggage room. Please let Raquel know it is here.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a good meeting today, keep up the good work.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Cynthia Elliot will be picking up legos that Theresa Romero is dropping off…I’m just a messenger. A lady that was staying in the Wind Place last night called tonight with this message. My feet hurt but my pants are cute.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2008 at 8:46 pm\r\n\r\n    BELOW FIND MY BIRD ROCK BLOG, BIRD ROCK BLOG MOMENTARILY OUT OF SERVICE?\r\n\r\n    MORNING KAITLYN\r\n    Lina will be training with you on Thursday. She hasn’t done breakfast yet or answered the phone, everything else she has at least heard once. Please include her in your routine.\r\n    Also: can you work next Sunday (6/8 morning instead of night? Elena wants to have some kind of a life (ridiculous), Tory would work the PM if you worked the AM?\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK FD STAFF MEETING\r\n    Thursday, 2 PM. Elena & Stefan, please come down for that. Tory, please come an hour early and join us. Have your questions & suggestions ready. See you then.\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINES\r\n    They need to be decalcified monthly. This will be our first time doing this and in the manual it says: ” Use a descaling agent and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.” Mhm. GIO, HELP! Is a descaling agent the white powdery stuff? I’ll call SJ coffee tomorrow and find out more.\r\n    Also: do we have more regular espresso pods, I can only find decaf?\r\n\r\n    FOOD\r\n    Elena got us produce (Thank you!) We have a couple of cases of fruit in the luggage room. Please go through every day and make sure we don’t have a rotten apple in there, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\n    PRINTER\r\n    I’ll ask Cindy to order us another ink cartridge. Did we run through the spare already, Elena?\r\n\r\n    Hey Laura, I think 400 earplugs will get us through the next couple of months. Let’s see. Thank you for getting them.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n    This is REALLY IMPORTANT: Starting immediately Victoria Clipper will be allowed to book 4 rooms above the block for the month of June, AND 4 rooms above the block Monday thru Thursday in July.\r\n\r\n    I know this seems complicated but there is an easy solution. Here’s what you do:\r\n\r\n    1. answer the phone, and if VC says, hi this is __________ from VC, I would like to book a room above the block\r\n\r\n    2. you say just one moment while I check availability\r\n\r\n    3. go to WEBREZ type in Victoria Clipper in the search box, scan down the list to see if there are rooms left above the block for that day (you will know because if you make a reservation above the block under the guests name it will say “ABOVE THE BLOCK”) if there isn’t say I am sorry I only have rooms available at our rack rate, if there are you take the reservation, using the VC pricing, you take the name of the guest, the clipper reservation #,(basically take all the info you do with a reg. VC reservation) and in the notes section you type in bold letters “ABOVE THE BLOCK”\r\n\r\n    4. REMEMBER NO above the block for weekends in July\r\n\r\n    5. Above the block will always be made over the phone, it will never come thru as a fax\r\n\r\n    6. You will see the above the block reservations on the fax, when it comes thru for us to confirm, but they will already be in the system.\r\n\r\n    ANY QUESTIONS, just ASK…\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 6:35 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA: New rules: Until further notice, no one makes coffee in the coffee shop except me and Gio. (Gio, will you make sure that the coffee shop gets locked up, in case it was someone other than an employee who decided to help themselves to the supplies…)\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 6:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! How did everyones weekend go?\r\n    I have a few things that I need to go over about the coffee shop. I have a million things back there, its disorganized and cluttered! This will be soon be fixed when I get a few days to soley be out there and do my thing. One thing though, I cannot be having people go out there a rummage through boxes, make coffee, ect and not CLEAN UP! I came out there this afternoon to find a PIG STY. Coffee had been left open, machine was filthy, and old crusted grounds left in the Portofilter that had completely dried up. I had to chizzle it out. Also coffee beans were spilled all over the grinder area, shot glasses that had been sitting with nasty residue in them. Dirty spoons……It goes on and on. I don’t mind that whoever wants to make a coffee, BUT you (coffee maker) is entitled to pick up your own mess. The coffee beans are not fresh anymore, and that really stinks! That was five pounds of coffee in there! I found this really disrespectful and rude to leave the mess for someone else to clean!\r\n    IMPORTANT!!\r\n    Every time you make shots, you have to dump the coffee out of the portafilter! This will ruin the gaskets!! And if you switch something around in there, like a different kind of coffee, let me know so I at least know where I’m at. That machine out there is really expensive, and if kept cleaned then it will last a lifetime! Please be respectful!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Please when you put out the bicycles, will you park them in their designated spot, they feel lonely and out of place when they are in the wrong parking spot:)\r\n    Flowers\r\n    NEVER EVER, have flowers in the lobby that have gross water and dead leaves, it is better to have no flowers then gross ones.\r\n    Surveys\r\n    The Surveys for our customers by the key machine are there so that everyone will give a survey to EVER check in. The SJIVB is trying to gather information and if WE don’t give them out, well let’s just say we are being lame. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE hand them out..\r\n    Thanks everyone for not parking in the wrong places,, I really appreciate it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-OUTS\r\n    Most of the marathon folks are wanting a late check-out. While we have done our best to encourage people to depart on time and/or use the pool house for changing I have a feeling that we will have some major stragglers. Please warn Raquel/Regino in the morning. Hopefully everyone will be respectful of the check-out time. We tried not to give people later than a 11:30 check-out.\r\n    SYSCO\r\n    I have put in an order for two boxes of creamers. Hopefully we will get those on Monday. We may have to put out some of the powdered coffee-mate packets until they arrive.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! Laters!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    MOUSE\r\n    on front desk computer by white board is dying. Can we please get a new one?\r\n\r\n    CHECKING GUESTS OUT\r\n    Please remember to check out guests in the morning. WRP doesn’t let you check guests in when another person still checked into a room. Very confusing during ferry rush.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    Please fill out lost & found requests (in folder on back desk where bike release forms are) and give to Raquel or put in her box. Remember: sticky notes are not your friend! Also: when Raquel finds something in a room, she will put a little Lost & Found note describing the item on the HK report of the day the item was found. That way you can tell the guest that we have the item in question and fill out a Post San Juan form right there and then.\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE\r\n    Please pay a lot of attention when giving guests their luggage. Always match the luggage tag in the luggage to the tag the guest gave you. One of us gave a guest’s luggage away today. I found it, but that is really really not o.k.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Most menus are in the room. Morgan & Khaili will finish the task tomorrow. So be prepared to get Room Service calls soon.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 3:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    This morning went well, no real complaints other than a noisy neighbor who checked out today.\r\n\r\n    There are two lost item requests that I received this morning, they are on sticky notes next to the front desk phone. Please ask Raquel if anything was found, were looking for books and a sonic care tooth brush charger.\r\n\r\n    There was also one other thing, the pump in the pool house was making weird noises so Mo called Dave. He said it needed work and tried to get in touch with Rob Sandwith to fix the problem. If it is not fixed by tomorrow the planters by building A need to be watered so that the beautiful fleurs do not die.\r\n\r\n    I got to some of the alarms, there are still a few vouchers needed. Lots of reservations made today!! yay!!\r\n\r\n    -Priscilla\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 10:31 pm\r\n\r\n    INFO\r\n    - Nice night. Everybody is in and happy. (as of 10:30pm let’s hope it stays that way) Nice folks in 112 this weekend.\r\n    - I feel sorry for the folks at B-Rock because Herbs is holding a special impromptu Karaoke night tonight. Noisy off-key drunk people Booooo!\r\n\r\n    FOURTH OF JULY\r\n    OK. The theme of the fourth of July parade has been announced and I want to enter a float. I have had a hilariously funny (IMO) and slightly in-poor-taste idea for a float since High School. I have told several people about it over the years but I have never got around to actually doing it. Well this year is the year. I am looking to enlist some good men and women to join me as members of the A.P.S. Want to know what A.P.S. means? Come talk to me. I need at least 4-6 people to make this work, more is always better. Join the proud ranks of the A.P.S. I can promise free meeting refreshments, t-shirts, and black ski masks for all new recruits. Come on. If that doesn’t pique your interest I don’t know what will.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    the keys (hideaway + pool) are in the door of the key cabinet on the back desk. The apartment is on top of Christie’s Island Salon, next to Creme Brulee. Guests may park here at E and use our amenities (pool, bikes, wireless, there is no wireless in the Hideaway). Check in like a regular check-in, then show guest location on a map.\r\n\r\n    Morgan is researching how to work in the US. Cindy or M might need to call the social security office in Mt Vernon on Monday, so we have everything we need when we go there on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n    Lina & Stefan will come early tomorrow and we’ll put the Back Door Kitchen menus in the rooms.\r\n    Both Lina & Stefan will have their birthdays while here, we so gonna have a party.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I’ll go biking with you anytime. Next time let’s go all the way to Herb’s.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome Lina and Stefan, don’t worry being confused is okay, we all went through that. Enjoy and ask lots of questions.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 4:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan (acutally all employees who drive to work)\r\n    Mr. Morgan, will you please park your van up at lot A, (I am not trying to pick on you only but I noticed your van by building D when I was leaving)or where you usually do by your back gate. Adam will be passing out parking tickets for anyone who is parking in the NO parking zones… Beware…No really, right now this time or year, we all need to leave all front parking spaces and in the front of room parking spaces empty for our guests. There is plenty of parking up by building A on the side. Thanks everyone.\r\n    NEW BIKES\r\n    I have ordered 20 new beach cruisers 5 new orange, 5 new purple and for Bird Rock 5 shiney black and 5 vanilla. When they arrive please have them delivered up by the maintenance and make sure I know they are here. Morgan would you be willing to help assemble?\r\n    I have also ordered 20 new bike helmets, please put those in the front office.\r\n    June 6\r\n    You are all invited to Alex’s graduation party on the pool patio, even if you are on shift come out and get a yummy plate of Raquel food. It is from 5-8pm.. Be ready for my family, 18 members will be arriving on Friday:) Their lots of fun..\r\n    Steffi and Cindy\r\n    We went for a bike ride today, I must say it was short and sweet and am really think that it should be mandatory that we all take a spin once or twice a day to clear our heads when we are at work.. Steffi we should have made that ride longer..\r\n    Have a great weekend.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    HI! It’s my first day! I’m confused.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 7:49 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK PHONE NUMBER\r\n    Bird Rock’s business cards have one of the ELEMENTS phone number on it (4000). When calls come through that number and guests are confused, please be helpful and understanding, ask if they maybe wanted to reach Bird Rock and help them with their reservation. In general, when guests are inquiring about our sister hotel, just pull up the other hotel’s WRP and help them out. Thank you, Tory, for always doing that. We’ll fix the business cards soon.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT/CHECKING OUT GUESTS\r\n    Please remember to check out guests (on WRP) around 3 PM. This is a morning staff duty. Please mark all rooms clean at that time as well (unless they aren’t). WRP marks rooms dirty when you check a guest into a room, so you only need to mark rooms dirty manually if an unoccupied room is dirty for some reason (moved guest to a different room, construction, etc.)\r\n\r\n    STAFF CARS\r\n    Just a reminder: please park your car up by building A. Not by the lobby, not by building D. Thank you.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Steve from San Juan Pest was here this afternoon and said he may have solved the problem but that the little door on the office building in front of the tree by the van needs to be sealed up to prevent further problems.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 3:57 pm\r\n\r\n    JULY 4TH FERRY INFORMATION: Below is information from WSF regarding the FREE PARKING policy at the Anacortes Terminal over the dates of July 3-7. WSF is providing FREE PARKING over these dates since the smaller “Sealth” will be in service, which accommodates 50 less cars per sailing than usual. Please let our July 4 guests know about this FREE PARKING and encourage them to walk on the ferries. Also, please remind our guests that “Getting Here is Half the Fun” and ferry fares include a round trip. Thanks!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 1:52 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA SERVICES: Annette (who sometimes works at Lavendera) is available to do manicures & pedicures in peoples’ rooms. The cost is $85. for on site. Her # is 378-1084 or the spa can be called & we can arrange it.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2008 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a message from Samantha regarding res# 1065447. The lady was interested in pedicures for two people on Saturday 5/31 in the later afternoon. Called Sealy at the spa to ask about availability and Anette is available for in room pedicures on Saturday afternoon, but will need to be contacted directly @ home to schedule an appointment. I posted her number in Steffi’s office on the wall. Gio can you please contact the lady and let her know this information, she is having a dinner party this evening and would like a call back in the morning.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2008 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Numbers, Numbers, Numbers…I have posted a new Target sheet updated as of today. Take a looksy, great work. We’re really close for May!!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 10:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Room #114 called and said that their room had not been tidied so I ran over some towels and coffee and picked up their used linen. I was in a little bit of a hurry to get back to the office( busy phone day) and forgot to close up the housekeeping closet. Thanks to Regino he noticed it! Thank You Regino!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    All employees working tomorrow, please wear a white shirt to the Bird Rock party, black, chocolate brown or khaki pants are fine for the bottom:) See you all there.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 6:40 pm\r\n\r\n    A couple of things that I wanted to make sure got taken care of tomorrow. Steve from the bike shop called and let us know that bikes are ready to be picked up. Also res# 1147168 has misplaced a white ipod between here and California and wondered if maybe we might have seen it. Housekeeping staff has left for the day so could someone please ask them tomorrow morning. I did let them know that we would contact them if we found it. Thank You!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2008 at 9:44 pm\r\n\r\n    MUST BE A FULL MOON SOON….\r\n    Well all guests but one are here. #31376 is a remote check in. towards the end of the night it went really smooth. I had some fun EH people in the living room area playing Bridge. They were cute. Had a KNARLEY clipper person. I couldn’t how she pronounced her last name, so by the 2nd or 3rd time, ei… “P-R-O-N-O-U-N-C-E-D” everything like that. Then said the room # like that too. The sons were mortified. I laughed inside and smiled one the outside. Overcame my first challenging position…not to let my head pop off.\r\n    A FEW THINGS:\r\n    #1112884 they would LOVE a mini table so they can play cards! Their with the EH. Dont know if that can happen, I told them that I would ask.\r\n    #31376 was a late check. Please make sure he brings our copy in.\r\n    We REALLY need hot cup for the lobby…I could gets some from the coffee shop, but I didn’t know if we had some more stocked away. It is late and everyone had gone home for the evening.\r\n    Napkins? We need them as well for up front. Also, we should order some more 1/2 and 1/2 we have very little left. Should I order some with my next lil order with Gerard?\r\n    I’m trying really hard not get to sleepy. It’s past my usual bedtime. Well, I think that’s it for now. I’ll be in late again so no coffee for Cindy! Ha ha Kidding. I’ll make it whenever. Everyone have a marvelous day tomorrow, and see you at three :0\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    SUMMER IS HERE!!\r\n    Busy, busy, busy today! Steffi and I were running all over the place.\r\n    Steffi pretty much covered everything.\r\n    Morgan, I will be here at 10 to help you out, not that you couldn’t handle it yourself :D\r\n    Again, there was a couple that wants a massage s.b.s. massage. Their res # is 211260956. I left a message about it on their room answering machine, but they haven’t called back. You can read more about that in their guest remarks.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we are sold out! YEAH!!!\r\n    Couple of things: #1137861 was promised an upstairs room (she is from the city and doesn’t sleep in downstairs rooms), I was able to move her in one. Please make sure to write special requests like that, especially for longer stays, in the guest remarks, so when we have to move people around, we know.\r\n\r\n    #1146300 had booked a massage online, when he arrived the time we had scheduled it for, really didn’t work for him and he felt cheated. I took massage off bill. Khaili and I are trying hard to sell their 9AM SBS appointment for tomorrow morning. Morgan, if you have inquiries tomorrow, please keep that opening in mind. If we don’t sell it, we’ll have to pay for it. Please always ask for a time frame during which a massage would be pleasant for the guest.\r\n\r\n    A family called from Lime Kiln and wanted to be picked up. They rode our bikes and were very upset that nobody had told them how far it was and that the bikes don’t have gears. I called a cab for them. Khaili apologized profusely. Please let guests know that our bikes don’t have gears and that our pretty island is quite hilly.\r\n\r\n    The other 69 rooms? Happy!\r\n\r\n    Back Door Kitchen\r\n    My plan to put the menus in the rooms today was utterly unrealistic. Morgan, can you please start tackling that early next week. I won’t be at E until next Friday. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Elderhostel\r\n    Will arrive tomorrow. Morgan made a rooming list (on back desk). Quite a few early arrivals, don’t forget to mark them checked in tomorrow morning and print out invoices and make keys for the others.\r\n\r\n    Great job everybody, our first busy weekend. We still got it:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 3:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SMALL SNAFU\r\n    Please read the notes on Reso #1147263 I got it taken care of with out the guest having to worry about it. Cindy, sorry but we will be receiving a bill from San Juan Excursions because of it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 9:03 am\r\n\r\n    GUEST #211567570\r\n    Charged guest this morning for the room. Priscilla was unable to sell it. Guest was a UNIREZ that called to cancel last night for her Saturday night stay. I removed the room tax.\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well, sadly, we had a couple of open rooms last night. But I can proudly say that none of them were the rooms I put on hold. :D (jk) Only 330 is held for tonight at the moment.\r\n    SOLD OUT\r\n    Well I just made the rounds of calling all the hotels on the island and I am happy to report that only us and Bird Rock are sold out. Be sure to refer anyone who calls to the FHH, BW, RH, DI, & B&B Assoc. Don’t let our occupancy level get to your head though. I am still praying to the gods of hospitality that everything goes smoothly today. *knocks on desk*\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 8:15 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you Steffi for commenting about how it is nice to check in guests who are excited to be here, it IS contagious. AND the reverse of this is also true. Enthusiasm is contagious and it is OUR!! JOB!! to give that to our guests. In fact, Adam and I were talking about this remembering some of the wonderful feedback that we got about our great customer service last year. To be honest, a lot of that came from some of our younger staff who have had such a delightfully warm and cheery demeanor. I’ve noticed that it’s easy for our more seasoned staff to slip into a kind of dourness that is, unfortunately, also contagious. Let this be a reminder to all of us to ALWAYS welcome our guests with enthusiasm. EVERY guest deserves this and is PAYING for it. So, regardless of their attitude as they first walk through the door, it is OUR JOB to do give enthusiasm.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi summed it up pretty well. Tomorrows sold out!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    So far so good, couple of rough patches, checked in a wrong guest in the wrong room, a frozen fridge (Priscilla was gone for an hour chiseling ice away), blocked sink, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    is full at noon tomorrow, has plenty of room for their 4 PM sailing\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    updated through July, will do August next week.\r\n\r\n    It is such a pleasure to check in guests who are so excited to be here. It’s contagious.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 12:45 pm\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well… Due to a couple of “emergencies” we are now down to only 218 for Sunday night. We still have 215 and 218 held for tonight though.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    I have one more:\r\n    BOOMTIME\r\n    please put the processed (and accounted for in WRP as vouchers) gift certificate print out and put it in the cash drawer (not with the other invoices), so I can reconcile them when I reconcile cash.\r\n    Gracias.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 9:48 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BEGINNING OF THE SEASON!\r\n\r\n    INTERNET RESERVATIONS: Adding to Steffi’s comment about printing out these reservations, Cindy noticed yesterday that we have to print out these reservations BEFORE CONFIRMING THEM!! Apparently, once they are confirmed any add-ons DISAPPEAR. Yikes!\r\n\r\n    Steffi-Could you please pass that valve on Building F issue with Raquel and Regino? Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy\r\n\r\n    BACKDOOR KITCHEN\r\n    We switched from STEPS to Backdoor Kitchen for our room service. Currently all STEPS menus are out of the rooms. Morgan and I will put the Backdoor Kitchen menus with a new cover sheet in the rooms by Sunday. The procedure stays the same:\r\n    1) Guest calls BD Kitchen and puts in order\r\n    2) BD Kitchen calls us and tells us when the order is ready\r\n    3) We go get the food with our fancy yellow hot holding bag (where is the second one, the one which was in the luggage room? Tory got the one they had at STEPS)\r\n    4)We present food on a tray with proper silverware and plates and bring it, together with 2 copies of the invoice to the guest room.\r\n    5) Guest signs invoice and has delicious meal\r\n    6) We put food bill plus 15 % on guests bill and charge credit card.\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP AND THROUGH, NOW MORE THAN EVER\r\n    Morgan, please run down to ACE and get AAA batteries (and Regino a bottle of WD40, I took his to Bird Rock, he needs it). I was in remote control hell today, had to find empty rooms and snatch batteries out of their remotes.\r\n\r\n    When you have a rollaway or crib request or an Elderhostel early arrival or stayover, please write it in the HK comment section in WRP. No fun to roll around rollaways after HK is gone.\r\n\r\n    Please print out EVERY online reservation, highlight the special requests, process it and put it in the basket on the back desk. Had another missed whale watch today. Guest isn’t here yet, but whale watch companies are not picking up their phones at 8.30PM. So let’s hope the guest has mercy with me.\r\n    And make it a habit to double check those reservations in the basket.\r\n\r\n    Happy beginning of the season, everybody. Let’s keep our spirits high and stay focused. Another couple of weeks and we will have lot’s of staff and we will just be hopping.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 5:14 pm\r\n\r\n    VALVE ON BUILDING F\r\n    The gardener lady stopped by and said somebody had turned off the blue valve on the backside of building F below the spigot. That valve needs to stay on, it waters the hanging baskets.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    I have now put three rooms on emergency hold for Saturday night. Don’t forget that we have 216, 217, 218 held for both Saturday night and Sunday night now. We’re selling out quick so don’t forget to release the rooms back into the wild if everything is looking copasetic.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 10:06 am\r\n\r\n    Gift Certificates\r\n    When you receive an email from Boomtime saying that someone has just purchased a gift certificate from us, you must enter it in Webrez Pro on the same day. Here is what you do:\r\n    1. Begin process like any other GC transaction in Webrezpro\r\n    2. Use GC number from Boomtime, (to get this number you will have to log into Boomtime website to get it),\r\n    3.Please print off credit card transaction detail for the transaction you are working with from the Boomtime website\r\n    4. When you enter the transaction in Webrez please use the Boomtime GC number as your confirmation number\r\n    5. When you get the point where you have to accept payment in Webrezpro you will apply payment as a voucher. Then you will take the credit card print off from Boomtime and put it in your cash drawer up front and write “count as cash” on it.\r\n    5. This paper will need to be attached to your reconciliation report at the end of the night.\r\n    6. Don’t forget to manually enter it in our GC register in the front desk book, we need that paper trail.\r\n    Does this make sense, if not ask me or Morgan..\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Nordstrom Girls want a late checkout in room #314 they will not be able to get the belongings out of that room until 300p.m. at the latest.They will be checking out of all their rooms at regular checkout time they just needed that room to store somethings while out on their shoot.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    OPEN HOUSE AT BIRD ROCK: Next Wednesday, 3pm-7pm. Be there or be square. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell them, tell them.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 4:56 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH!!\r\n    Your opportunity to earn extra cash has arrived. See the bulletin board in Steffi’s office to get the full scoop.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG HOLE: Kaitlyn made a good point on the Bird Rock blog in that if you have posted to the blog about an issue that will happen while you are off and by the time you get back the issue will me moot, you can’t do much more than post it. All I’m really asking is that you follow up where necessary. Thanks, guys!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    MAKE SURE TO CONFIRM RESERVATION DETAILS WITH GUEST!! I just got a call from a woman who thought she made a reservation with us for July 25th. Thankfully she looked through her email confirmation carefully and noticed that the reservation was made for 2009! BE VERY VERY VERY CAREFUL, we ALL make mistakes and this is why you need to CONFIRM, CONFIRM, CONFIRM.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    Thought I would go right into my first question:\r\n    Gio, did you follow up on res# 1141580’s kayak and whale watch? I saw that you had highlighted those options and put the print out of the reservation in the basket, but in the guest remarks it didn’t say anything about them. The print out of the reservation is still in the basket.\r\n\r\n    My second question is about the incoming calls on the 378-8275 line. It seems like I answer a lot of calls on that line and there isn’t anyone on the other end. Has anyone else noticed this?\r\n\r\n    The man in 334 for the night is with the school board. He will be in meetings from 7:30am-4:00pm and I told him that he could just leave his luggage in the room until the housekeepers come and they can bring it to the lobby. He said that was fine, but he may just take them with him so there is a possibility that there will be no luggage in there tomorrow when we go to get them. Morgan and I had done this once before, so I hope that was okay.\r\n\r\n    Phew… I think that is all.\r\n    Everything has been pretty quite since I got here at three. I tried to stock the gift shop, but I couldn’t find the extra boxes of the gift shop stuff in the ceder room. Do you have any clue, Morgan?\r\n\r\n    That is all for now. See you on Sunday.\r\n    ~Khaili\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 4:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Congrats, GIO! The Caffe D’Arte folks came today to train us on how to use their coffee in our espresso machine and Gio earned high accolades from them for her delicious coffee and beautiful espresso art. The trainer (an award-winning espresso-art designer) said that Gio was AMAZING!\r\n\r\n    So, when Cafe Zia opens up this summer, you’ll all have to submit not only your taste buds, but your eyes as well, to a wonderful treat.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    JOYEUX ANNIVERSAIRE, GELUKKIGE VERJAARDAG, 生日快乐, FELIZ CUMPLEANOS, 誕生日おめでとう, FELIZ ANIVERSARIO, 축 생일!\r\n\r\n    Hi Morgan, I just wanted to add a little international flair to the mix. Happy Birthday!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLACK HOLE: We manager types have been noticing that the blog, while wonderful, has it’s drawbacks. Namely, lack of follow-through. You’ve all been doing a wonderful job at posting details that need to be followed up on. And, for the most part, you’ve been doing well at following up on these, but SOMETIMES, balls get dropped. So, NEW RULES: when YOU post something on the blog, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that somebody followed up on it.\r\n\r\n    TRANSFERRING PHONES TO CINDY AND LAURA: When someone requests to be transferred back to Cindy, Laura, the manager, the owner, someone in charge of something, if we are in the office, please do the following: Say “let me check to see if she is available, may I get your name please?” and then call us to see if we want to take the call. We may, we may not. We may be here, but don’t want to be interrupted. If we don’t want to take the call, please tell the person “I’m sorry, she is currently unavailable, is there anything I can help you with or would you like to be transferred to her voice mail?”. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:07 am\r\n\r\n    YAAAAYYY MORGAN HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOO YOU!\r\n    Have an awsome birthday, celebrate till you can’t celebrate no more. And remember you are only as old as you feel!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    The gentleman in 109 is having a horrible time connecting to our wireless. He is a close to the antenna as you can get in Building A. I have tried all my tricks but it barely connects and when I did get him connected it kicked him off after a few minutes. I have left a message on TechieChris’s phone. Hopefully he can find an easily fixable cause for this guy’s problem. He has a newer-ish HP laptop running XP.\r\n\r\n    OTHER INFO\r\n    – 340 is fixed and is open and ready to go.\r\n    – Regino is in 321\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 9:32 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!! Sorry you are not here on your birthday May 21, 2008 Wednesday..\r\n    Morgan will be coming by though on the afternoon, shall we say 3:30 ish, and we will have some yummy cake for him. Make sure to belt out your Happy Birthday wishes to him when you see him walking around the hotel.\r\n    Thanks Khaili and Morgan for getting the brochures organized. It is such an important thing to have easy at hand, especially when are lobby is full and we have curious guests looking for things to do. It is a great idea to put the doggy information for checkin in the front office in the bottom drawer, easy at hand and less clutter in Steffi’s office. Smooth procedures in our front office:)\r\n    Sorry Gio you where hungry the other morning, I am sure those nice folks didn’t mean to deny your growling tummy, try and be louder next time:)\r\n    Housekeeping items: Your chance is getting closer to submit any great ideas you may have for us to bring to our housekeeping meeting, let Laura and I know what you think, by Thursday am.\r\n    Tory\r\n    I took care of canceling that check, sorry again that those dorks took your truck and stoled your belongings. I will have a replacement one for you tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 7:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey-\r\n    So, just wanted to let you all know that I moved all the brochures to the back office(Steffi’s) and all the doggie packets are in the main part of the office in the bottom drawer where the brochures were. If this doesn’t make any sense ( very possible) just ask Morgan, Cindy or I.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay, quick question for Cindy, before I forget:\r\n    Both of the brochure drawers that we in the front office are now cleared, and I put the brochures in Steffi’s office where you said. The drawers that I cleared out.. what do you want to do with them? I’m not sure if you had some sort of plan or not, but Morgan suggested that we put the doggie information packets in there. Any ideas?\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 10:40 am\r\n\r\n    I forgot to blog yesterday, so a few things:\r\n    First, one thing to start doing in the morning is to see if we have any appts. with the spa, then to call spa and double check on the appts. Spa had a little slip up on friday, Ceily and I were going over some ways to make sure everything is in the clear. Also when booking massages, always ask what kind of treatment they were wanting (deep tissue, reflexoligy ect…)This is a way to prevent having to call extra times to the guest, so it all gets done in one shot. One more thing…When booking a couples massage, or SBS WE have to have the second guests first and last name as per Ceily or else they cant book the treatment in their system.\r\n    I’m going to share with all of you my thoughts about our morning breakfast setup. Morgan, yes I came in and opened early, the group was wanting to set up right when I unlocked @ 7:10am. YIKES. About all of the food…. Lots of yummy food, lots of left over yummy food that was then thrown away right in front of me. *belly gurgling in hunger* I was surprised that they had non to offer >:0 Oh well, I guess. It was a little rude I must say though!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 10:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    My first week day shift today! Whhhoooh. The phone was ringing pretty steadily so there were no dull moments tonight. I also cleaned out the brochure drawer in the main office. It was a mess, but now they are organized by category and will be alphabetized by tomorrow, thanks to my O.C.D. And Cindy’s, too.\r\n    Okay, so I KNOW that there was something relatively important to write in here, but I can’t remember. Maybe I will by tomorrow.\r\n    OH! Morgan talked to the spa today and they said that the spa amenities lists were gone and they had ordered some, so they should be here shortly.\r\n    Good news for the girls: I tried on one of the girls shirts that Cindy ordered. They are much more feminine than the other ones :)\r\n    Alrighty, that is it. I think….\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 9:51 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s BLOG! It’s BLOG! It’s big, it’s heavy, it’s good!\r\n    Lot’s of stuff today.\r\n    – Building B is mostly blocked out until\r\n    Wednesday so that Rob can nail down a problem we are having with insufficiently heated water in the rooms.\r\n    – Angevine Middle School arrived today so we will be hearing the pitter-patter of prepubescent feet throughout the property. The pool is, as always, very popular. Make sure you keep an eye on them when they are using the pool. They were playing with the rescue equipment earlier. Their coordinator has asked to use the conference room for an hour or two on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Cindy said it was alright. They also need to drop off a rooming list with us. I have already received 2 calls from parents wanting to talk to their kids but, with no rooming list…we can’t help them.\r\n    – The Nordstrom folks are going to be using the lobby bright and early for breakfast. They will be here right at 7:30 to set up. Sorry for the inconvenience Miss Gio. But on the bright side they might have some good food to share. :P\r\n    – 343 is a late check-in. I have left copies of her invoice in the room. She is a direct bill with the school district so it’s not a big worry.\r\n    – We are almost selling out on Sunday the 25th. I have taken 3 Earth Places (216, 217, 218) out of availability to use as Emergency hold rooms. You can release them as needed in the “Unit Maintenance” section. Whoo! Memorial Day weekend: The official kick-off of the summer season.\r\n    – Please ask housekeeping in the morning if 340 has been put back together or not. We haven’t heard if the A/C unit has been replaced.\r\n    – 324’s sink is draining very slowly. Please ask housekeeping to put some Drano down it. I could only find a small amount to use last night.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s about that. Remember: Don’t let the craziness get you down. Roll with it. The craziest days always go the fastest and the summer is always over before you notice. :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 8:14 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING CHECK LIST: There will be a housekeeping meeting this Thursday. I will be attending that meeting and I am hoping to get feedback from you front deskers on any housekeeping issues. Is there any feedback that you are getting from the guests that I can relay to the housekeepers? Are there any items you notice that are repeatedly getting missed? Are they doing a really fantastic job and you think they should know it? If you each could write up a “housekeeping wish list” for me, I would be ever-so-grateful, and I will go over this with the housekeepers on Thursday.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 7:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all,\r\n    We are going to be welcoming our first 2 employees from Muldova tomorrow:) Thier names are Diana and Olesa. Please show them our warm island welcome.\r\n    H2O\r\n    Laura and I have decided it is a good idea to rent out room 343 and see if we have any other water issues before we repair the ceiling in room 337. That way if it was only the toliet overflowing we will know. Please make sure to keep me informed on the water flow.\r\n    Bldg B\r\n    I have talked to Seth we are going to give Rob Sandwith a call. I called Rob he is going to stop by tomorrow and take a look, but it is one of the issues we have periodically in that same building, it has to do with having some pipes crossed when they did the plumbing years ago.\r\n    Victoria Clipper\r\n    It has started, we will begin receiving calls around 11:00am and 2:15pm every day to say the boat has arrived and IF we have guests checking in that day that is when we will send our van driver to pick them up, Please call Regino first if he is working, and then Seth. We will also be bringing our guests who are checking out to the VC when they depart daily at 4:00pm, we will need to call the van driver for them at that time also, this is just part of our summer protocal.\r\n    Just ask if you have any questions.\r\n    One more thing: I have ordered the girl cut front desk shirts. I hope you will all like them :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST SURVEYS:\r\n\r\n    You know that pile of paper sitting back by the key card machine?? Well, those are guest surveys from/for the Visitors Bureau. Please, please, please, hand those out to guests when they check in and tell them that we would be so grateful if they could take a minute to fill it out and drop it back by the front desk some time. When they come in, just put them on my desk and I’ll send them to the Visitor’s Bureau.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    please run to Ace and get us AAA batteries and a can of WD40 for Regino\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing before I leave–\r\n    I noticed that we are almost out (we have one more) of the spa brochures, so when the spa opens in the morning, someone should go grab some more. Just an observation.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 7:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Everything is going well. The Nordstrom group is here, and we just had our last check in for the night. It wasn’t too busy, but I can definitely tell that summer is coming… yay!\r\n\r\n    Steffi and I tried out the espresso machine (the little one in the back.) I was pretty impressed, although the shots were a little watery. Anyways, not much to pass on.\r\n    I will be back for my first week day shift tomorrow! See you all then.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 5:13 pm\r\n\r\n    #1138177 (room 335)\r\n    Taken care of, read WRP.\r\n\r\n    Building D\r\n    My inner plumber tells me that we have a “traveling water” problem, maybe water from yesterday’s overflow is traveling along lines or through the crawl space? Water coming down 335 was rosty looking. Maybe we should have Seth or Rob open the ceiling in 337 (see blog below)? Morgan and I moved the Nordstroms people out of that building, just in case.\r\n\r\n    Lobby fridge\r\n    You espresso making folks: somebody made espresso with the spiffy machine, unplugged the fridge to use the outlet and forgot to plug it back in. Now the fridge is defrosted and all the food in there is bad. I will starve tonight and Cindy will starve tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Nordstroms\r\n    Most of the group is here. They may use the lobby for breakfast tomorrow but not before 8, so Gio doesn’t need to come early.\r\n    Some of the group will arrive tomorrow, one even the day after tomorrow. All invoices printed (by key machine), just make keys.\r\n\r\n    Middleschool\r\n    Group will arrive tomorrow (list of rooms by key maker, group leader Mike Medina). Please make keys after noon and ask group leader which rooms may need futons.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    We need to get new locks for the bikes. I had to chase after a guy this morning who rode off with one.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:14 am\r\n\r\n    THE CURSE OF BUILDING D Part 3\r\n    335 informed me this morning that water was coming down the wall over the microwave area. It wasn’t a rushing torrent like 337’s was but more of a steady trickle. Regino is going to go take a look. We need to call the guest as their were other problems as well.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Not to much going on tonight, made lots of vouchers!!\r\n    Anyways, the night was slow, Friday Harbor House referred some guests up here who needed some rooms. Thank you FHH.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, room number 335 will be looking to talk to a manager about a noise complaint.\r\n\r\n    thats all,\r\n    priscill\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    THE SAGA CONTINUES: 337 STRIKES BACK\r\n    Well Regino believes that he may have isolated the problem in 343 and fixed it. A loose toilet hose was to blame he thinks. Housekeeping has got the room ready. We are still going to keep 337 blocked out so Seth can look at the ceiling in the bathroom. There are multiple paint bubbles of varying sizes that appear to be water-filled. The ceiling is also soft to the touch and deforms easily when pushed up. I believe that we may need to replace it. If anything, a hole should be cut so Seth can see what the inside looks like.\r\n\r\n    -May the farce be with you.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 2:15 pm\r\n\r\n    is 337 a WATER ROOM??? ha ha. not funny kaitlyn\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Big Rob has spoken and said the following: if it’s not leaking right now, no pipe is broken, so the flood originated from an overflow of something, man made so to speak. My trusty side kick M-dog and I will go in there later and flush the toilet and splash around and if it doesn’t flood again, we’ll open the room back up, keep an eye on it and go from there.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 8:43 am\r\n\r\n    Yes, there is another spa in town, but I want to make sure that you guys know to refer to Lavendera first and to Spa D’Bune only if Lavendera is full or if a guest specially requests something that Lavendera doesn’t do (e.g. side-by-side pedicures, haircuts, etc.)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 8:39 am\r\n\r\n    Wow, sounds like a crazy night. What’s the status with Building D? Did Seth get called?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Ach ja, ze Sauerkraut famine, bad times, bad times….. Back then, when somebody didn’t follow up on something, we just ate them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 8:31 pm\r\n\r\n    THE GREAT AMERICAN HOTEL NOVEL\r\n    Chapter 1 – The Curse of Building D\r\n    It was a calm, sunny day. A day so longed for by the business people of the small tourist-oriented town of Friday Harbor. A type of day that could lull even the staunchest of hotel front desk clerks into comfortable lanquidity. But not Steffi. Steffi came from long, respected line of Germanic hospitality-worker stock. Her forbearers served various hotels with distinction during such dark times as WWI, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and The Great Sauerkraut Famine of 1964. Therefore, when the call came from 337 her finely tuned customer service skills allowed her to leap into action with nary a second thought. Over the phone, a harried voice came crackling through. A veritable torrent of water was cascading down the wall in #1138719’s bedroom. Knowing exactly what do to, she sent her trusty side-kick, Morgan, into the fray. Ok enough with the narrative…\r\n    – Water was found pouring (literally) down the wall in 337. I believe it may have originated from the toilet in 343. I have blocked out both rooms for the next few days. I have shut off water to the toilet in 343. It may not even be to toilet because water was coming down the inside, bedroom/bathroom partition wall of 337 and the toilet is located against the outside wall. Who knows.\r\n    – Apparently the fan/air conditioner in 340 hasn’t been repaired yet. We checked some folks into that room and the fan was ripped out of the wall. I know that room was blocked out before, I guess it wasn’t blocked out long enough.\r\n    – Please make sure housekeeping cleans 334 in the morning. The guests were moved to another room that they liked better. House keeping will have to replace the ice bucket in there because they took it along to their new room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 3:57 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW SPA IN TOWN\r\n    Spa d bune, 669 Mullis St, Suite 101 (by thrift store), 360.370.5027\r\n    They pick guests up and have a manicure and pedicure person on staff, they do hair as well, so they will be a great addition to the services our spa offers (they have regular massages as well).\r\n    I’ll put their menu in our voucher folder.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    #1039804 (BIRD ROCK)\r\n    Tory, please stop by ELEMENTS on your way to work and get a check from Cindy for Market Chef, then go to Market Chef and pick up 3 vegetarian lunches for above reservation (around $15 each). Then put the lunches in the lobby fridge or better yet, give them to the super sweet family staying in the Bainbridge. They will go on a kayak trip on Saturday (but Market Chef closed on Saturday).\r\n    Then please add th cost of the lunch plus 15% to the guest’s room and charge the card on file.\r\n    Muchas Gracias.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BUBBLES\r\n    I ordered a case of Ch. St Michelle (WA) champagne from Mosquito Fleet Mercantile (378-4190). It will be here Monday or Wednesday. Gio and Morgan, if you get the message, please swing down there with a check and pick it up.\r\n    Let’s see (with our mouths) if we like the brand, if not we’ll switch back to the dwarf bubbles.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    I called Regino and he is going to do the van run for Elderhostel on Saturday. I told Regino to plan on doing the first run at 7:30am, Tory please call your sweet little elderhostel ladies back and see if that is the time they would like to leave.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    2 of our sweet elderhostel ladies would like a ride down to the ferry landing Saturday morning @ 800 a.m. Would someone call them in the morning and confirm with them. Res#1094245\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Our group #9792, is going to have Cynthia’s do the breakfast on the morning of the 19th, if it is nice weather it will be on the patio of the pool, if it is not, I have offered them the lobby area (Orca room taken at this time) Please be very accommodating and go with the flow (as always) :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 1:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Customer Service\r\n    May 22 at 9:45am until 1:00pm there is going to be a customer service seminar held in our Conference room. Laura and I would like all front desk staff to attend. This will be paid for and lunch is included. Please talk to Steffi and confirm you are going.\r\n    Thanks so much..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 12:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Bldg B and C are open for business:)\r\n    Pool\r\n    Morgan, previous employee’s using the pool need to be ran by Laura, Steffi or I.\r\n    Sun, Sun, Sun,\r\n    I know you hate it Morgan, but it makes me SO happy, we need some sun rays.\r\n    Reservation # 1133948\r\n    Is a direct bill, please put all their information in my box\r\n    Thanks everyone, your smiles are contagious, remember that.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 9:59 pm\r\n\r\n    SEVERE WEATHER ALERT\r\n    Well our favorite little red exclamation point just showed up on my browser toolbar. Oh joy of joys, apparently we have some “unseasonably warm weather…” heading our way. Well it’s supposed to hit between Thursday and Sunday. I guess we better tell Raquel/Regino to start prepping all the room fans. Darn. Just when I was diggin’ all the rain. (not sarcasm)\r\n    FOLLOW UPS\r\n    Sorry for leaving you so many Miss Gio. Everybody and their brother called tonight to make spa reservations. I left messages on the spa’s phone for all of them. A lady also left a message on the phone but didn’t want to be called back until tomorrow (I was on the other line when she called at around 9:30pm). I left her phone number on the message pad by the phone. She’s looking for June 21st for 2 adults and 1 dog.\r\n    BUILDINGS B & C\r\n    Raquel wasn’t feeling too well and decided to leave the faucet/toilet/spigot check until morning. I have not unblocked the rooms yet but please do so when we get the ok from her. Leave 321 blocked though because Regino will be in there for the next 2 nights.\r\n    LOST AND FOUND\r\n    Guest #1110444 left a pair of glasses in the room. I told him we would call him tomorrow if housekeeping found them. I had to run an errand for a guest and found them on the housekeeping table. I started to fill out a Post San Juan shipping form for you. I hope the address on file is the one he wants it shipped to.\r\n    POOL HOUSE\r\n    Ok. I’m serious here. We NEED to get either a sign that says the pool is under video surveillance or a PA system in there. It’s that, or I start bottling the Jacuzzi water and sell it off as an aphrodisiac. No kidding. I’ll do it. If bear gall bladders can be an aphrodisiac why not ELEMENTS Brand jacuzzi water? Any takers??? (P.S. I vote for the PA system. I swear I won’t abuse it by doing something inappropriate like piping some Barry White in there next time I catch some folks being …well…you know…inappropriate.)\r\n    That’s it! Laters!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 2:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Guess what? I got the Espresso machine up and running! Changed the gaskets, and now the process begins! First: Everyday the machine need to have a least a gallon of hot water expressed from it. Do not make any coffee until the machine has been checked by Cafe Darte! So about expressing hot water: Take the hot water only from the hot water hot water spikit (the dragon) It is going to take at least 10 min. Ask Gio for Directions! Yeah Coffee..good coffee very soon.\r\n    COFFEE TRAINING!\r\n    Cafe D’arte is coming up on the 21st of this month from 11-2pm\r\n    anyone that want to be trained, please join me at the shop! FUN lot of fun! Have great day!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    BLDG B & C:\r\n    Water issues continue. Rob and Seth are working out there right now. They may be able to open the rooms today. If they give you the go-ahead, call Raquel and ask her to check the rooms first.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 9:05 am\r\n\r\n    Guest #1097453 Has requested a continental breakfast for August 21, 22, 23 for the orca room. She said that in the past that Raquel has done this, but that they didn’t let us know in time to do so. So She is giving us an early heads up. Is this something we could do? If so she is faxing an itinerary with small food that stay fresh through out the day. ie..Cookies things like that. Anyway I have made an alarm and wrote in the guest notes about this. If someone could let me know the stats on something like this, that would be GREAT! Thanks\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 9:59 pm\r\n\r\n    NOTES:\r\n    – I think 310 has a dog. I was getting ready to close up and I saw someone walking by Building E with a dog and then looked back and saw them gone but the door to 310 closing. We should ask them in the morning because they are checking out on Tues. That’s a big no no.\r\n    – What’s our policy on letting former employees use the pool? I was asked by some of them tonight. *heavy sigh*\r\n    – Room 109 says that their fridge is noisy. It may need to be defrosted. The guest is planning on unplugging it for the duration of her stay.\r\n    – Cookies. I picked up a bunch of cookies for the party and pulled a stupid and forgot about them in the back room. Maybe we should put them out for guests or something… HAHAHA What am I thinking? We should horde them and stuff our faces with their sweet crumbly goodness. mmmmm…*drool*\r\n    – That’s it.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 3:54 pm\r\n\r\n    The water will be back on Monday at 5pm… Whew\r\n    Raquel know to double check all rooms that were affected to run, all sinks, toilets and showers to check for air bubbles, and brown water. Please do not unblock rooms until you check with Raquel.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 9:31 am\r\n\r\n    I missed the big fiesta! :( Unfortunately, Zayden (my son) had his first case of the stomach flu. I guess I can start planning for next year? I was realllllllly hungry for Raquel’s yummy food too. I hope everyone had a blast! Maybe I can see pictures?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 8:44 am\r\n\r\n    114 is blocked out until Wed am for Elderhostel kitchen workers. Please have housekeeping clean room when the water is fixed and they will no longer need it.\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy\r\n    ♥ Elena ♥ Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 9:28 pm\r\n\r\n    FOLDER FOR GUEST\r\n    There is a folder on the back desk for guest #1117923. Please make sure and give it to them before they leave.\r\n\r\n    Things were pretty much quiet around here with the exception of one room but, I won’t go into detail since I believe wining is not allowed on the blog. he he\r\n\r\n    Happy Mother’s day all you wonderful office mommies.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 9:26 pm\r\n\r\n    BUBBLES\r\n    No, we haven’t ordered more (we have a full case at BR in case it gets hairy). Laura was playing with the idea of ordering some through the wine shop. Laura, shall we check them out?\r\n\r\n    KULTURE KORNER\r\n    I just have to tell you guys about this cute movie I saw last night. It’s called L’Iceberg, a Belgian movie in which there is almost no dialog. It’s in the style of comedia del arte, very expressive acting, no talking. It’s the story of the manager of a fast food restaurant, who locks herself in the walk-in by accident over night. She survives somehow, goes home and finds that neither her husband nor her kids had even noticed her absence. She henceforth becomes obsessed with cold and goes out in the world to find herself an iceberg. There are moments when I thought: “Alrighty, I’m getting it, you can stop now.” But I also laughed out loud and the story really stayed with me. A very different kind of story telling. Check it out.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Let me correct my last blog, I NEVER mentioned my wonderful daughter Khaili, I truly missed not having her at the party, but I did know where she was, busy catching that softball flying across the base:)\r\n    Great bloging staff, I am so proud of you all.\r\n    Morgan, thanks for checking back in with Angie about the water shutting off. Craig with Vanderyacht Propane will be here first thing in the morning, he will be showing Seth and Regino how to turn the propane off over by where they will be digging under bldg C to correct the leak.\r\n    Morgan, could you please call Pepsi about the new face plate for the pepsi machine over by the pool, I know you may already have done so, but just keep at them.\r\n    Champagne, has anybody ordered more for ELEMENTS? I noticed we were getting kinda low.\r\n    Happy Mom’s day..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 3:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Khaili, I think Wednesday will be fine, it’s only a small group. Good luck with your game!\r\n    Happy MD everybody:)\r\n    Esspike Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 3:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Dear ELEMENTS staff,\r\n    I wanted to say thank you for the big porky bone I got from the Fiesta pig. It made me hear so much better. As opposed to hearing: bla bla bla esspike bla bla, I heard: Come here, Esspike, stop digging in the garden. Amazing.\r\n    If there is ever something I can do to help: I’m an excellent deer and fox chaser, I eat spiders and I can mouse. And sometimes I wake up when somebody is at the door.\r\n    Porky bone for everyone!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 2:43 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLOG BLOG\r\n    Low key day today. I informed Angie that water may be shut off at some point during the next 2 days. She’s ok with it just make sure we give her a warning before we do it.\r\n    That’s about it.\r\n\r\n    Happy Mothers Day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    I am bummed that I missed out on the fiesta yesterday :( I heard that it was great. We did win our softball game, so our team is going on to tri-districts. Yay! Unfortunately that means that I will not be able to work with Tory on Wednesday. Sorry Tory!\r\n    Happy Mothers day to all of you mothers! I got a little taste of motherhood this weekend thanks to the Ready-Or-Not-Tot(baby doll that cries and all that good stuff) that I babysat for one of my friends. It cried too often and was a lot more work than expected. I can’t even imagine what it would be like to have an actual baby. All of you mothers are amazing!\r\n    Everything is going smoothly at the office. Not much happening but we do have an elderhostel group that should be here soon. Morgan and I have all of the invoices and keys ready so we are good to go!\r\n    Have a great week! See you next Sunday. (And wish my softball team luck for our tournament on Wednesday. It’s “do or die” so if we lose our games, our season is done! :( )\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 10:23 pm\r\n\r\n    our early elderhostel guest showed up.\r\n    good luck tomorrow!\r\n    happy mothers day laura, cindy, gio, raquel, and all the other housekeepers.\r\n    steffi, you and i are missing out on all the glory and personal questions of motherhood ;) hehe i think i can wait on that though.\r\n    priscilla\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Tory, Gio and Khaili…we missed you today.\r\n    Raquel and Regino…you are AMAZING. What great food.\r\n    Thank you everyone for making our second annual May Fiesta a great event.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Wonderful party, we missed Tory and Gio, where were you??? You missed Raquel’s yummy food, and Adam’s great margarita’s. Thanks to all the staff for making today a fun day. The mexican dancing was spectacular, and Brian made rolling the kayak look easy.. It was fun. I can’t wait until next year. :)\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I had put Khaili on the schedule to help on Wednesday, but since she won her softball game today, they are going to play in Tacoma on Wednesday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 6:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, what a nice party. Thank you so much, Raquel, for the fabulous food, and Adam & Laura for making the party happen.\r\n\r\n    #1130542\r\n    This is a weird one. Elderhostel early arrival, but not on Elderhostel list for tomorrow. I looked through our rooming lists from Elderhostel and the guest was on there. So at this point I’m not sure if that guest is coming, canceled, or if we made a mistake. We will play it by ear. If guest shows up tonight, all is good, if not, please cancel tonights reservation and tomorrows EH reservation.\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Some guests had lukewarm & rusty water, could be from our water crisis. If a guest in that building has issues and complains, please move and accommodate.\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    hey everyone,\r\n    the cinqo de mayo party is about to start..food, fun, dancing , margaritas!!! not one you want to miss :)\r\n    priscilla\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:26 am\r\n\r\n    Please make sure every employee working the front desk writes in the blog at least once during their shift. Maybe for those that blog often there will be a ________????\r\n    As the season gets busier, it is SO important to communicate via the employee blog, otherwise we are all lost. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE blog all details. If you are ever unsure if something is a new issue or an old issue, I will never mind being called, if an outside repair person comes in for information and you don’t know, have them call Steffi or I.\r\n    Get ready for YUMMY Raquel treats.\r\n    Happy party.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 6:38 pm\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    will be arriving this Sunday. It’s just a handful of guests and they will be arriving individually. Please print out invoices (suppress pricing!) and make keys in advance anyway on Sunday morning. Please make sure Regino is on call for rides from the ferry. Last time pretty much everyone arrived on the 3:50 ferry and Khaili and I had quite a rush.\r\n    Same on Wednesday. Khaili, it would be fabulous if you could come and help Tory from 3.30 to 8.30. Gio, please print invoices and make keys in the morning.\r\n    Thank you guys!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone, Please if you have any questions about the leak in building C and B, call me. Thanks so much…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 12:26 pm\r\n\r\n    WATER ISSUES\r\n    A new leak was found under the foundation slab on building C. All rooms in Buildings B & C are now closed out until Thursday. Those who have previously made bookings in the Sky Places for the weekend may still stay there but that’s it. Hopefully the buildings will be reopened by Wednesday but we are uncertain at this point. Further updates as we know them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 8:20 am\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    WOO HOO! Got our first Victoria Clipper block release in the fax this morning. All y’all who don’t know what I am talking about come see me. Do it. Do it. This is a new procedure to most of you and it’s something we will have to deal with every morning for the rest of the summer.\r\n\r\n    LEAK\r\n    Regino says that Rob should be here this morning to repair the broken pipe. Hopefully we should have water back in B & C by tomorrow. Seeing as though you have to let the pipe glue cure before putting pressure on it. (Again just my uninformed idea)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 9:19 pm\r\n\r\n    I just noticed that the two reservations are unirez bookings and we have no contact info to handle the situation. I will leave this up to Morgan to deal with in the morning. Thanks Morgan. I don’t think it will be too much of a fiasco. This evening has just flown by. I feel the season coming soon. So nice out today. I even wore flip flops to work today…I know who cares. Blog Blog Blog!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to say that tonight went realllly smooth! Always is when Tory is working! So about moving the guests around, I was thinking that moving them around and not telling them isn’t right! Hopefully the water is going to be turned back on by the time guests want to check in….so this unfortunately means that all the guests that requested king rooms cant have one, and also all cabana’s are booked. ARRrgghhh. Phones have been really busy tonight. I feel like crying :( I’ll figure something out. If the all the rooms are not completely move then the morning person needs to follow up and call the guests, and move then THANK YOU!! Good night~\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Building B & C have been blocked out until further notice when the plumbing situation is handled. Phones have been busy this evening. There are a few checkins in those buildings and they will need to be moved in the A.M. There are two reservations left that need to be moved if the water issue is not resolved by the time of checkin.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Bldg C\r\n    Leak is found, great job all you hard leak finders:) The leak should be fixed by tomorrow.\r\n    314\r\n    New toliet will be installed first thing Friday am, please make sure housekeeping goes in afterwards, we have a guest checking into that room tomorrow.\r\n    Thanks so MUCH,, I am a happy camper now that the leak has been found..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:49 am\r\n\r\n    Blog\r\n    Let’s make sure that every shift on the front desk writes in the blog. Even if it is just to say all okay..\r\n    Leak\r\n    Bldg C has a leak under it, we believe it is underground, it is not effecting anything with the building, just wasting water, which is NOT okay. The Town of FH will be here today, to use their handy dandy underground leak detector. I will let you know the outcome.\r\n    314\r\n    A new toilet is going to be installed in 314, this should resolve the clogging toilet issue, the flushing mechanism was not working properly.\r\n    PARTY PARTY\r\n    Don’t miss Saturday’s bash, 3-7pm…\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 7th, 2008 at 1:27 pm\r\n\r\n    The blog was feeling very lonely lately so I decided to do something worthy (barely)of blogging about.\r\n\r\n    I put Seth’s number in speed dial on all of the front desk phones. Yes, he loves me now.\r\n\r\n    Also, I put the San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau webervations availability calendar on the Firefox (internet) toolbar so that when someone calls looking for a website and we don’t have availability, you can check what else is open.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN PR\r\n    The next time a guest calls for a nice stay in Puerto Rico, refer them to my friend’s B & B Casa Islena in Rincon. Casa Islena is run by my friend Lauren’s sister. Lauren & Brendan, who both worked for me in Oly run the Tapas Bar in the place. It’s right on the beach and gorgeous. Check it out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 5:30 pm\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON RATES\r\n    Don’t forget that we are charging summer rates Fridays and Saturdays from now on\r\n\r\n    FIESTA FOOD\r\n    Morgan, please get with Raquel tomorrow and order food for our Fiesta uh la la, caramba, ole! Also: please ask Sysco what they have in stock for ORGANIC fruit. If they have something other than oranges and apples (we have lots), buy it please (like strawberries, bananas, cantaloupe or kiwis)\r\n\r\n    R & R\r\n    will both be off island on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    We have a bit of a problem with our washers. They backed up (the commercial ones, not the guest ones) under building C. Regino is pumping the water out in the alley and will try to snake the drain tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I had the first overflowing toilet of the season. Yeah, Spring!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 3:28 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    The elevator leading to the conference room has finally stopped working. I believe the problem lies with the second floor safety mechanism. I took apart the cover plate so I could look at the lock innards and here is what I saw: When the button is pressed to go between floors, a solenoid moves a metal plate down over the lock prong on the door. When the plate is fully seated two buttons, attached to the plate, are pressed by the lock prong. On top of that security there is a small mirror attached to the door. What looks like a infrared emitter is inside the locking mechanism. I think it shines on to the mirror and then reads the return signal to determine if the door is fully shut or not. Rather complicated no? With the lock plate opened I could see that the plate was moving fine and that the buttons should be making a connection. I think that perhaps either the infrared emitter bulb or the receiver may be burnt out. That is just my uninformed opinion. Either way we probably need to call ye olde elevator repair person to take a look. We have a lady with us for Elderhostel who could really use that elevator but she says she’ll get by.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2008 at 4:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi, I’m looking for a room on the beach…do you speak English there? How big is the city? Do you know how long the flight is from Miami? What, you’re not in Puerto Rico? Well, where the heck is San Juan Island, Washington? And why would I want to go there?\r\n\r\n    No, I’m not back yet, but almost. I’m stuck in Portland (weather’s too bad for Adam to fly down and get me). I should be able to come home tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I survived my trip to Panama & Costa Rica. And, thankfully, so did my grandfather. Lots of stories. I’ll be boring you over teh next few weeks with some of them. Just smile and nod.\r\n\r\n    As the Panamanians say…Ciao!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2008 at 8:32 am\r\n\r\n    8:29am May 2, 2008\r\n    Got another Puerto Rico call. From a different person this time. She said that we come up when she searched for lodging in San Juan. I’ll check it out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2008 at 8:21 am\r\n\r\n    7:57am May 2, 2008\r\n    Had my first “Puerto Rico” call of the season. Almost got to start booking a room before she mentioned something that sounded a bit…off. I love those calls. They make me laugh.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 1st, 2008 at 8:37 am\r\n\r\n    We have a guest that checked out today# 1042884 that came in this morning letting us know that she has lost her ring. She may have lost it at the Bistro Garden, or around town. I have called the Bistro informing them to call us if they find it. Also I called the sheriff’s office letting them know to call us as well. The description of the ring is: Three different golds(yellow white and rose) all inter twined together. The guest says it’s a bigger ring style…so just giving everyone a heads up ;)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 1st, 2008 at 8:35 am\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    Elena the lamp that was by the coffee service is over in the sitting area, that lamp had a broken plug, you mom is replacing the plug (she is such a women of many hats :)\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO\r\n    I made the signs for Raquel so you don’t need to anymore\r\n\r\n    OUR LAMP IS MISSING IN ACTION\r\n    does anyone know where the lamp that used to be on the coffee area console has gone?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI MESSAGES\r\n    Sweeties, since I’m all over the place right now, have to talk to lot’s of people and don’t have a cell phone, I depend solely on you to make sure people can reach me. When people try to contact me, please let them know that currently my days off are Monday & Tuesday. Then please look at the schedule and tell them when I’m where. If somebody wants to leave a message, either transfer to my phone ext.3002 or write me an email. Just say “no” to sticky notes. You think they are your friends but they really aren’t.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    Diamond Bracelet was found, the captain that brought them over from the mainland from the tennis bracelet in the head of his boat when he was emptying it. Thank goodness he was looking..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 29th, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    CHOCOLATES\r\n    Nevermind. Found them in the water-cooler’s mini-fridge.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 29th, 2008 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    995921\r\n    The guest from reservation #995921 did finally call and cancel. Poor thing sounded horrible over the phone. That’s got to suck. Having that happen mid-flight on your way to your honeymoon. She asked us to ship anything that arrived for her to their address. So we need to send off the card and the box of chocolates. Seeing as the chocolates were already paid for by her sister. Well I guess we can get that stuff off to her and try to salvage what little of their honeymoon as we can. A small “Honeymoon-In-A-Box” if you will. I set a completed Post San Juan form and the card on the back desk. I can’t seem to find where the chocolates went. Any ideas? PSJ doesn’t have a alcohol license so they can’t ship the champagne. *COUGH*Unless we package it up for them and don’t tell them what’s in it.*COUGH* Well that’s about it. Laters!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 28th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation #8788, lost a tennis bracelet while they were on their way to dinner last night. I have called the sheriffs office and the restaurant to see if it was turned in, it was not. Please contact me with any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDDING GROUP\r\n    O.K. here is the deal: at 9AM tomorrow, Dan from SJ transit and his employee will come here with 2 buses. One will take the party on an island tour and drop them off at Roche. the other will be loaded by Regino (please call him, he knows) and then will go to Roche and drop the luggage off. Great!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 7:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Miss GIO\r\n    Good morning, gorgeous!\r\n    We have a wedding party here (see itinerary on back desk), who got kind of screwed by their travel agency (not enough information, loose ends, etc.) So, please be super nice and helpful. At 9AM SJ Transit will pick them up for an island tour and drop them off at Roche Harbor to leave the island from there. What we (the wedding group and I) can’t figure out is: how is SJ transit going to get 21 people in their tiny bus, plus the luggage?\r\n    So, at 9, when SJ transit comes, please get with the transit guy and Regino and figure out how we can make it easiest for this party. Maybe Regino will load our van and drive the luggage to Roche Harbor for them. The boat starts loading in Roche Harbor at 11 AM, they’ll leave at noon.\r\n    SJ transit:800-887-8387\r\n    Skip, the captain of the Koinonia: 360-293-5920\r\n    Thank you. Have a great beginning of the week!\r\n\r\n    Mr. MORGAN\r\n    Please go to the bank to get change tomorrow. Thank you for all your hard work and holding the ship down while I’m rocking the Bird. See you next week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    STEPS\r\n    New menus are in most rooms, Morgan will put the remaining ones in tomorrow. Please note: STEPS is no longer allowed to sell beer & wine to-go, since they applied for a hard liquor license. So it’s food only for us.\r\n\r\n    342\r\n    the door is dead, doesn’t blink, doesn’t lock (it’s just open), no key gets it to do anything. I moved the guests and blocked out the room. Please let Seth know to check it out.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2008 at 11:46 am\r\n\r\n    MAPS\r\n    Luckily for ELEMENTS we have a box of maps down here at Bird Rock from last season that, I guess we could share with you guys if we HAVE to. I will bring them by later today.\r\n    sees ya\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 7:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FERRIES ON JULY 4\r\n    Members,\r\n    As most of you are aware, the Sealth will be in service over the 4th of July\r\n    weekend, which carries approximately 50 cars less per sailing. Since this\r\n    is our busiest weekend of the year, the Ferry Advisory Committee (FAC) has\r\n    been talking with WSF regarding a solution. WSF has agreed to provide free\r\n    parking for walk-ons at the Anacortes terminal over the dates of July 3-7.\r\n    Please let guests booking with you over those dates know this by encouraging\r\n    them to walk on the ferry for the weekend. You might also want to post this\r\n    info on your website, etc.\r\n\r\n    As you know, there’s shuttle service on San Juan and Orcas Islands during\r\n    that time, and the FAC is working on transportation options for Lopez\r\n    Island. I’ll keep you posted via e-mail.\r\n\r\n    Deborah Hopkins\r\n    Executive Director\r\n    San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Oh able one! SJ transit called, they are also out of maps.\r\n    G + I are chipping away at the Elderhostel rooming lists, can you please keep working on them, since I’ll be Bird Rock heavy next week.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    BEWARE OF THE DATE\r\n    Oh guys, we had a bad one today #1109274. The lady called to inform us that after having been here for 2 nights, nobody ever came to tidy her room. We were on the phone to Raquel immediately, who showed us the HK report and there was nobody booked in that room. We called the lady back and asked for her name, found her and she was checked in, only for March 2008. Because she is here for 4 nights, I had to move other people out of the way to keep her in that room for her current stay. Not the end of the world, but can you image that in July, we checking somebody into an empty room when there is actually somebody in there? So, the reservation was a walk-in and one of us probably had WRP on a different date. It happens, but we can’t afford it. Please please double check the date, especially when booking a walk-in. Thank you.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 10:48 am\r\n\r\n    THANKS MORGAN,\r\n    Thank you for the write up on the HOLD ROOMS…\r\n    IMPORTANT DISCOUNT INFORMATION\r\n    Please see group # 10096\r\n    Everyone calling in for this event is to get 10% off the rack rate. Please read the notes in the note section\r\n    All San Juan Island Marathon guest will receive a 10% off rack rate special.\r\n    Cinco De Mayo for ELEMENTS, May 10, 3pm to 7pm, be there or you know be SQUARE… If you don’t show up you will miss Ms. Raquels yummy food.\r\n    Housekeeping\r\n    We are going to have a housekeeping meeting on May 22 at 2pm, please any front desk employee’s that have anything they would like me to address at the meeting, I would appreciate any emails with this information. It works well to have us all lending our opinions on how to make our wonderful place run even smoother.\r\n    BIKES BIKES BIKES\r\n    It is the time for us to ALWAYS have the bikes out, and remember to put them away in the evening. I was thrilled to see a couple taking off on the beach cruisers this morning as I walked into the office at 8:15am, what a beautiful day for a bike ride.\r\n    Overseas Employee’s\r\n    We will be greeting our first couple of Bulgarian employee’s on the 28th of May, let’s remember to give them a HUGE San Juan Island greeting.\r\n    That’s it for now… Smile, Smile, Smile.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    *IMPORTANT* BLOCKED OUT ROOMS *IMPORTANT*\r\n    Ok all. If you start taking a look at the calendar you will see up to eight rooms blocked out every day June – August. They are just blocked out via the “UNIT CLOSEOUTS” screen. Four of these rooms are held especially for Victoria Clipper Reservations. Vic. Clip. ALWAYS gets Earth Places. Any other closed out rooms are our “Emergency Hold” rooms for the summer. Emergency Hold rooms are held in place in case of overbooking (highly unlikely), online reservations with wrong dates (highly likely), and maintenance issues. Our job is to make sure we hold these rooms until the last minute and then try to sell them if everything is going ok. Depending on availability, Cindy, Laura, Adam, Steffi, or myself will release these rooms if it looks like we won’t sell-out a given day. The big thing is to never let these rooms be held if we could otherwise sell-out on any given day. I know this sounds complicated but talk to me if you have questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIT MAINTENANCE\r\n    Please remember, when marking a room out of service, to:\r\n    1) write the rooms numbers\r\n    2) the reason the rooms are closed\r\n    3) your initials\r\n    4) the date\r\n    in the unit maintenance description section.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 1:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Marathon May 31st, 2008\r\n    All people attending the SJ Marathon, is welcome to a 10% discount of our regular rack rate. This discount is valid whether you are arriving on Friday or staying until Monday.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 8:02 am\r\n\r\n    P.S. Congratulations, Gio. Motherhood just keeps getting better and better once the babe sleeps through the night. That is until they start learning the words “no”, “mine”, and “why”. At least when that starts you’ll be well rested!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 8:01 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n    I just posted a note on the Bird Rock blog regarding TripAdvisor and I realized that this information, while not specifically directed to Elements, could be very useful for all of us. Please read this post and also all of our past reviews on TripAdvisor. Figure out ways that YOU can make our guest experiences better.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Laura\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2008 at 8:18 pm\r\n\r\n    We have a couple coming for their honeymoon#995921. Just making sure if anyone ordered the chocolates??!! If not please make that an alarm or a reminder for a priority today. And remember to put their champagne in the room for them. They are arriving on the ferry that gets in @2:40ish here. Thanks!! This was a really quite night! 6 check ins. Rather cold tonight. I have done all I can do for the evening. You know…..I think I forgot what getting a good night sleep was like!!! I had like a sleep hangover for a couple of days. My babe FINALLY has the sleep thing down! Whoop whoop! Ha I’m crazy…\r\n    Cindy: I made an Alarm, but I need to talk about a guest that needs a refund with company card. Really confusing but I can elaborate a little for yah! Goooooooood night everyone.zzzzzzzzzz\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2008 at 12:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Great job everyone. Everything is looking great. Thanks everyone for not parking out in the front area. :)\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Let’s remember to put the bikes out every morning. Whoever is opening will put them out.\r\n    Fan in pool area\r\n    Never turn the fans off. If anyone notices that there is condensation on the windows please let me know ASAP..\r\n    Heater in exercise room\r\n    The breaker is off for the heater in the exercise room, please leave it off. For now it appears that the sliding door into the room does not have to be left closed because our dehumidification system is working fine.\r\n    Steffo\r\n    All deposits have been paid and applied to both of the upcoming groups(that we discussed yesterday)\r\n    Trip Advisor\r\n    Every guest that checks out you need to say: “how was your stay with us?” please encourage all guest to write a review on Trip Advisor or ELEMENTS website. We love all feedback.\r\n    Gift Shop\r\n    The gift shop looks great, thank you Morgan and Khaili for putting out all the extra inventory, and remember all ELEMENTS stuff is 30% off.\r\n    You all rock, thanks for all your hard work.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS!!! w00t! (take that bird rock ;p )\r\n\r\n    LATE ARRIVAL\r\n    Reservation #1107066 was a late check-in. He knows to bring a signed copy of the invoice into the office in the morning.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK GUEST FOLDERS\r\n    Laura, I have scoured the back computer here and I sadly can find no files relating to the guest folders. Didn’t all that stuff get made up by that advertising company? Come to think of it, I think the pages to be proof-read were kept on Cindy’s computer. I seem to remember the pages with our information were sent to her. I hope that’s right. :)\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Dave did some work to temporarily fix the pool electrical until the time he can get a new main shipped here and installed. So far the pool and the jacuzzi seem to be running nicely together. Let us hope it stays that way.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL\r\n    – Lots o’ walk-in tonight. Mostly our favorite Timberland Homes guys. I just don’t understand why their office doesn’t set up a direct bill account with us.\r\n    – A card has arrived for a guest who is arriving on the 28th. We need to put it in their room along with some champagne they ordered. Reservation #995921. The card is posted on the front desk dry-erase board.\r\n    – Two bags of coffee arrived from the roasting company. At the guy’s suggestion I put one of the bags in the refrigerator. The guy who does the roasting says it will keep a bit better in there.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. See’z you all tomorrow.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG IS NOW UP AND RUNNING!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK:\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG: Adam is in range of a computer and will work on the blog so that we can have that up and running (maybe even by tonight).\r\n\r\n    MUSIC: Adam will pick up stereo components so we should have music by Thursday, yeah!\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR: Now that we have guests, and happy ones at that, it would be really great if we could start getting some of that feedback onto Tripadvisor or other travel web sites. So, please, if a guest says to you something nice about their stay (and this goes for you at ELEMENTS as well) please don’t be shy to say something like “Oh thank you so much, that’s great to hear. If you get a chance, it would help us a lot if you could post your comments on Tripadvisor.” See, easy (and it will really help us).\r\n\r\n    As always, thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 6:53 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Yeah, ELEMENTONIANS, we Bird Rockers are so much more exciting right now. You might even call us “hot”!\r\n\r\n    TIMECARDS\r\n    Please keep them for now above the time clock.\r\n\r\n    WRP BACK UP EMAIL\r\n    Elena, I spoke with Cindy, WRP does not need to be backed up.\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n    OJ is not organic until Wednesday. Guests in San Juan suite will leave at 7 AM, I made them breakfast already, just to let you know, Famous Miss K.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please everybody, print out a housekeeping report in the morning and hang it on the clipboard above the safe.\r\n\r\n    WATER\r\n    I left 2 messages with the water delivery people. Please call them again if nothing happens tomorrow: 8-5218\r\n\r\n    MENU GUIDE\r\n    Found it! Tory, can I make that your job? Please update the menu guide, just like you did at E.\r\n\r\n    DAVE\r\n    Is on the coffee maker cable. Also: please let him know that according to the guests in the San Juan the jets in the bathtub turn on on their own, without water in it, that can’t be good.\r\n\r\n    CHRIS\r\n    Hooked up guest computer on first floor. Wireless is now working in lobby and on 1st floor. Password is BR phone number. He’ll be back tomorrow and work on time clock and second phone line.\r\n\r\n    TV\r\n    Laura will fix the TV in the Bainbridge tomorrow. I did not find the 4 back up remotes. Anybody?\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Have a call in to Kyle Wilson, key dude. I will make him make us keys which actually open the doors (what a concept). If he calls, tell him to catch me Thursday or leave me a message at E.\r\n\r\n    MARROWSTONE\r\n    Is all ready. Unfortunately some paint stains on the new carpet and sofa. Elena (who is working her buns off, thank you so much, bonita) will ask Raquel for spot removal wisdom.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2008 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n\r\n    JAVA: We have espresso machines! Regino found them today. I am very excited. Soon we’ll find the receiver and we’ll have music to go with our coffee.\r\n\r\n    PLANTS: The housekeepers will be responsible for taking care of the plants in the rooms and lobby. I met with Theresa (the plant lady) today and she said to water them no more than 1/2 cup once a week and then only if they feel dry. The plants should not need drip trays. She says she sealed them from the inside. Do keep a close eye on them, however, just to make sure they aren’t leaking or damaging the furniture.\r\n\r\n    TVs: I will call Brian at Digital Connex (our tv guy) to find out how to program the remotes and also to tell him about the Pay-per-view situation. We should have a box there with 4 extra remotes. Steffi, do you know where that is? Can you keep track of that?\r\n\r\n    ELECTRICAL ISSUES: Dave is waiting for one piece of track to come in and then he should be able to put up the pretty lobby lighting. I will also contact him on Monday about the fan/light (or lack thereof) in the Shaw. If you can think of any other electrical issues (other than for rooms 2 & 3) please let me know.\r\n\r\n    MANUALS: Great work, Steffi. I had been intending to talk to you about this, but I just kept forgetting. I was thinking that it might be a good idea to keep a backup copy of each of these manuals up at Elements, too.\r\n\r\n    BINDERS: Cindy, did you ask Morgan to get started on this project? Morgan, did you get started on this project?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2008 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    I contacted the flower lady, she will check in on Thursday. If I’m not around, please show her our baby vases, tell her we have 15 rooms and ask how much it would cost to supply us with flowers for our breakfast trays.\r\n\r\n    Please check if the recycling has been picked up (I put 2 cans on curb). Please start recycling and let the housekeepers know as well. We can recycle: paper, carton, glass (no broken glasses or light bulbs), yogurt, milk & juice containers, soda cans. We can’t recycle: plastic bags, aluminum foil, batteries, paper towels & napkins.\r\n\r\n    I put the manuals for phone, TV remote & espresso makers in a tray on our desk, please leave there until we get file cabinet.\r\n\r\n    What’s the wireless sign in now, does anybody know?\r\n\r\n    I started a box of dishes in the kitchen, with stuff I think we have too much of or we don’t need. Please add to it, or take stuff back out and tell us why, so we can keep (or get) our space organized.\r\n\r\n    I looked for everybody’s time card today (payroll is tomorrow) and I only found Soco’s. Please, everybody, use time cards until we have the time clock hooked up. Keep them on top of the fire alarm for now.\r\n\r\n    I’ll check in with Cindy tomorrow at 2, then go shopping, I shouldn’t be later than 3. If Jerry from FSA checks in, have him contact me after 3.\r\n    Other than that, happy guests, sun is out, all is good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2008 at 7:59 pm\r\n\r\n    PATTI WICKHAM\r\n    will stop by in the next couple of days and pick up a donation request (in my office with her name on it).\r\n\r\n    We had a couple of hours without internet today. Tory at Bird Rock checked people in for us. The wireless needed to be reset. Chris walked Morgan through it. All is good now.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG\r\n    All of us blogged on the BR website, but the blogs dissappear, different people see different blogs, trippy. So, for now, let’s use ELEMENTS blog for Bird Rock as well until Adam comes back and heals the website.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2008 at 8:18 am\r\n\r\n    POOL UPDATE\r\n    Due to the imminent failure of the main breaker in the pool there is now some new information. As you may have heard, the main breaker that supplies power to the pool and jacuzzi pumps/heaters is going bad. That means it is steadily losing its ability to power both the heaters and the pumps for both areas at the same time. As of right now I am focusing on keeping the water hot in the jacuzzi. It seems more popular than the pool at the moment. The pool’s pump is on to provide filtration but it’s heater is off. This means that due to this unseasonable cold weather we are having, the temperature in the pool is dropping steadily. Hopefully Dave will have a chance to work on it soon. Please offer our apologies to anyone who requires it.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2008 at 10:28 pm\r\n\r\n    The gentleman in room #310 is not happy about the hot tub not being up to temp. So he will probably be coming into the office to change to a jetted tub suite if the hot tub is not hot enough.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2008 at 6:20 pm\r\n\r\n    ERIKA SUNDSTROM\r\n    I allowed Erika to use our pool for a couple of months, 2 times per week (mornings and not on the weekends). She had a back injury and is having a baby soon. So just to let all of you know.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK KEYS\r\n    I made front door keys, which must be the most tedious undertaking in the universe (send me patience and strength, please). For now, nobody else should make those keys, please.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Please everybody check the pool and hot tub temperature at least once per shift and let Morgan know if the temperatures are low (hot tub under 100, pool under 70? Morgan?)\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    April 16th, 2008 at 12:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Please note a new special on the bird rock and elements websites: Sea/Sky or Sea + Sky. This package is a value added deal where we are just packaging our rooms with regular priced Outdoor Odysseys full day kayaking trip and dining credit: there is no discount, it is a convenience factor and a way for us to thank Clark at Outdoor Odysseys because he has brought us lots of web traffic (and presumably bookings) over the years. We also do not collect commission on this package.\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT NOTE: WRP is set up to scale this package automatically based on the number of nights and people in any given reservation. The trouble is that you and the guest MUST select the correct number of people or the pricing will be out of whack. I have tried to make this clear in the special description, but please be on the lookout for anything that looks funky (like, maybe a booking with package charges for just one person—that’s possible but less likely than two).\r\n\r\n    Good to go?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2008 at 9:56 pm\r\n\r\n    LEISURE ISLAND TOURS\r\n    Well somebody sure had their wires crossed. They showed up in their own tour bus. Regino and I moved all their luggage for them without incident. The baggage handling fee has been added to their group folio. We will just have to pick up their luggage and take it to the bus on Thursday.\r\n    REGINO\r\n    He is in 321 for the overnights.\r\n    OTHER\r\n    Busy night tonight. A lot of folks needing help with things. Kept me running out the door most of the night. Gio cleaned up the exercise equipment and she and I moved everything back into the work-out room. All we need now is to have everything plugged back in and the shelves hung up again. We should probably think about picking up some replacement weights. I have had to throw so many of them away because kids took them into the pool and they rusted like crazy. Well that’s about it. I am going to try and sleep in tomorrow but let me know if you need anything, like and off-island run, or if the pool gives you problems.\r\n    Laters!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 14th, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    IN-BOXES\r\n    Any invoices, everything which has to do with money, regardless of the name on the invoice goes in Cindy’s in-box. Everything regarding groups, again, don’t matter to whom it is addressed, goes in my in-box. All chocolate also goes in my in-box!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    If you have a chance, can you chat with Morgan about how we’ll handle Bird Rock keys?\r\n    LEISURE ISLAND TOUR\r\n    will arrive tomorrow at 4.30. Regino will pick them up (please remind him) from the port (specify where they arrive). Morgan will make rooming list. Keys and invoices (suppress pricing) can be prepared after noon tomorrow. They’ll depart Thursday at 9.30, again Regino will drive them back to their boat.\r\n\r\n    Have a productive, sane couple of days, everybody. Let me know if you need me (to go off island or something).\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 13th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH\r\n    Guys, I just reconciled cash and we had some snafus. WRP does not give back change. When a guest owes us for example $0.27 for a stamp and pays with a fifty, don’t put in $50 in WRP. If you do, the system shows us owing $49.73. You’ll have to enter $0.27 and make change in your head. So we better all go to calculator school real quick.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK TUBS\r\n    Morgan and I took a field trip to BR, looking fancy in there. We found that the aerated tubs in the Orca and the San Juan are one person tubs, not two person tubs like in the rest of the superior rooms. Laura thinks we should just advertise “tubs” in either case and not specify the size of the tub. So please do so.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK OPENING\r\n    Will be Friday, 4/18 at 10.30 AM. K, E & T, please be there.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home wonderful boss people! We missed you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 12th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    DEMETER BAKERY\r\n    made our little front desk and housekeeping hearts jump today by bringing chocolate-banana, ginger-lemon & seed muffins over, a whole tray full. Oh so good. I love it when people feed us. We are always so hungry. Well, Tory and I anyway.\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER ONITY DOOR\r\n    doesn’t open. Seth knows and will fix it next week\r\n\r\n    It’s Spring, finally!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 12th, 2008 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    We really need to figure out what is happening with it. It is really finicky. You can ride it up and down a couple of times and then suddenly it will decide not to work anymore. Or conversely it won’t work at all at first and then you come back later and it all of a sudden works. Do we need to have the elevator company do a complete overhaul? I know the thing doesn’t get used much but it is a real asset for the Elderhostel attendees and people renting the conference room who have elderly/cargo.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    H2O\r\n    Morgan, Interisland water will bring by some water on Saturday, before noon.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL HOUSE\r\n    Ok. The pool house is up and running. The water is a bit cold still. The Jacuzzi heats about 5 degrees every couple of hours. At 4:30pm it was about 85. It should be fully heated by later this evening. The pool is another matter. It is such a large, cold mass that it takes much longer to heat even though it has a larger heater. It raises about 5 degrees every 12 hours or so. Probably a little less. It is currently rounding 70 degrees so if should be up to full heat sometime Saturday evening. (I hope). Once the temp in the pool is up we can activate the new heater/dehumidifier. Everybody keep your fingers crossed so that we don’t have something unexpected happen again that would lengthen our time line (again). :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 1:39 pm\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    Yes, please everybody, go by the closing list in our front desk folders and double check that you are good to go. I do it every time, still.\r\n\r\n    ORCA CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    When booking the Orca room, please include in the guest remarks:\r\n    1) WHEN the event will take place, as in: what time of the day\r\n    2) OCCASION, is it a wedding, a funeral, a dance work shop?\r\n    3) Extremely specific info about the room set up, over-explain, and create an alarm for the day before, so we can set it up correctly.\r\n    I think we have a class there today and a memorial tomorrow, don’t know what times of the day. So please be flexible and jump when it’s jumping time.\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen: the building is open! All lamps are installed (we have a couple left over in luggage room), everything looks good. 338 needs art. 341 has a loose tile behind entrance door and needs a face plate in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    GROUPS\r\n    Cindy, Laura, Morgan & Steff: when promising a special deal for a group of people (for example: participants of the scenic byways conference or a wedding with no room allocation), let’s create a group folio with nothing but a note in it, saying how much the rooms are. This way all of us can look up Group Folios for the date of arrival and then we all know about extra special deals. What do you think?\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:56 am\r\n\r\n    Oops, I left my cell phone at my hotel today. If anyone needs to get a hold of me urgently today, call me on Adam’s cell phone.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:56 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I think your idea of just shopping locally for Bird Rock is probably fine. Just keep in mind that if the weather is decent, we could pick up a few last minute bookings.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:05 am\r\n\r\n    PLEASE, PLEASE\r\n    Remember always when closing that you are responsible for securing everything for the night, When I came in this morning one of the cash drawers was unlocked and the safe was wide open, coffee had not been emptied please try to remember, Thank you\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    101\r\n    will be rented this weekend with a quick fix to the ceiling from Seth. After that we blocked it out for some serious ceiling patching.\r\n\r\n    211\r\n    is blocked out for a week, we are waiting for a faucet for the tub.\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock Food\r\n    I ordered Champagne (2 cases small, 1 case big) for BR from Market Chef. When they call, please get check from Cindy and bring Champagne to BR.\r\n    I ordered our old scone mix from FSA. Jerry will bring it by ELEMENTS on Monday.\r\n    I think I won’t do a large food order for the opening, but rather go shopping locally the Thursday before we open to get us through the weekend. I don’t want to risk buying large quantities of things and then not having a proper place to put them. What do you all think?\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI The Lavendera Day spa is closed this Sunday/Monday for “spring cleaning”\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 2:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Just let ya’ll know…Room 201 is being blocked off until the 15th. Reason being is that apparently the leak from the bath is so bad that it leaks like a water fall right above the sink in 101!! We had to move a couple of really nice ladies today. They understood that things just happen, and not for us or them to worry. Very nice people. Anyhoo.. I sent Seth to work on in it ASAP. He will keep us posted and up to date! Wheew! :/\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Coast to Coast graphics shipment has arrived. Yeah!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    There was something a little fishy about our e-mail this evening. E-mails not coming in…I had an on line reservation show up in new bookings but not in outlook.\r\n\r\n    Whales were sighted by Maya today again. They have room tomorrow and friday. The hot tub and pool are still heating. There was a glitch with the electrical system back there (morgan has details) and to make a long story short…the pool has to heat before the hot tub can heat…so the hot tub is still out of service. The pool is heating very s-l-o-w-l-y. We did have a couple of very cute young customers go in for a dip. There was much squeeling and giggling and yelping. I don’t think they stayed in very long.\r\n\r\n    I had a guest call and say that their message light was blinking. Wow. I never learned how that worked. Can someone fill me in? Can people call and leave guests voice mail? If so…how will the next guest not get the same message if the first person does not retrieve it?\r\n\r\n    I am working on getting photos in all of building D. I had to order some more paper and it should be here in the next two days. FYI. Then I will be checking out all the other rooms and re-arranging and making sure all the photos match the “theme”\r\n\r\n    Oh, and by the time my “chocolate” capris get here…I probably won’t have any more shifts. Go figure.\r\n\r\n    Did you know they finally have life photos of the Giant Squid taken last year? cool hugh?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is staying in 320 for two days. Had a really wild night with some walk-ins. Boosin’ folks ;) Wow. The night is over and not a thing left to do. Have a good mornin.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    J Pod again today! They came down the West Side from the North this morning. We left them this afternoon headed south near Hein Bank.\r\n\r\n    Maya has a trip tomorrow at 10 AM and 1:00 PM with room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    COAST TO COAST GRAPHICS\r\n    Hopefully a gentleman named Sam will call and want to give us a FedEx tracking number. That number should correspond to 3 boxes of new Bird Rock letterhead, envelopes, and business cards. He said that they arrived today and that someone signed for it. No one here has any recollection of these boxes arriving. Hopefully we can use this tracking number to determined who signed for them. Thanks!!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 12:46 pm\r\n\r\n    what i learned today….\r\n    we use natural cleaning products….that have an orange fragrance. We have hypo-allergenic bedding and synthetic goose down pillows. We use propane gas to heat our water and electric heaters for our room heat.\r\n\r\n    If we book the WIND PLACE we need to know how they want the beds set up…EVEN if its booked on line. It is a “booking option” and we need to get clarification on it. The Orca storage room key is NOT the same as the Orca conference room key.\r\n\r\n    We have to go into the reservations to double check them when we are printing them from on-line reservations. The pool looks to be up and running tomorrow. Just very cold.\r\n\r\n    When we make new keys for existing checkins…it deletes all other cards for that room.\r\n\r\n    And….it seems like we are doing a whole lot more work up here at the front desk than we used to.\r\n    cheers\r\n    kj\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 10:02 am\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    They have a trip going out today and Thursday at noon.\r\n    FERRIES\r\n    They seem to be having some trouble so the 11:05 to Anacortes has been canceled. The 1:45 to Ana. is still go though because it came from Sidney. The 9:30 from Ana. was canceled and the jury is still out on whether or not the 2:45 from Ana. will be canceled as well. Apparently the Hyak has developed steering problems. Is it just me or have the ferries been breaking down A LOT more in the past year than usual. You’d think with the amount of money they charge us to get here they could afford ferry upkeep or at least a new boat or two. ARRRRR!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 5:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Susan Matthews\r\n    will stop by tomorrow to have a look at the conference center. Please call Elderhostel and make sure they aren’t in and then show her the room. If she is interested in renting it for her Thursday event, give it to her for $100\r\n\r\n    116\r\n    needs an alarm clock, please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Morgan worked on the hot tub all day. It is done & currently heating up. Painters are almost done. Dave & sons are currently connecting the fans. Regino pressure washed the floor.\r\n    Tomorrow Jared will take the platform down, Morgan will vacuum and clean the pool, voila!\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    Elena hung lists on every room door, describing the furniture going in those rooms. Regino & the girls are assembling away, prioritizing the rooms we will rent first.\r\n    Tory assembled BR keys. I made a food order list, have a meeting with FSA on Thursday, and will make sure we have ingredients on the 18th. Dwight will do the Marrowstone hot tub on Thursday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    ONITY\r\n    Tomorrow some Onity tech will call. He/She will want us to hook up the key making machine to the phone line. We have to use the line going into the fax machine because it doesn’t go through the regular phone system. Take the phone line out of the fax and plug it into the back of the key machine. Then follow the instructions from the Onity tech person. Call my cell phone when they call if you need help.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Aargh…I think I’m having work withdrawals. Okay, maybe not. The weather here in San Diego is chilly by their standards and delightful by ours. I know, I know, I’m too lucky for words.\r\n\r\n    BOXES-Just a reminder that when packages come in, whether they come to the front office or get delivered back to Raquel, please let me know what has arrived. I’m anxiously awaiting several items…\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK-I’ve been looking through the reservations and this spring, while we’re still so new, I would like you guys to please upgrade guests on arrival, space permitting.\r\n\r\n    I will bring back a little sunshine for all of you. If there’s anything else you want, let me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 6th, 2008 at 3:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Rats, I wanted Mr. Esspike to work my shift tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BANK\r\n    Elena, please go to the bank first chance tomorrow morning. Deposit is in safe.\r\n\r\n    CLOCKING IN\r\n    Tomorrow morning we all clock in again, yippieh!\r\n\r\n    KULTURE KORNER\r\n    La musica: Ever heard of Gogol Bordello? It’s Gypsy Punk from Romania, where the singer’s family ended up after getting kicked out of Kiev after Tschernobyl. I love it, reminds me of Leningrad Cowboys, but gypsier. They played in Seattle the other day. If you ever get a chance, go see them.\r\n    La Literatura: Nadine Gordimer is a South African fiction writer. I’m deep into “Get a life”, the story of a couple, he ecologist, she advertisement, grappling with alienation after being forced apart by cancer treatment (he is radioactive after chemotherapy and a danger to his wife and child, after a life long battle against the building of nuclear reactors, ironic, ain’t it?).\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 6th, 2008 at 8:30 am\r\n\r\n    DOGGIES\r\n    Just a reminder. I know Cindy and Laura are gone this week, but I need to let Mr. Esspike, Mr. Zeus, Mr. Thor and Ms. Roxy know that they are not allowed to come play in the office for a while. From today, April 6th to Thursday April 10th there is a guest with a *very* animal-phobic daughter staying with us. Reservation #1036575. Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    has a manicure & pedicure person on call, who can give manicures & pedicures in guest rooms or at the spa after 6 PM. Please call spa to make appointments.\r\n    They will bring us their daily schedule every morning, have Morgan or I explain to you how to read it.\r\n\r\n    DIVE GROUP\r\n    may need a ride to the port tomorrow around 8:15 AM. Most of the group thinks it’s not necessary, unless it rains real hard.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    will arrive via remote check-in tomorrow. Please start making their invoices and keys after noon.\r\n\r\n    NEW SCHEDULE\r\n    is up\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    is updated through June\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 4:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Ivan from Western Prince called and said they had an awesome trip today. They saw the residential J pod. And wanted to let everyone know that they will be going out tomorrow at 1200 again.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    I’m expecting a FedEx package from Lamps Plus on Wednesday, April 9th. When it comes, will you please call Dave Radden and let him know that it has arrived. Thank you!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Bike number 7 has a flat and needs to be taken to the bike shop at some point tomorrow. What a night! The last official problem was searching for the headset in the bushes.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, thank you Laura.\r\n    Here on the front it got even better:\r\n    the dive group scheduled for arrival tomorrow, showed up today (not our mistake). We got them in. Morgan, the heroic, picked them up, interrupting his dinner, while Tory and I rearranged the hotel so we could fit them in.\r\n\r\n    Cindy called and wanted us all to utilize the Unit Maintenance feature on WRP as follows: when marking a room out of service, write in the “Description” section: room #, why room is out of service, you initials and date.\r\n\r\n    Also: Please select a couple of T-shirts from the gift shop and start wearing UNIFORM, chocolate brown pants, skirt or longish shorts and ELEMENTS merchandise on top.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Thank you so much for your help today. You are the BEST.\r\n    Rooming list for dive group on back desk.\r\n    Can you please ask Seth tomorrow if he fixed the toilet in 309?\r\n    Also: do you know if we can consolidate guest profiles in WRP like we used to in Rezo? We have about 450 different entries for Emerald Glass, for example.\r\n    See you at 12.30.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Once again, you guys ROCK!\r\n    Yes, once in a while mistakes get made.\r\n    Yes, once in a while we fall into a pool.\r\n    Yes, once in a while we get stressed out.\r\n    But in the end, you guys are all so amazing and I am proud and honored to be working with you.\r\n    Thank you all for caring.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hoo Boy, almost sold out!\r\n\r\n    201 & 202\r\n    We checked guests into those rooms and they were not cleaned. Thanks God we had 2 open rooms available.\r\n\r\n    SPA DRAMA\r\n    We had a couple, who thought they have a massage tomorrow at 5 Pm, but the spa had them down for today at 5 PM. The reservation just said the time but not the day of the treatment. Always, always, always write:\r\n    1) what kind of treatment (how long, how many guests)\r\n    2) what time\r\n    3) what day\r\n    4) confirmed, fee added, voucher made\r\n    We rescheduled our guest’s other itinerary items and all was good in the end, but 2 therapists waited for over an hour for nothing. Please, don’t drop the ball!\r\n\r\n    BOOM TIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    The guest buying an online gift certificate gets charged automatically by boom time. We get an email.\r\n    1)Print it out\r\n    2) make gift certificate in WRP by changing guest status to “gift certificate only”\r\n    3) charge as gift certificate in payment screen (where cash/check/voucher payments are)\r\n    4) use same number as boom time gift certificate (if that number is already taken make it for example 5005-B for boom time, but keep the same number\r\n    5) put hard copy in basket with your initials and gift certificate number for another staff to double check.\r\n    Let me show you this one the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON BLUES\r\n    Gio & Tory, this one is for you. I could see it in your eyes over the last couple of days, thinking: “Holy s#@%!! What have I gotten myself into?”\r\n    When I was just a little puppy in the hotel industry last year and my entire body twitched every time the phone rang and I wrote down everything only to find later that I couldn’t read my own handwriting, the very wise Cindy, also known as the one who stays calm in brutal situations, said to me: “It’s going to get easier in the summer.” I thought:” How, how? How will 73 check-ins be easier than 52?” But it’s true. The month of May will be hard, very hard and then June will come and we will rock, plenty of staff, we will move our hips to Adam’s excellent music, it will be busy, a rush, fun. We will check the phone messages even before beautiful Laura can point out that the message light is blinking and forgotten will be how stressful it was to be all by yourself holding 5 balls in the air (I sure do like the balls, don’t I). Guys, we can do this, hang in there, the wise lady is right: it will get easier!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    DAY SPA\r\n    From now on the day spa will try to remember to fax us a copy of their schedule every night before they close. That means, on Friday night they will send us their availability schedule for Saturday. Then on Saturday night they will fax us their availability for Sunday. And so on and so forth. Hopefully this will help us to help guests with last minute bookings day of. Now remember this schedule is not law. Only a vague idea. At anytime after faxing us the schedule a given opening might be booked before you do. Just use it as a general guide.\r\n    OK? Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    ONITY\r\n    Within the next 2-3 days or so some Onity tech will call. He/She will want us to hook up the key making machine to the phone line. We have to use the line going into the fax machine because it doesn’t go through the regular phone system. Take the phone line out of the fax and plug it into the back of the key machine. Then follow the instructions from the Onity tech person. If you have any problems, or if your code doesn’t let you do what they want. Steffi, Cindy, or I have master codes. Call me if neither one of these people are around. Thanks all!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    The next food handler test is: April 17th at 9:00am, the location for the test is: District 3 Fire Station at 1011 Mullis St. All employee’s working at Bird Rock will need to take this test. We will cover the expense of the test. There is also a Spanish version during the same class. If you would like the Spanish version please let Cindy, Steffi or Morgan know and we can arrange this for you.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    All water places in bldg D are marked out until next week. We are expecting a shipment from Pacific Coast Lighting. There will be 16 shades in the order, they are to all be installed right away in bldg D water places. Have Raquel do a double check on the rooms before opening them.\r\n    Garbage\r\n    Once again, please if you see garbage around the property pick it up… There are still those wonderful people who like to leave their trash hanging around.\r\n    I have the following Sun Places opened up: 332 (PET), 335,336,341,342.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2008 at 8:56 pm\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN FITNESS\r\n    is telling inquiring guests that we still give out vouchers to their facilities. I couldn’t reach them tonight. Cindy, can you call them first thing in the morning and let them know that we don’t, please? 378-4449.\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY 4/4 TO SUNDAY 4/6\r\n    don’t clock in. Cindy is doing payroll early. Please write down your hours instead. Clock in again on Monday.\r\n\r\n    COCO MONTOYA BAND\r\n    Were on a late ferry, had no time to check in before performance, performance will go unitl 10.30 or so, no way to get their names and info before that. Here is the deal, I let them just ring the night manager and check in the rooms and get some rest. They will come into the offcie tomorrow morning and pay for their rooms. They may need more rooms than the allocation or less, we will adjust everything tomorrow. If we have trouble, like monetary loss, Sandy Cameron, the Performance Manager of the theater guaranteed to have the theater cover our losses.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK EARPLUGS\r\n    done and in my office (yeah Kaitlyn)\r\n\r\n    VISITOR’S BUREAU SURVEY\r\n    next to Onity machine. Give to guests to fill out and give back to us. SJVB will enter them into a drawing for a free stay in the islands.\r\n\r\n    LOVE & RESPECT\r\n    conference participants will get Earth places for $89, conference is in the end of April, no group folio made.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2008 at 4:56 pm\r\n\r\n    If any boxes come for Bird Rock, Elements, me or my mom, please, please, please email me with what is in the box and put it in my office. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n    Elena :) Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    There are goody bags in the back office for the FAM tour group that will be coming on Friday Please be sure to have them in the rooms for them when they arrive.\r\n\r\n    WHY?\r\n    does anyone know why room 108 is out of service there is nothing in the log, no clear maintenance slip, etc. Please have Seth check it out ASAP- Thanks\r\n\r\n    POOL PATIO GATE LOCK\r\n    Does anyone know where the key is? The gate is locked and I can’t find the key, I have tried a bunch, but no luck. We need to get that gate open so we can get the bikes out without having to navigate the tools, drop clothes, and lumber in the pool.\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that rm 110 needs a quick tidy, I had to move the guest last night\r\n\r\n    The Blog is giving me a hard time posting\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 9:54 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I figured out the below reservation dilemma. Please read the notes in file 1017323\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 9:15 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Did you already move 1017323? When I pulled up the reservation number it looked like it was all taken care of? You are correct, if the guest did have a reservation for earlier then June, and wanted to move it to June, we would need to have a deposit, and we for this time, it would be alright to apply the 10% deposit from his old reservation to his new one. Usually we don’t do this, and he would have to pay for another 10% deposit. If you have already moved the reservation as it looks to me to June, you need to make sure you write notes about what the previous reservation was and that he wanted to move it and ETC.. Thanks\r\n    Laura\r\n    Are you getting lost in the boxes and the furniture? Hang it there the light is at the end of the tunnel..\r\n    Uniform\r\n    Please remember to wear the uniform we require, that should have been in place by the 1st of April. Brown pants, skirts or longer shorts, and any of our ELEMENTS tops. We will soon have a new womens top, but until then let’s choose something from the gift shop.\r\n    Thanks everyone.. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    117 & 118\r\n    They are moving to the Harrison House on Weds. They have a daughter who works via internet and would need to stay in the room as long as possible. I have ok’d a noon checkout but they want closer to 2pm. I gave them the option of doing her work in the lobby but they would prefer to stay in the room longer. Please ask housekeeping how late they could stay. Currently there are no checkins for those rooms. So we shall see. They will call before 11am for the verdict or call them if they haven’t called by then. Thanks!!\r\n    TRASH DUMPSTERS\r\n    One of the building guy must have piled a bunch of demo’d stuff into the Recycling dumpster. The Recycling truck won’t take it and the Trash guys probably aren’t taking it because it is in a “Recycling” dumpster. Can we call the sanitation department to empty that thing? I don’t think it’s been emptied in over a week.\r\n    CINDY\r\n    #1017323 wants to cancel and get his deposit refunded. He’s not coming until June but I know we are trying to be stricter about the cancellation policy. He wants to talk to a manager about getting it refunded. Sorry. :(\r\n    REGINO\r\n    In 320 for the next 2 nights.\r\n\r\n    Later all!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone, thank you for the wonderful flowers and the kind card. You are all so thoughtful.\r\n    I wanted to let you know that the French Fam Tour will arrive about 2:30 on Friday. I have gift bags in my office that will need to be put in each room prior to arrival. Morgan could you please make sure this is done on Friday morning?\r\n    Commissions\r\n    Please remember to write down your guest add on so that I can pay you your 5% commission. Whoever does the leg work for the activity is the one who gets the commission, not the person who writes out the voucher. Let’s try and remember to write the voucher out ourselves if we can.\r\n    Parking\r\n    It’s time we are getting busy, let’s not forget to park back in building A..\r\n    Congrats Morgan, the first one to try out the new pool. JK\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 6:55 pm\r\n\r\n    ALVORD-RICHARDSON\r\n    Ok folks. To make our lives easier and to decrease the amount of frustration when making a reservation for them we have created the following protocol. When making a reservation for the Alvord-Richardson folks. Make it like you would normally do, making sure you select their corporate account from the drop-down box. Select their pricing option and put in the name of the worker arriving into the name slot. Then save. Take note of the reservation number. Then press the orange button at the top of the screen that looks like three little people standing next to each other. That will take you to the Group Folios section. Select the Alvord-Richardson group and then, once the page loads, select “Edit Folio” at the top of the page. Scroll down the new page that opens to the portion that lets you “…add an existing reservation to this folio…” Type the reservation number for the room(s) you just booked into one of the three empty slots and then press “Save.” That reservation will then be added to the master reservation list. Alvord’s CC# is saved in the group folio notes. You that to pay for the rooms. Please ask me if you have any questions about it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Ha, you thought I was done posting for the day, didn’t you?\r\n\r\n    IF YOU FEEL USELESS\r\n    Go into the bathroom, look in the mirror and say: “I’m a good and worthy person”, or\r\n    Contact the other spas in FH and the island, get their pricing and hours, ask if we can send guests to them with vouchers if our spa is full, make sheets for our voucher folders.\r\n    Laminate new ferry schedules.\r\n    Go through upcoming check-ins through 4/9 and call guests who haven’t been informed about the pool closure and write in the guest remarks that guest has been informed.\r\n    Please write in log when one of those tasks is finished or tackled.\r\n    Thank you and thank you so much for all your work on the voucher folders, they look fabulicious.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK VOUCHERS\r\n    Elena created an accordion folder for finished Bird Rock vouchers. If you schedule add-ons for Bird Rock, start making vouchers so we don’t get slammed when we open. Voucher folder & accordion folder are in white box in my office, across from the safe.\r\n\r\n    MONEY MONEY MONEY\r\n    Please only use folio 2 in WRP if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n    Double check payments on reconciliation report. If there is an outstanding balance, research why. The only reason we should have an outstanding balance is for direct bills. Put in Cindy’s or my box if you can’t figure it out.\r\n\r\n    If a guest needs a refund, we will need to swipe or obtain the credit card number the refund goes to every time. Our system doesn’t keep card numbers. The next time there is a refund, get Cindy. And as always for refunds other than our errors, you’ll need a managers permission.\r\n\r\n    AND LAST\r\n    Always get a guest’s phone number, email address and credit card info to put on file. See #1070681. Kaitlyn, any idea how we could get a hold of them?\r\n\r\n    See you all Thursday at noon for the Bird Rock Meeting!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 2:09 pm\r\n\r\n    PARKING\r\n    As of today, please park your vehicles up by building A. You too Morgan, oh competent one, holder of the ship when boss ladies are absent. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    CLEAVAGE\r\n    Gorgeous girl workers, until we have the summer uniforms figured out, please dress unrevealing around the chest area. What I mean to say is: put a bra on them and T-shirt over it. Gracias!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Next week’s schedule is up. We have a 9-5 shift now and everything is new and different once more, so please look. Danke!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 30th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey,\r\n    Great staff meeting today, thank you guys. I especially liked Gio’s hairdo!!! (how was the wedding?).\r\n\r\n    Laura: Raquel will put her thinking cap on, regarding the easel. She hasn’t seen it since the event.\r\n\r\n    Raquel has a pet peeve: please don’t put garbage, like old flowers, next to the garbage can, put it in the garbage can.\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn: regarding below questions: refunds must be o.k.ed by a manager.\r\n    Those travel agent reservations coming through WRP, creating an alarm are UNIREZ reservations. They are just like the old inntopias only easier. All you do is:\r\n    1) take 10%\r\n    2) print out copy, initial and put in basket for somebody else to double check\r\n    3) turn alarm off, file email under UNIREZ, done!\r\n    We’ll work together Thursday (yeah!), make sure to ask every question you always wanted to ask.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for the wishes and gifties, you guys are the sweetest.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    309\r\n    The Toilet is leaking at the base. The guest in there is a plumber and says we just need to replace the wax seal.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    211\r\n    The heater in 211 doesn’t seem to be working either. Both 209 and 211 heater dials turn freely but the heater never turns on.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 7:47 am\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget when you are editing or confirming booking options in reservations to TURN OFF ANY ALARMS set for that reservation. (if relevant)\r\n\r\n    Thanks\r\n    kj\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Reservation #1064850 is a no show at closing. Please charge them in the morning if they don’t check in after hours. Thank you.\r\n    209\r\n    The heater in 209 suddenly stopped working. No breaker was tripped and the thermostat doesn’t do anything. I have blocked it out for the time being. Please tell Seth if he comes in.\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    Just a reminder the Hideaway has a check-in on Sat. Their keys are on the back desk.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2008 at 9:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there…turns out I am very forgetful about turning the outside lights on in the evening. I was hoping we could set up an alarm in Outlook to remind us to do that every night.\r\n\r\n    I have had some questions about refunds. Are we aloud to do that or is it just the managers? Also…we are getting some reservations from travel agents over the internet that set up auto alarms. I am not quite sure how to deal with these reservations because we do not have any contact info for the guest. Also…how are we recording/processing these reservations? Does the alarm need to stay on there? I sure do miss Steffi. She had the answers to all these questions.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day and see you on Saturday!\r\n    kj\r\n    from Laura Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    From Laura written by Kaitlyn\r\n    Downtown Dog has given us a flier for their services. If we run out of pet rooms or if people need to have pet sitting recommended while they are staying with us…they can be referred. They usually do not board dogs but can board up to 4 dogs at one time. They are left in a colony setting (no kennels) which is why they are restricted in the number of dogs they can keep over night. They also have pet grooming services if guests are interested in bathing their pets or want grooming done while owners are out and about. Laura has had a great experience with them from taking Roxy there and would highly recommend them. The base prices are on the flier they gave us. It will be posted in the front desk manual in the rates and info section. Take a look.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 26th, 2008 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    ok. does it all happen when i am working? i checked some nice folks into room 203 and it was dirty. wow wow we wow. looks like it wasn’t booked for quite some time. don’t know how it slipped through the cracks.\r\n\r\n    the lights outside were all unplugged. how did that happen. i had to futz with them in the dark not know what was happening. push this button plug what in????oh, my goodness. i finally got it.\r\n\r\n    Morgan answered my laundry room question and Elena popped in and answered my room alarm question. Thank YOU!!\r\n\r\n    There are a couple of reservation questions printed out and left on the back desk. Then there is an odd e-mail i don’t know what to do with. I left it in the inbox for someone with more knowledge of pulling up past records for this fellow who wants to redeem an old gift certificate.\r\n\r\n    And….the end.\r\n    kj\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 26th, 2008 at 8:58 am\r\n\r\n    TEST TEST\r\n    We recieved about 5 phony reservations for Bird Rock all of them with fake credit card numbers and under the name test test. Under requests; they all say This is only a test please ignore it. Are these done by anyone here? Maybe Adam testing the system? If not then we need to be checking the online reservations for Bird Rock often so that these types of reservations don’t prevent other people from booking\r\n\r\n    1073491\r\n    Said he talked to someone about a week ago about getting the Wind Place for $350.00 He was told that a manager would get back to him but no one ever did, I told him that someone would get back to him on Thursday (when Steffie gets back) he will have 4 adults and 2 kids and he wants it for May 9th.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 10:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Rez 1063784:\r\n    Still no word from this lady so I am assuming we will just go ahead and cancel it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHING FOR 108:\r\n    The couple in 108 was interested in whale watching tomorrow, i was able to get a hold of Maya’s and he has space for 2 at 3:00pm, they also asked how likely they were to see them so you can tell them Jim said they had seen them 2 out of the last 4 days, $69per person rate.\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS?\r\n    As of 9:57PM Rez #1033035 & Rez # 1061083 had not shown up, Morgan Knows.\r\n\r\n    Rez 970369:\r\n    He has apparently moved his reservation several times and came in today to cancel 2 out of his 3 nights so he now has only Tuesday night booked, under his reservation notes it said to charge him if he canceled again, I checked with Cindy and she said YES! charge him since we have already spent so much time going back and forth with him.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Well, today was quite the interesting day for me. I still need to work on Bird Rock’s shpeel. I had an interesting time with one :( Oh well my spine will stiffin’ up sooner than later. Oh yah…I took care of all the updates on the whale watch tour prices, dates and the kayak prices and dates. So our voucher binder is stuffed full of only the newest stuff. Yay me!! AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEFFI!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 12:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Adam and I have been donating some gift certificates\r\n    recently on which we have written “No Holidays” or “Excluding Holidays”. Posted in Steffi’s office is a quick and easy reference with these days listed.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 9:34 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Gang,\r\n\r\n    Two little deals today:\r\n\r\n    First, please (if you’re not already doing this) make a habit of checking the staff2staff blog postings at the start of each shift and make sure you read backwards to the last time you checked the blog. I think that some of us may be in the habit of just looking at the last post or two and thus missing some important messages that may have been posted a few days ago. Since we are really using this communication tool for critical messages, we all need to be sure we are reading every post, not just the ones from yesterday. Make sense?\r\n\r\n    Second, I have heard some rumblings of the front desk music supply maybe getting a little too familiar. I will be adding another playlist or two over the next couple of weeks, including a new one from Bird Rock Hotel that I think most of you will really like. HOWEVER: there is currently almost 10 straight days worth of tunes set up at the front desk, and if you’re hearing a lot of repeats then you are not playing the playlist I intend to be played 90% of the time, which is the “Hotel Blender” playlist. I know there are sounds on there that don’t necessarily agree with your particular tastes, but please remember that the music we play is part of our hotel identity. While I hope you enjoy a significant portion of the music we play, and that it helps make your work day more enjoyable, it is not something meant to entertain us. I understand and sympathize with anyone who may get tired of the style we have chosen, but that’s why you have your own ipods and music to listen to when you’re not at work. The music we play is for our guests, not for us. Please go back to putting on the blender playlist most of the time and just let it rip. Curse me if you must, and sorry for being such a stick in the mud; but thanks for indulging the marketing department our little quirks….\r\n\r\n    See ya….\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 9:48 pm\r\n\r\n    320 blind broke, seth came in around 8 30 to take care of that. thank you.\r\n\r\n    im heading out on the 2nd, and will be getting my wisdom teeth out the day after i get back. get ready chubby chipmonk~~~ you will all hear from me then!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday to Steffi, Happy Birthday to Steffi, Happy Birthday Dear Steffi…Happy Birthday to YOU!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Door is fixed. Seth will send off the bad lock on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 22nd, 2008 at 8:30 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Door is acting up again. I have a call in to Seth. If you don’t hear from him, please move guest to another room and block out 320.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 22nd, 2008 at 6:36 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    won’t be at work tomorrow. She is tending to her great grand mother off island.\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    We have a check-in for the Hideaway on 3/29. Left msg with guest to check-in at ELEMENTS, left msg with Dave & housekeeper, so they know. Keys on my desk, charge in Bird Rock WRP.\r\n\r\n    I’m off next week. I will be back on Sunday, 3/30, when I have come to terms with my age.\r\n    Love you all!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2008 at 5:17 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHER FOLDERS\r\n    We’ll have the luxury of being overstaffed for the next couple of weeks. Here are some things I would like to see get done:\r\n    Morgan & Gio: overhaul ELEMENTS voucher folder, make updated vouchers and voucher tracking sheets, create vouchers for San Juan Outfitters, delete vouchers we no longer use (Lavendera, restaurant vouchers, etc.)\r\n    Also: whoever goes to the po on Monday, stop by the office supply place and get a large folder, so we can start a voucher folder for Bird Rock.\r\n    Elena & Kaitlyn: Please create a voucher folder, vouchers & tracking sheets for Bird Rock, exactly like the one we have at ELEMENTS. Create the vouchers on my computer (Bird Rock logo is on desk top). Don’t forget gift certificates (for rooms, massages & restaurants, the nice ones on the skinny paper).\r\n\r\n    Other jobs in case you are slow and get bored: update phone list, print new ELEMENTS rate sheets (saying: higher prices in shoulder season FRIDAY & Saturday, create Beach Cruiser Release form for Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    Also: I want everybody to go through their personal folders on “my” computer and the Bird Rock computer and throw files away you/we no longer need.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please don’t forget to tell Cindy about the refund issue we are having. Please contact the guest and tell him it will take until Monday to resolve the issue.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2008 at 12:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi gang,\r\n\r\n    We have a group of French Group Tour operators staying with us on Friday, April 4th. We need to get little gift bags together for all of them (which Cindy and I will try to work on next week). Also, I just wanted to give you a head’s up that they will also be having a little continental breakfast in our lobby on Saturday morning. I’ve been trying to find them a better alternative, to no avail. I okay’d it with Morgan. Morgan, you might want to make sure that there is plenty of coffee available for them. I believe they want to come in around 8 (I’ll let them know not to come any earlier).\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRINGBOARD AT BIRD ROCK\r\n    On the Bird Rock Specials site it reads:\r\n    springboard ~ be the first to experience a san juan island lodging revolution\r\n    bird rock hotel will open for business starting late april. we are so excited to share this experience with you. request “springboard” with your reservation and we will treat you to complimentary champagne during any visit during the months of april or may. celebrate!\r\n    So if guests request that, please write : “free split of champagne upon arrival” in the guest remarks, also create an alarm for the day of arrival.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2008 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    We rescheduled the Bird Rock meeting to Thursday, 4/3/08 noon, here at ELEMENTS. Please be there (I have a feeling you might, since every person working at Bird Rock is on the schedule that day, yippiee)\r\n\r\n    I LOVE INNS\r\n    Kaitlyn, RE:1063913 Bird Rock: The emails we get from Iloveinns.com are inquiries only. It is our job to contact the guest directly, not make a reservation immediately. I don’t know what the original inquiry said (no phone or email, it’s not in the email in-box?) or what you wrote to Adam (forward me next time?). I canceled the reservation since there was no way to contact the guest. And we currently are not participating in any promotion with Iloveinns. So when we get one of those, or from anybody else for that matter (I got an inquiry for the Friday Harbor Inn from Purple Roofs this afternoon), you call or email the guest. It’s just like a phone message.\r\n    I’m sorry, famous K, it must be hard to read kilometers of log entries twice a week and remember every tiny bit. But please, all of you, if you aren’t clear on something, write it in the log, so we all know and one of us can follow up.\r\n    I’m thinking about how to streamline all the exceptions, groups, little things you’ll need to know. Let’s bring this up at the meeting.\r\n\r\n    320 & 107\r\n    Doors are fixed, yeah Seth!\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2008 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Can someone please ask Seth to take a look at the lock on 320’s door. It is giving the error that says the privacy lock is on when it is not (flashing red/green). He probably just needs to disconnect that deadbolt sensor thing until a new lock can be put on. I have made a temporary fix but it’s not a great solution. I made a maintenance request but please remind him because there is a guy in there until Friday.\r\n    Regino\r\n    His Regino-ness is in 321 for the next 2 nights.\r\n    Thank You All.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2008 at 1:48 pm\r\n\r\n    hi there. busy with the phones today. i had some folks returning messages from other front desk staff and upon looking in their reservation…the notes were very mysterious. Just that the guest was called. so…could we be a little more specific about why we are asking guests to call us back? thanks! (i sounded kinda silly with this fellow…hmmm, well thanks for calling back but it doesn’t say why we wanted you too…)\r\n\r\n    also…is there a way we can get all our misc. deals and specials for special groups and reservations in one place. some of them are only e-mailed to us from adam, some are posted on the web…some are posted in the blog… for us part timers…we don’t get to book them all the time so it is very confusing to try to find the specifics. we know there is such a special but i end up doing whatever the guest says it is because i can’t find the reference. i will try to get some together before i leave today.\r\n\r\n    other than that…you are all rock stars for doing this 5 days a week. rock on baby!\r\n\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    ISLAND BICYCLES\r\n    As of today we have an account at IB. If one of our beach cruiser bikes breaks (Bird Rock & ELEMENTS), just bring it over there, pick it back up once it’s fixed. Paul will bill us monthly.\r\n    Starting in May they’ll be open 7 days a week from 9-6.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Adam, just to let you know, our talented Elena is off this week (semana santa). She will be back 3/24.\r\n\r\n    Wednesday\r\n    I will have a meeting with Cloud, Maureen & Daniel about the food coop on Wednesday at 1, either here in the lobby or in a sea place if one is open. Among other things we’ll talk about sharing distributors for Bird Rock breakfast orders. Just so you know what on earth I’m doing here on a Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    Also on Wednesday: a special appearance by our fabulous and unforgotten LILLY!\r\n\r\n    Happy getting the snakes off the island day!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 6:40 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Elena: Did the program you used for those cool floor plans produce a square footage number? Do you think it could? If it did, can you forward me that info for each Bird Rock room? Also, do they have you doing that for ELEMENTS? When/if they do, can you forward me square footage info for those as well? Thanks Elena!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 16th, 2008 at 9:44 pm\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Raquel asks to print the following 2 reports for her in the mornings:\r\n    1) a housekeeping report\r\n    2) the WRP page showing today’s check-ins w/ stays & today’s check-outs\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 6:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Also to let everyone know. Per Cindy: there is a special room rate for anyone in the Madden family this weekend of $50.00 a night for however many days they need the room for.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 6:47 pm\r\n\r\n    DIVERS\r\n    I o.ked a noon check out for them, they will be diving in the morning and won’t be back until then. So they will need a ride down to the clock dock right around then.\r\n    Haven’t heard back from the group leader about last night. Will keep you posted.\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS\r\n    We (and when I say “we” I mean Adam) changed the price for the Equinox package (one night in Sky, 1 hour couple’s massage, $75 dining credit) to $387 (book Sky place, then add “equinox package” in “guest charges”.\r\n\r\n    Also: Sea & Wind places are excluded from the “supersize your weekend” promotion, just to let you all know.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 5:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Morgan!\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the tour of Bird Rock. I now have an idea of what is to come this summer! The printer in the office is making a funny clicking sound. You seem to be the printer magician so please check it out. Hopefully you have a quieter evening than last nights! Thanks T.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 3:13 pm\r\n\r\n    PROBLEMS (otherwise known as the plight of poor 101)\r\n    At approx. 11:30pm Friday night the lady in 101 called me to complain about noise coming from the rooms beside her. She was very pleasant but obviously distressed. Turns out some of the dive-trip folks were having a bit of a domestic dispute. A verbal fight was raging between one of the girls in 102 and one of the guys in 104. Doors were slamming, voices were raising, and I wasn’t going to let it continue. When I arrived outside Building A, the lovely couple was in 104. I could hear them from the parking lot. I called their room and told them to quiet down and asked the lady if the cops needed to be called. She seem sufficiently embarrassed enough to call off the scream-fest. I hung around outside for about 20 more minutes as they has a quiet chat outside before going back to their respective rooms.\r\n    *Cut to Saturday morning*\r\n    101 calls the front desk to inform us that water is currently streaming down from the ceiling above their vanity. She says she can hear children screeching and they have been up since 6am. The folks in 201 were having their kids take a bath. Who knows if there was excess splashing going on but 101 is now blocked out for the rest of the week. 101 had informed me last night of their possible desire to leave early and the little water show cemented it. 101 has been a supremely good sport and I refunded their stay and sent them up to the West Bestern. She was very nice and she says she will be back during whale season.\r\n    101 is now blocked out for a week and 201 is blocked out starting tomorrow when the folks in there check-out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 9:34 pm\r\n\r\n    310\r\n    The blinds don’t close. I moved guests to different room and blocked room out until Monday. Morgan, can you please make sure HK cleans the room and maybe ask Regino to have a look at it? (I filled out a maintenance request)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    THE BALL, DON’T DROP IT\r\n    Guys, please make sure to print out each online reservation and follow up on all special requests. If a reservation is for the summer, make sure to create an alarm for at least a week in advance to make sure we have enough time to order flowers, book massages, rent cars, have chocolate & champagne at hand, etc., etc., you get where I’m going, yes?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    It’s not news to us, but it’s still news to everybody making a reservation with us (our website says our pool will reopen mid March): please please please let guests know that our pool house is out of order and write in the guests remarks section of their reservation that they know, that you emailed, phoned, wrote a postcard, send a message in a bottle. We had several very disappointed kids today.\r\n    We are shooting towards opening it again 4/1, but please tell early April arrivals that it may still be under construction.\r\n\r\n    DIVING GROUP\r\n    Will check out Sunday. They will need a ride down to the clock dock (mostly for their luggage). I’m not sure at what time yet.\r\n\r\n    Check out the new schedule. Everything is different! Make sure you make yourself available for the staff meetings:\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock (all Bird Rock staff, including HK) on Thursday, 3/27 at noon here at ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS front desk on Sunday, 3/30 at 2 PM\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. I’m so proud of Gio and Tory, who did their first phone reservations and did great. Thanks Elena for putting your organizational hat on and making the front desk look immaculate. Thank you Kaitlyn for taking on the most complicated reservation request of this century and plowing away at it, you are the best follower upper on the team. And Morgan, well, you are my Rock, nuff said.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 8:14 am\r\n\r\n    Hi All: big thanks to Elena for making me such lovely gift certificate to take on my marketing trip to Seattle and Portland next week! Nice work Elena!\r\n\r\n    Also, there are new referral codes in WRP. “Family & Friends” is pretty self-explanatory: to be used when making a booking for family and friends of any staff member.\r\n\r\n    There is a series of codes called “Health Club Promo: ‘name of club’” because we will soon launch a new marketing campaign in cooperation with health and fitness clubs in Seattle, Portland, Anacortes and Bellingham. I really need these tracked well, so please take care to select the proper code.\r\n\r\n    Then there is “Management Comps” which can only be used with permission from Laura, Adam, Steffi or Cindy, and will be used when we give away a room for promotional, trade or donation purposes. If you are ever called upon to make a reservation using this code, please always include who asked you to comp the room in the comments section.\r\n\r\n    I know the phones are starting to ramp up and spring is in the air. Please let me know if there are any marketing tools that you think might help you turn as many of those calls as possible into bookings. This time of year it’s all about converting interest in bookings, so if you routinely find that something keeps people from going ahead with a reservation, please, please, please make sure I know about it. Use our discount programs creatively and help callers get exactly what they need to make the reservation work.\r\n\r\n    thanks everyone! We are so lucky to have such a great, dedicated and wonderful staff. I’m really excited about going into this busy season with such a strong team! Have fun…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    the new shades aren’t closing. The current guests are stay-overs. I called Seth, he will look at it tomorrow. Cindy, can you please remind him.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Happy beginning of the work week!\r\n    Please start making keys for the diving group arriving at 4 (invoices not necessary).\r\n    Also: Gio will be training with you Saturday 7.30 to 3.30. I’ll leave her training check-list on my back desk.\r\n\r\n    SAMANTHA FROM GIRL FRIDAY\r\n    Will help us answer our phones again this Spring. She will email us messages. Make those messages a priority please, call guests back right away, etc. Then file her messages in our inbox under “girl friday messages”)\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Will probably open 4/1 with new floors, new paint, new linens, but with the somewhat seasoned furniture.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    We are shooting towards opening Friday 4/18 with an open house on Sunday, 4/27.\r\n\r\n    FIESTA UH LALA FELIX MARGARITA OLE\r\n    That’s right. We will have our Cinco de Mayo, 1 year ELEMENTS anniversary party coming up on Saturday, 5/10.\r\n    This will also be the day where we will all start to wear our uniforms again, always and with no exception: chocolate brown pants and orange shirts (Cindy promised to get us some girl shirts!).\r\n\r\n    Laura brought fancy chocolates for us, check them out. Mhm. I will give the Almonds, Hazelnuts and Pistachios in milk chocolate a good home in my belly.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 8:06 am\r\n\r\n    Puget Sound blood Center:\r\n    There is a note that says they were faxed a CC authorization, did we ever get it back? I didn’t charge anything yet in case. but will charge later this morning after I check with One of the boss ladies and they say its ok.\r\n\r\n    I had one last minute walk-in last night, they read the ferry schedule wrong, two very nice ladies and a baby.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2008 at 2:04 pm\r\n\r\n    wow, so it was a busy day here. need i say more? hmmm but important things to relay…nothing emergent. so have a nice afternoon.\r\n    kj\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2008 at 9:06 am\r\n\r\n    Mopeds and Bikes\r\n    I just spoke with Susie Moped, she is available now for rentals, even if she is not open, she will come down and do a rental. Also, she will be renting out the bikes for Paul at Island Bicycles, if he is closed, she will have bikes at both her Roche Harbor spot and her Friday Harbor spot. First call Island Bicycles and then Susie Moped.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    RANDOM FYI\r\n    - Regino is in 320 for the next 2 nights. I blocked it out.\r\n    - There is a folder on the back desk for Deborah Hopkins. She should come pick it up in the next couple of days.\r\n    - The identifier for the Orca Storage room is ALLSTAFF on the key system. (odd huh?)\r\n    - There is a red and white truck, with a dog in the cab, parked on the access road to the guest house. If it is still there in the morning we may have to make sure it’s moved. We don’t want the co-owner of that road to get displeased. :)\r\n    - Spring must really be here because I got harassed by a bee this afternoon. First one I’ve seen this year.\r\n    - Laters! -\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 7:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Congrats Gio on your first post. Well done. Let’s hope we can get that brown water problem solved…soon!\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn, in answer to your question about the road construction question, and to all of those of you who have no idea what she’s talking about: The Town of Friday Harbor will be replacing a significant part of their sewer system over the next 18 months. They plan on starting up by the sewage treatment plant (on Tucker). They don’t plan on coming into the core of town until next winter, at which point there will be construction on First street in front of Bird Rock. We shouldn’t have anything to be concerned about until then (keep your fingers crossed). When they do start construction, it should be manageable (I’ve talked with them at length about this.)\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 1:57 pm\r\n\r\n    hi there. phones were kinda slow. but people in and out and some e-mail reservations. i am getting my big bird rock guest taken care of…slowly. details details. lots of inquiries for our “new” property opening up…i just want to know when the road construction will start. i just found out about our commission sheet. hooray for the poor folks out there. how creepy for and brave of elena to confront the intruders. more guts than me. i would have called the po po.\r\n\r\n    take care of yourselves out there in the sun. block it.\r\n    by the way…the play is going swimmingly. and becoming more and more fun to be a part of.\r\n\r\n    KJ\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello-\r\n    My first blog!!!! So about our rooms ( Building B )Were looked at today by Rob the plumber, and Jack from west mechanical. Our thermostat was set way toooo HOT 195 F. West M. turned that down, and that may have been the reasoning behind the rusty water?? So Regino is going to flush the hot water tanks today, and hopefully we will be on to new clear water. Yeah :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 11:07 am\r\n\r\n    LAURA SAYS\r\n    If people call for the WA State Scenic Byways conference on April 30, please give them the rate of $89 and a Sky or Earth place.\r\n\r\n    CINDY SAYS\r\n    When processing a reservation, you need to make sure the credit card is valid. Process it while you have the guest on the phone. Don’t ever send a confirmation without processing the credit card first. And please take down the phone number of the guest, so you can at least try to reach them if something goes wrong.\r\n    I will cancel the 2 reservation for Bird Rock with above problems today.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    ADAM SAYS:\r\n    Shoulder season room rates are higher Friday & Saturday night, not only Saturday night.\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock will have split rates from May 1-22, with Fri/Sa being higher than weekdays, and summer rates every day starting May 23.\r\n\r\n    Just so we all know.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Building B\r\n    I have called and left a message for Rob to come and check the brown water issue. I have also reminded him to fix the pump in the laundry room that is leaking.\r\n    AAA\r\n    Our official agreement with AAA has expired (our choice), so we will no longer be advertising, or posting anything to do with AAA. Laura says we can still offer a AAA rate though.\r\n    Elena\r\n    Wow you are a BRAVE women. Was your curling iron HOT??\r\n    Where was Edgar?\r\n    New carpet is being installed in the upstairs of building D, I am hoping to have that building open by April 1, 2008. I will keep you all updated.\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    We will be getting new brochures for Bird Rock, we are just not sure by when. Hopefully we will have updated pictures on the website by the end of April.\r\n    Pool\r\n    Insulation should be put in today, sheeting rocking should be right behind that. Just an FYI, we do have a lock on the door above the ladies bathroom, that is the room with some computer equipment in it. The key is in the office.\r\n    Thats it for now..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Quiet tonight. Morgan set all the guest room clocks ahead.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 10:44 am\r\n\r\n    BUILDING B *Update*\r\n    I asked Regino to run the water in the other rooms to see what is going on. He seems to think that it may only happen when you are running the hot water. Maybe we need to flush out the Hot Water tank or the storage tank? I am not a plumbing expert so… I’m not sure.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    BUILDING B\r\n    We have been getting some reports from guests over the past couple weeks that they are having intermittent to full-on “rusty-colored water” coming out of their faucets and spigots. Sometimes it only does it for a minute or two and then sometimes it won’t go away. We move folks to a new room and come back the next day and it’s running clear. It’s really strange. Is the town flushing their system again or do we need to call Rob?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    RATES & RATES\r\n    Please read Adam’s email about rate changes. Morgan updated the rate sheets already.\r\n\r\n    Also: when making a booking in WRP and you don’t see as an option BEST RATE AVAILABLE or AAA/AARP or a current special, just others (like ELDERHOSTEL), then we are sold out. All rooms still available are already allocated. Let me show you an example the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    FIRST FLIGHT\r\n    Is a promotion for making reservations at Bird Rock between now and 3/31/08. If a guests refers to or requests the FIRST FLIGHT special, write in their reservation that we will put a complimentary split of champagne in their room when they arrive. Also create an alarm for their arrival date, reminding us to put the champagne in their room.\r\n\r\n    NIGHT MANAGER OF THE MONTH\r\n    Goes to Elena! A construction worker from Bird Rock came up to ELEMENTS last night, telling Gio and I that he will be the last one out and doesn’t have a key. When we had all our check-ins in, we went down there, with our rate sheet and I showed Gio around. When we were in the Lopez we heard foot steps. Then Elena appeared in the door, complete with iron rod in her hand, ready to bash in the intruders heads. We all burst out laughing. Ladies & gentlemen, there is a woman doing her job!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 7th, 2008 at 9:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder–bet it’s going around–set the clocks forward Saturday night before closing. In fact, maybe we should put it on the housekeeping sheet to set clocks forward as they clean Saturday???\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend……..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 6th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Morgan,\r\n    would you be a Sweetheart and answer Bird Rock’s email inquiries this morning, please?\r\n    We also need to print more gift certificates. Can you print some if Cindy isn’t too busy?\r\n    See you at 3.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 6th, 2008 at 9:04 pm\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Please know that room 107 still doesn’t have a functioning lock. Gio and I blocked it out until 3/14. Please remind Seth to check that out.\r\n\r\n    NEW BOOKINGS\r\n    Guys, check that new bookings section. There were online reservation from several days in there, what up?\r\n\r\n    ADD ONS\r\n    When a guest selects add-ons when making an online reservation (whale watch, etc.), WRP calculates the price according for how many guests a room was rented for, just to give the guest an idea of the cost. Then, when we process the reservation the charges revert to zero. ERGO: when you book a massage, whale watch or kayak tour, you need to add the applicable charges to the room manually.\r\n\r\n    Laura, you have done what I was not able to in 14 years: you found a chocolate Daniel likes: the hickory smoked almonds with sea salt and milk chocolate you brought us from Las Vegas. Wow. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2008 at 7:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan,\r\n    I didn’t flush while you were in the shower today…I was so proud of myself that I remembered!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2008 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi friends,\r\n    I just to remind you all that when you take a reservation for a PET room, please try to get the PET NAME so that we can put it in our cute little welcome PET letter.\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 4th, 2008 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there. Pretty slow on the phones today. I did take some more early arrivals for the kayaking Elderhostel coming up this spring. We have started a folder on the back desk for early arrivals so that we can keep them in the same room. So when the group gets created on the system…just double check to make sure the guest can stay in the same room for their whole stay. Some of those rooms have been locked. When making a new early arrival…print out the face sheet and put it in the folder.\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    I did an update on the Big Bird Rock package we have going on. Waiting on Brian G. from Outfitters to get back to me about the kayak tour. I placed it in your box again.\r\n\r\n    All else good. See you tomorrow.\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi from ELEMENTS Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Tea is ordered. We need small dog bones for our guest dogs. If somebody goes shopping, buy some bulk for us, would you?\r\n\r\n    I talked to Capt. Maya today, he’ll raise his prices this summer to $75 per person. Make sure you let guests know that and adjust the price accordingly in WRP when booking with Maya.\r\n\r\n    San Juan Safari dropped off price & activity sheet for this summer. They’ll start April 5 and will only offer whale watch cruises out of FH and chartered boat trips.\r\n\r\n    San Juan Outfitters (who bought the kayaking operation from SJS) will offer kayaking from FH and RH and whale watch cruises from RH.\r\n\r\n    TGIM (thanks God it’s Monday). I’ll see you all in a couple of days.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 5:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Elena, what research. I can’t wait for March 16th. I mean who doesn’t love hiccups?\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    We need to order an assortment Tazo teas for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    The floor plan is done for the wind place.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    301 & 302 both had very brown water today so the folks that were set to check-in for the building have been moved to 107& 108.\r\n\r\n    The porthole group that will be coming in March 14-16th will need a pick-up at the ferry around 3-4pm they will call up but I set an alarm for that day anyways, just as a reminder.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning all! Yes! It is March only 17 days to spring, tulips are peaking through the ground, bunny day is just around the corner (did you hide your eggs yet?, and of course St Patrick’s day. But don’t forget to celebrate these other little known, skipped over, forgotten days of March.\r\n\r\n    March 6: Dentist Day & Frozen Food Day.\r\n    March 8: Daylight savings begins! International Women’s day.\r\n    March 9: Cabin fever day (get you some cabin fever!)\r\n    March 10: National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\r\n    March 11: Organize your home office day!\r\n    March 12: Girl Scout’s Birthday! Load up on girl scout cookies\r\n    March 14: Potato chip day & Save a spider day\r\n    March 16: hiccup day\r\n    March 19: Chocolate caramel day (just for you steffi)\r\n    March 20: Barbie Doll Day, First day of Spring\r\n    March 22: Goof off day!\r\n    March 23: Easter Sunday\r\n    March 24: Chocolate covered raisins day\r\n    March 27: fly a kite day (Hope there is enough wind, kites are no fun on the ground)\r\n    March 28: Something on a stick Day (hhhhmmmmm)\r\n    March 30: Doctor’s Day!\r\n\r\n    So Celebrate march\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m so glad we have Tory and Khaili on board, you guys ROCK! Khaili processed online reservations tonight like she never did anything else in her entire life.\r\n\r\n    Please, everybody, check Bird Rock’s WRP daily, we are getting lot’s and lot’s of reservations (don’t forget to print them out for somebody else to double check).\r\n\r\n    Western Prince called today to let us know that they will start their wild life cruises on 3/29 this year ($69 for adults, $49 for kids). They will go out any day they get 8 customers together (at noon), just to let you all know.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, Capt. Maya called back, but I couldn’t find the reservation in question. He will call you Tuesday night.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Elena, for covering a shift tomorrow morning on such short notice, you are a gem.\r\n\r\n    STEPS menus are in the rooms, except 311 & 322.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2008 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    I have now completed my second shift with Steffi. I think I am getting the hang of things, now. Well, hope you all have a great week :) See you next Sunday\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2008 at 11:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    My first all nighter with Steffi!! I really feel like part of the family now. Steffi and I decided that when double checking the online reservations we should circle the entire booking option if there are no inquiries, and highlight only those which call for our attention. That way nothing slips through the cracks. Learned all about Room Service tonight and Steps new menu! Room 302 moved to 324 due to the rusty water issue. Morgan please remind housekeeping that 302 needs to be cleaned.Thanks T!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2008 at 8:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome to the team, Gio!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETINGS\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock all staff (Elena, Tory, Kaitlyn & HK) on Thursday 3/27, noon, at Bird Rock if possible.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS Front Desk (all of us, even those who will migrate down the street) on Sunday, 3/30, 2 PM\r\n\r\n    These meetings are mandatory, please be there.\r\n\r\n    ONLINE RESERVATIONS/UNIREZ RESERVATIONS\r\n    As of today, please print a hard copy of each incoming online reservation and UNIREZ reservation. Process the reservation in WRP as usual, highlight the possible add-ons (massage, whale watch, etc.) & initial the hard copy and put in basket by back desk.\r\n    Then double check reservations (other people made), initial again and file in file cabinet under my printer (like we used to with Inntopia & webervation).\r\n    I hope by having 2 sets of eyes on each reservation we won’t miss add-ons.\r\n\r\n    Gio started training today. Welcome to the team!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 3:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday….\r\n    Pool roof is looking GOOD, amazing enough (JK) the wood is rotting around the windows on the ceiling. J I am going to see if Jared will come and fix it. Then the roofers will be back to put the flashing on.\r\n    Let’s start to put out the bikes when it is nice. Can someone wipe them down, and check the tires, handle bars etc. this weekend?\r\n    #310 is out of service, we are trying to fix the table in there with the scratches on it, if we absolutley need that room, just make sure we change out the table in there in the mean time. If you don’t need it, it is marked out until Tuesday.\r\n    Have a good weekend.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n\r\n    I’m back from Vegas. No, I didn’t win lots o’ money, but then I didn’t gamble, so…\r\n\r\n    Spring is in the air and the phones are ringing, so everyone remember to keep that smile on your face and in your voice, even in the face of chaos and adversity. Just remember that you ROCK!\r\n\r\n    Oh, and by the way, just like Steffi said NO DOWNLOADING!! This is VERY important. Even the smallest thing, like downloading a screen saver can wreak havoc and cost us lots of money. Thank you for respecting this.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2008 at 7:24 pm\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Door doesn’t open. I blocked it out until Seth is back. The lock blinks green, but pressing the handle doesn’t disengage the lock, seems to be a mechanical problem.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Please remember to let everybody know about the pool closure. I went through upcoming reservations and found several who didn’t know.\r\n\r\n    STEPS\r\n    Has a new menu out. I’ll replace them on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    CHECKING OUT GUESTS\r\n    Don’t forget to check out guests in WRP after 3 PM.\r\n\r\n    KAITLYN\r\n    Great job on Bird Rock reservation #1039804. I’ll leave it up to you to follow up on all the add-ons. Keep me posted.\r\n\r\n    UNIQUE EXPERIENCE\r\n    I had the dubious pleasure to remove a tick from my dog’s manhood yesterday. That is something I don’t do every day!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2008 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Flowers were ordered for the wrong date for room 325, Cindy knows and has settled with Robin they will be re-delivered tomorrow, I will drop the vase they came in off at robin’s to be reused.\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    February 27th, 2008 at 3:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey there. Today I learned a lot…again. We have a reservation for Bird Rock Hotel coming up in May. I printed out an information sheet on it and put it in Steffi’s box. (cause I don’t have one up here) Sorry Steffi. You can place elsewhere if you can’t stand the smell of it. he he he Reservation number 1039804. If anyone has any questions you can ask me. There is another reservation inquiry in Steffi’s box for a group of people in June to stay at Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    I found it really handy to have blank paper next to my station when answering phone and doing odd tasks. My head is spinning. Otherwise a good day. The roof for the pool is coming down. HoooHA!\r\n\r\n    see you next week!\r\n    Kaitlyn\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 26th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    MINI-ROMANCE PACKAGE\r\n    Please call the florists in the morning to arrange our usual bouquet for reservation #1039605. They have also ordered some champagne so please make sure we set aside a bottle for them.\r\n    NOISE COMPLAINTS\r\n    Some guests in Building “A” complained about some of the construction guys staying here. I went up and had a talk with them. They were hanging out in the parking lot drinking. I haven’t heard anything from anybody after the talking to. Guest #1035301 was the person who called me. She may want to talk to someone in the morning but I doubt it.\r\n    REGINO\r\n    I didn’t mark it out because it is already shut down during the roofing but, Regino will be in 307 for the next 2 nights.\r\n    CONFERENCE ROOM\r\n    I couldn’t find my camera’s cable today so I will email y’all a picture or two of the conference room tomorrow. That way we can send it off to the folks who are interested in using it for a wedding.\r\n    Well that’s about it. I’m gonna go sleep my weekend away and try to get rid of this dang cold. Laters!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 26th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n    Pool Roof, Wednesday is the day Savage is starting to reroof the pool building. I have blocked out 301-307, 314, 320,321, 322, 326, 327 for Wed, Thurs, Fri, I don’t want the guests to be disturb by the noise, on Friday I will find out what day the workers will be back and make adjustments for the upcoming week.\r\n    Centurytel is working on our voice mail problem, The are also checking into why Girl Friday is not getting our overflow calls.\r\n    Priscilla, Alex and Chad need a decorator, can you please assist them in their new apartment:) (don’t tell them I said anything) HAHA\r\n    Please remember to tell people that are making reservations that we are putting a new roof on the pool, suggest to everyone that the back building A is the best choice for noise level. If they don’t mind book them in any other room. Please honor the water room price in a earth room until the roof is complete. We are still looking at the end of March for the pool to reopen.\r\n    Thanks for all your attention, remember not to do school work at work.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    NO DOWNLOADING\r\n    Guys, please don’t download games, screen savers, etc. As I said before, we make our living on-line, so let’s not endanger that by catching a virus (somebody is using my email account to spam from, right now, I get about 50 emails a minutes, not funny, I called Chris).\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Please work on the floor plans for the Wind Place and the Hideaway as soon as you can, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 24th, 2008 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please read email in in-box regarding a picture of the conference center. Can you take a picture and send it to them, please?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    All future arrivals through March have been informed of the pool being under construction.\r\n\r\n    SPPP\r\n    (Steffi’s personal perfume problem). Just a reminder: we are entering the time of the year were we are many people in the office again and it’s not warm enough to leave the doors open yet. Please remember that I have real issues (nausea, headaches, nosebleeds, ears ringing, can’t concentrate) with too much perfume & hairspray. Please consider me when getting ready for work and please don’t use perfume or hairspray in the office or our bathroom. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 22nd, 2008 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Check it out, our website is up: http://www.birdrockhotel.com. The phones are ringing off the hooks, very cool. So remember, the 5800 number is most likely somebody inquiring for Bird Rock, answer accordingly.\r\n\r\n    AIR CONDITION\r\n    I called the guest with the air condition question, Priscilla. Just a reminder, all rooms in building B & D have air condition.\r\n\r\n    EMAIL\r\n    Girls, please don’t forget to deal with the front desk emails on my computer during your shifts. File the confirmation letters & online reservations (after you processed them), answer the questions people have & always sign your name, forward emails you don’t know what to do with (complaints, group inquiries) to Cindy & I or leave in the in-box if there is no time pressure on the questions.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    will be off island Saturday & Sunday, so we are on our own in case of emergencies.\r\n    FH Freight came, all is in the Beaverton Valley facility (#29), which is full now. Ben & Seth dealt with the plumbing shipment, it’s all in the Roche Harbor facility.\r\n\r\n    What a gorgeous day! When I woke up this morning Mr. Esspike had his bikini on and a drink with an umbrella in his paw, laying on the porch.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 21st, 2008 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    **********\r\n    The woman in rm 325 (who brought her pet rats) is staying for the second night tonight but has yet to pay due to some money issues(basically she is overdrawn in her account). Her husband is depositing money tonight and so she has been assured by her bank that the money will show in her account by tomorrow. I was able to cancel her 60-min side-by-side massage without charge(pheeww!) I have a copy of her credit card.\r\n    This morning she mis dialed 911 twice, one of the deputies came by and went to check on her.\r\n    She also showed me pictures of her rats (by the elements logo) because she intends to e-mail them to us later in case we want to use them on our website for our pet-friendly page.\r\n\r\n    *****Big Delivery*****\r\n    if all goes well we will get a delivery of about 18 couches, chairs, sofas etc from Friday Harbor Freight will deliver them and Seth knows, so call him when they get here.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2008 at 10:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Shift went well, the stuffed raccoon made its way onto the bed for our arriving guests. their room still needs to be charged, the woman maxed out her daily spending limit today so it was declined. They are here for a few days and Steffi okayed it.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN Don’t worry about the radio anymore, Techie Chris and Steffi already fixed it.\r\n\r\n    Question: Are rooms 341, 338, and 336 all air conditioned??? Just double checking for a guest #1028844 who called back to make sure. i told them i would check and confirm in a brief email back.\r\n\r\n    FOR RAQUEL Have you found a cell phone? Perhaps and silver verizon wireless Envy (they have the full keyboard) if so, contact Chad Hesman, i put a phone number on a sticky note near the whiteboard.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN Thanks for the keychain from Vegas…its totally awesome, I love it!!\r\n\r\n    If Adam’s back I would like to pass along a “welcome home” and that i heard Jack Johnson has a new CD, maybe a possibility for an updated Summer playlist..hint hint ;)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    GLITCH IN THE MATRIX\r\n    O.K. guys, this is very important: NOBODY is going to refund any guests until further notice.\r\n\r\n    There is something wrong with WRP, I’m waiting for them to call me back. Elena refunded a guest (#1025567) and it all looks correct on paper and on screen, but when you actually go through the settled transactions, it was a charge, not a refund. So the poor man, who had a mediocre time to say the least, was then charged twice for a couple’s massage he never received. If you need to refund, refer to me, I’ll be back Friday after 3PM.\r\n    I am ready for my weekend.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    POOL POOL POOL POOL\r\n    Guests arriving after 2/20/08 have not been promised health club coupons (exceptions: see guest remarks). We have to fade them out, can’t afford it. So for now, don’t push them on people, give out if they ask only.\r\n    And please please please don’t forget to mention to every new reservation (not only phone reservations, online reservations as well) that the pool house is out of order (definitely until 3/15/08, give warning to guest arriving in late March).\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you play around with the receiver and the I-tunes, I can’t get the music to play. Let the music play…\r\n    We haven’t heard anything from the Ipod radio people, can you follow up on that, please?\r\n    We are expecting a large shipment from FH Freight, please call Seth upon arrival.\r\n    Please work on the pool trouble shooting list (just kidding, ha, ha!).\r\n    Good to have you back, see you Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2008 at 8:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Laura asks if you could please create floor plans of the Hideaway & the Wind Place by Thursday (hideaway keys in my lower file cabinet, call Dave to make sure it’s not rented) and then call her. As soon as that’s done, we can get the new website up, yeah! Her Oregon number is on the board above my computer.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL\r\n    is off Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday. Please call Regino for HK. If he is not on the property, Olga will have R’s phone.\r\n\r\n    ME ME ME\r\n    I’ll take my weekend Wednesday & Thursday. Call me at home for front desk issues.\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY\r\n    Please remind Seth and/or Regino to take the seats out of the van, so Ben can take it off-island to get things for Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY\r\n    When Ben comes back Thursday night, please park and lock van, it will be unloaded Friday morning.\r\n\r\n    SUSHI\r\n    made it! He is so easy to talk to. He ate well, every other day. We became really close. Mr. Esspike is a little jealous.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Morgan & Adam, we missed you. Tell us travel stories!\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2008 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    could you double check the rate on the folks in the wind place from this weekend 2-18. They said they had an adjustment due to road noise. Not sure who they spoke to about this. Could you send them and e-mail letting them know that we adjusted their rate? Or show me how?\r\n\r\n    By the way…learning lots on the new system. Crazy time!!\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Was Johnny Depp on the spot this morning with the bikes, thank you so much. Only #1 & #7 are still out of order.\r\n\r\n    LA MUSICA\r\n    Donde estas? I can’t get the receiver in my office to work, is it me? Elena & Kaitlyn, maybe you can sing for our guests tomorrow morning?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    If any of the future reservations I called want to cancel or reschedule, please let them without penalty.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2008 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL REQUEST:\r\n    Steffi, lovely can you put a bottle of champagne in room 217 this evening at 8:00PM or before Tori leaves? A card that goes with the champagne is already made and the champagne is chilling.\r\n\r\n    SPA APP.\r\n    Steffi the spa returned your call about the massage appointment for John Pearce. They have 2 appointments available at 9:00am and one at 10:30am.\r\n\r\n    UH OH!\r\n    A guy came in today and said that we should look at blocking off the drop off by the guest laundry, which is directly behind some of the parking spots of the Sky places. Apparently he went down it and scratched up the side of his car pretty bad. He asked that I pass this along.\r\n\r\n    LETTER ON BACK DESK:\r\n    Raquel had me write out a letter for Rosa Garcia- Soto (one of the housekeepers). The letter basically says that she is fired and explains the reason, She needs to sign one of the copies, she can keep one and the signed one is for Cindy to file away.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 9:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentleman,\r\n    we have one rentable room left for the night and I keep getting phone inquiries.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please make sure to print the entire HK report tomorrow, not some short version (pets, early departures, etc.)\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please find a list of rentable bikes (#8, #3, #2) on the back desk, use the list to keep track (don’t forget to have everybody sign a release form). I called Seth and asked him to stop by early and pump up the low air ones and break the locks of the bikes we can’t open. Rent them without locks unless somebody really wants one (there are three functioning ones by the helmets). Please ask Raquel if she knows where the air pumps went.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONs\r\n    We had several reservations today, who had added massages online and nobody followed up on it. Whenever you process a reservation, make sure you read through the list of add-ons, check the pricing, WRP adds the prices of add-ons to the room. When you have a second, go through the check-ins of the following days and see if everything necessary had been done. For example #1029276, check-in for tomorrow, selected: Massage: not sure, call me. So please call him in the morning.\r\n\r\n    COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION\r\n    #1024482 had come in earlier to inform us that he has sawdust in the bedroom and a clogged toilet. He was promised an i-pod radio for white noise. None of this had been followed up on. Keep a list, it’s that time of the year. Just a reminder: only the Sky Places have i-pod radios.\r\n\r\n    KAYAK TOURS\r\n    Discovery Sea kayak does tours all year around. Sunset tours, 3-4 hours, $79 per person, kids must be 13 or older.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    I’ll start calling future reservations about the pool closure tomorrow. I want everybody to please write in the guest remarks that a guest has been informed about the closure, when making a new reservation. The health club will be open 11 AM to 4 PM tomorrow and 6 AM to 8 PM Mo-Fri.\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY AFTERNOON FROM CINDY\r\n    Ben (my nephew) will be coming off of the ferry on Sunday afternoon with a load of plumbing stuff for the Bird Rock. When he calls please call Seth and let him know what time Ben will meet Seth at the Roche Harbor storage unit. Seth will have the keys to the unit. Ben may need directions on where it is, please ask Seth. Thanks, Cindy\r\n\r\n    Girls & Tory, you ROCK. Thank you so much for all your hard work. Be kind, keeps lists & multi-task away. See you at 2.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh! if Savage Roofing sends in a fax…give it to Seth for him to look over and have him call Cindy. Thank you!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW!\r\n\r\n    almost felt like summer today, walked in at 12:30 and Elena had already had two rushes. Rest of the day went fairly smoothly, other than some misplaced spa appointments. It really is time to get organized and prepare for the season.\r\n\r\n    This morning Red Cross brought in a guest whose home was flooded last night. We put the bill in Cindy’s box to take care of.\r\n\r\n    Tori came into train more…yay!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Can you please print out more Health Club vouchers, we’ll need them.\r\n    Thank you. See you at 3.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 8:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, is it summer? 33 check-ins tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Change in plans: Priscilla will show up at 12.30 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Read the notes of #1026289 and let HK know if they bring a pet.\r\n\r\n    EMERALD GLASS\r\n    Type Emerald Glass in the search field of WRP and read notes on the existing 3 reservations. The owner was upset because one of us told her she had a direct bill account. Please remember that Cindy and only Cindy decides who has a direct bill account. Refer guests wishing for a direct bill arrangement to her.\r\n    Then she called yesterday and added 3 people to the list of people who can make reservations for the company and that information was not recorded anywhere. So, below find instructions on how to make reservations for them and please be consistent and informed, the next time somebody from the company calls.\r\n    When one of the four people authorized to make reservations for Emerald Glass calls: write “Emerald Glass” into the search window in WRP. Click on one of the old reservations, hit the “copy” button (this will transfer not only the contact info, but also the guests remarks and the credit card info), then proceed to make a reservation for the dates and number of rooms requested. Please ask for the worker’s names (write them into the “additional guest” area), charge 10% write email and put remainder on card on file upon arrival. Does this makes sense to everybody? As always, ask me, when you see me.\r\n\r\n    I hired Sheryl today, she will start training on 2/28 and will be part time. Welcome Sheryl! We almost got our crew together for this season, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, for Johnny Depp! Oh man, look at those cheek bones, miau.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    So much news. Are you all taking all of this in? If not, don’t be shy, ask lots of questions, and re-read it until you understand it.\r\n\r\n    Next week, we will be getting two furniture shipments in for Bird Rock. Whoever is working the front desk, please contact Seth to coordinate where to deliver the products. If you have any questions, you can try to contact me on my cell, but I will be in Central Oregon and may be out of cell range. You can always email me, though. I check that often.\r\n\r\n    Happy mid-winter break!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool\r\n    The pool will be out of commission for at least another 2-3 weeks. The roof has to be replaced before we can forward with the sheet rock and the painting. Dave Payne will be starting the roof on Monday 2-18, I will remind him to not start earlier than 9am, and let’s try and not have anyone in 301-307 for the first week, or at least let’s tell the guests what to expect prior to them arriving. Make sure all upcoming reservation from the 18th thru March 3 know about the delay in the pool.\r\n    Onity (key lock system)\r\n    Gary and his crew finished doing a once over, through all the locks on the property, all of them have been fixed except for a couple that we are going to have to wait until replacements come for them.\r\n    Windplace: Has a defective lock on the front door of the house and the lock going out to the front porch from the bedroom. A new lock has been ordered\r\n    Room #117: Lock is defective and I have blocked out that room until we receive the new lock\r\n    312/314: Need some fixing but, they are still working now. They have also had new locks ordered.\r\n    Wednesday Feb 20, 2008\r\n    Ben Krieg, my nephew is going to pick up the keys for the van, and he is going to take it to Bellingham (per Laura) to pick up the reset of the plumbing fixtures for Bird Rock. Could you please have Seth or Regino take out as many seats as possible. He will return on Thursday, and will need to have someone deliver all of the product out of the van into one of the storage units.\r\n    Have a great week. Thanks for holding down the fort while I am gone.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 11:58 am\r\n\r\n    GREETINGS\r\n    Hello from sunny, cold, and windy Las Vegas! Rache ad I have been traveling all over the place ans seeing as much as possible. Being outside isn’t much fun. Las Vegas is having the worse winds in over 10 years. It was gusting to almost 70mph the other night. Stuff was being blown around and you will see in one of my photos, part of the Paris Hotel balloon was blown off. Speaking of photos. I may not have them up until I get back. The Stratosphere has the worse internet system I have ever had in a hotel. Not only did they charge an arm and a leg to have it. The speeds are like being on dial-up again. I am sooo glad our internet at ELEMENTS is free ad speedy. Honestly, you’d think a near billion dollar hotel could have decent internet. Let’s hear it for us little guys. I am going to keep trying to post but at least I got a pic of Johnny Depp up for Steffi. Talk to you all soon. Remember, email me if you want anything special from Sin City. LATERS!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2008 at 9:22 pm\r\n\r\n    THIS WEEKEND\r\n    We will be busy. Kaitlyn & Priscilla will be our back-up girls as follows:\r\n    Kaitlyn will stay until after the 3.35 ferry tomorrow, Priscilla will arrive before 5.00 and stick it out for the next two ferries with me.\r\n    On Saturday Kaitlyn will help Elena from 12.30 to 4.30, Priscilla will be on call for me. On Sunday and Monday Kaitlyn will help Elena from 9 to 1. Thank you, guys.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Both the FHI & the Bird Rock website, which should be up by next week, don’t say anymore that we are still remodeling. We are shooting for 4/1/08 for opening. Please refer guests to ELEMENTS until then. Also: The Orca & the San Juan suite will have aireated tubs as opposed to jetted tubs, after the remodel. Laura will change the rate sheet to reflect this change soon.\r\n\r\n    NEW BOOKINGS SECTION\r\n    Please check the “New Bookings” section frequently, so you don’t miss alarms or don’t forget to process reservations. There were a bunch of reservations today, some processed but not email confirmed and still marked “new”, some not processed at all. Tis that time of the year: keep a list for the day, so you finish projects during which you got interrupted, communicate rather more than less, check and reply to emails, check phone messages and the “new bookings” section feverishly every time you have a second. Please don’t drop the ball.\r\n\r\n    BOOM TIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    We got a couple of online gift certificates today. One, 5004, couldn’t be processed because the credit card was declined. It’s still in in-box, reservation in WRP is made (#5004), left msg with purchaser, just needs to be paid.\r\n    Reminder: once a boom time gift certificate comes in the email: click on boom time, sign in (password saved), click on the credit card icon next to the purchaser’s name and transfer the credit card info into a new reservation in WRP (kind of like we used to with Innoptias). In WRP change room status to “Gift certificate only”, use boom time gift cert. number as confirmation number, write in guest remarks: boom time gift cert., purchaser’s name and amount, make it out to “A Special Guest”.\r\n    Change room price to gift cert. amount (tax exempt amount)and charge card.\r\n    Then confirm purchase with boom time and write the gift certificate in our hard copy folder under the front desk.\r\n    Got that? This is one I want to show you. Please remind me the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    NEW\r\n    We hired Gia & Khaili today. Khaily will start to train 2/24 and will work Sunday morning back ups until school is out. Gia will start training 2/29 and will be full time once she is trained. Welcome aboard!\r\n\r\n    Happy VD everyone, thanks for all the love, Priscilla and all the candy, Cindy:)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 13th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    ♥ First, to say Happy St. VALENTINES’s day!! ♥\r\n\r\n    Busy weekend coming up with all the love birds.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for the schedule change Steffi, but if anyone can cover my shifts on the 7th and 9th that would be wonderful. I was invited to a conference over the weekend in Bellingham. If thats not possible, please let me know asap. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    Cindy, have fun in Big White, don’t let those boys have tooooo much fun ;) I’m sure they will behave for you.\r\n\r\n    Steffi, you always know about the most interesting stuff..winter breaks coming up and i could use a good book to snuggle up and read. oh and…the phone call to the dentist is in progress…yikes!!\r\n\r\n    MoMo, I can’t wait to see pics of Vegas, last time i was there i woke up in the back of my moms car in a gas station on the way to my uncles wedding in cali. Definitely not as much fun as you are having.\r\n\r\n    PS. Onity guys are here, and if Cindy’s not at work today remind Seth to take the van to the Lubeguy for an 11:00 appointment.\r\n\r\n    peace.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2008 at 12:37 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Howdy all! I just wanted to let you all know that I will be working on the pool as soon as I can get in there when I get back. Until then please tell everybody not to turn on the pool filter pumps while I am gone. If someone absolutely\r\n    has to, please make sure they put a couple of inches of water in the pool first. I have added a bunch of chemicals to the pool to try and stave off any major growth during my absence. I hope to only take about 3 days getting the pool up and going once I get in there. I plan on emptying almost all the water out and scrubbing the heck out of the bottom before refilling it and balancing the chemicals. I am going to leave a list of items I will need from Gerard. Can someone please make sure anything they deliver gets put by the pile of chemical buckets in the pool house? Thanks.\r\n\r\n    iPOD RADIOS\r\n    If someone from iHome calls for me about the iPod docks, send them to Laura or Cindy. All in all, we need 320 & 308’s radio repaired/replaced (item # iH4B). We also need to order a couple of spare power supply cables (item # iAD25B). Laura also wants 5 of the larger radios for Fridays (item # iH9BR). 320’s radio is in the office, 308’s is still in the room. 309 needs a power supply cable.\r\n\r\n    FEDEX\r\n    We just got a delivery of a whole bunch of FedEx shipping supplies. We now have a nice assortment of padded envelopes, soft tyvek envelopes, and cardboard envelopes. We also have a stack of shipping forms and the self-stick clear plastic sleeves they go in. This bounty of shipping delights can be found on the floor in Steffi’s office underneath the shelves. ( Or at least until she gets tired of it being there and finds a better spot)\r\n\r\n    SUSHI\r\n    I will be leaving my Betta in the office with Steffi while I am gone. He only needs to be fed a little bit every other day. If he is hungry he will usually get all excited by someone walking near his bowl.\r\n\r\n    OTHER\r\n    Keep an eye on my Flickr site (click on my name above this post). I hope to try and update it if I take any cool photos whilst in Vegas. Someone please break then news to Seth that I am sorry and I will not be going into any strip clubs and I doubt they would let me take a camera in there anyway. I will be back to work on the 20th so everybody take it easy. email/call me if there is anything you would like me to get for you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 10th, 2008 at 8:36 pm\r\n\r\n    I POD RADIOS\r\n    Morgan did an inventory and contacted the applicable repair company. What you’ll need to know: 320 & 308 don’t have functioning Ipod radios right now and 309’s power cable is missing.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    Just a reminder: whenever HK finds something in a guest room, they’ll attach a lost & found form to that day’s HK report. For example today some toys were found in 309. So when a guest calls to inquire about a lost item, go through the HK report of her check out date first, if there is no note attached, call Raquel anyway and don’t forget to follow up with the guest.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S BOOK TIP\r\n    “Spook Country” by William Gibson. You know Gibson from “Neuromancer” and “Jonny Memnonic”. Gibson, who lives on Vancouver Island, seized to write Science Fiction, it’s not necessary anymore, he says. Every technology described in his newest book is not only possible but in use right now, scary. The book is about Hollis, a former rock star, who now tries to make her living by writing. She is on assignment to write about a new art form, utilizing GPS devices and certain helmets. One goes to a place, in this case the Viper Room in L.A., puts on this helmet and sees River Phoenix laying dead in the streets. But why does the guy making this possible, technologically, not want to be interviewed, and what’s with the Cuban Russians and their I-pods, and why does this cop, Brown, hold a Russian speaking drug addict prisoner…?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 9th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    The new schedule is up.\r\n    Please look everybody, slight changes for all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 8th, 2008 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPS GROUPS GROUPS\r\n    Cindy printed out all group names for 2008 (above my computer, please always put back). So when somebody calls, saying he is part of a group, grab the file real quick and see if we have an arrangement with that group, look it up in WRP by name or go to the group folios and look it up by date. See what the arrangement is and make the reservation for the guest.\r\n\r\n    VMCCA\r\n    For example will come 9/21/08 and their guests are starting to call in. First, ask the guest if he wants to stay one or two nights (the group reservations are for one night, but a guest may tag on another night for the same rate), then ask what type of room he wants. Adjust an existing VMCCA reservation accordingly by going to “c”. Then continue to make a regular reservation, name, cc info, etc, take 10% deposit and send confirmation. I adjusted the room rate to the correct price already. As always, let me show you when we work together, and ask me questions.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Changed their relaxation massages to Swedish massages, their therapeutic massages to Deep Tissue. It’s the same thing, just a name change.\r\n    They also have an open house on Friday, 2/15 from 7-9. Art and 15 min free massages, tell our guests and check it out yourself.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Just a reminder: please don’t forget to let all guests know about our pool situation when they make a reservation for the next couple of weeks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    NO PERSONAL CHECKS\r\n    Just a reminder: we don’t take personal checks (or third party business checks for that matter) as payment, just visa, master, cash and Traveler’s Checks.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Cindy called all upcoming reservations. In some cases she simply asked for a call back, without stating the issue. if you get a call from a guest arriving in the next 2 weeks, please let them know about our pool issues, offer to cancel or move the reservation at no charge, mention the health club if needed. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    IPOD radio in 330\r\n    What’s the situation? Has anybody followed up on this? Who do we call? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Thank you Priscilla for creating alarms on unfinished reservations. One thing: if the reservation is far out, like in May or so, make the alarm for a week before arrival, not for today. If it’s for the next couple of weeks, start to process it: leave message with spa, guest, etc.\r\n\r\n    NAME conference in July\r\n    One of us (no signature on email, please always sign your name) quoted a woman making a reservation for July a 10% discount, because she is part of a conference called NAME. As far as I know we don’t have any such arrangement, Cindy?\r\n    If you are in doubt about a group or a discount, please let the guest know that you aren’t sure, that you will find out and call back. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Who threw out my hot sauce and why?\r\n\r\n    FILM TIP OF THE DAY\r\n    If you need a break from the primaries, watch “V for Vendetta”, la lucha continua!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 4:49 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S. Elena great work with the drawings! I’m going to review them tonight and hopefully we’ll get them uploaded to the new web page soon.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 4:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena (and everyone) just a reminder not to put guest names into this log, just the reservation number. I just changed your recent post to fix this. Thanks!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    981615:\r\n    The water in their tub was running brown so I moved them to 312, since they were a late check-in I charged them this morning on separate reservations since I don’t know how to split a reservation yet by moving only one night. They have two keys so everything is set for them.\r\n\r\n    POOL:\r\n    Cindy called upcoming guests today to let them know about our pool closure remember we still have handy health club passes in the basket next to the card machine.\r\n    Prissy Says:\r\n    February 6th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Hello,\r\n\r\n    Theres a list by the phone that I started. This list is everyone who will be staying with us through feb. 18. Cindy would like us to call these people and say a little “We’re looking forward to your stay, but unexpectedly the pool house is closed and we would like to let you know. To accommodate for this we are offering our guests free vouchers to the private health and fitness club one block away….etc…” if anyone doesn’t want to stay, they will face no punishment. I got to Feb. 12 and then started slopping up my messages. When they have been contacted please put a check next to the reservation so we do not call anyone twice.\r\n\r\n    Anyways, things are good and SENIOR life is starting to get busy…once again finals are up next week and then WINTER BREAK!! yay!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2008 at 3:47 pm\r\n\r\n    WSF\r\n    New info. We now have a master list of all the Washington State Ferry people who are allowed to book rooms for direct bill. Per Cindy, if anyone calls to make a reservation for a ferry worker they must be on that list if they want direct bill. If they are not on that list they must pay for the room themselves and get reimbursed on their own. A copy of the list is posted on the board above Steffi’s desk. Please initial it when you have taken a look. So no more being nice to stranded ferry workers late at night. WSF will refuse to pay for the rooms unless they are booked by someone on the list.\r\n    And now you know. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2008 at 12:04 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL CLOSURE\r\n    O.K. folks. Sorry to say but we are going to close the pool for the remainder of the week. Hopefully it will reopen for the weekend but more than likely we will have to close it again come Monday. The guys from West Mechanical will be fixing/replacing/augmenting the duct work for the dehumidifier and some drywall work will probably need to be done once they are finished. So here is the deal… The pool door will be “Blocked.” We now have “Blocking Cards.” These card disable a lock so that it cannot be used by guests/housekeeping. Cindy has one, the Mechanical guys will have one, and I will have one. To use it slide the blocking card into the lock and remove. The red light should flash. Room keys, pool keys, and master keys should not work now. To get back into the building you must use the block card again and then use your master key. So please, if you are opening shift. Check to make sure that the pool door is locked. Check again when the mechanical guys are done for the day. Just take a pool key with you when you go out to turn off/turn on the outdoor lights. THANKS! We’ll keep you posted on when/if the pool will reopen for the weekend.\r\n    SAN JUAN ISLAND FITNESS CENTER\r\n    We now have some vouchers for the fitness center. They are on the back desk next to the key maker. One voucher per guest, per day. Write the guest’s name on the line and put their reservation # on it somewhere. The pool schedule is one the back of the voucher. The voucher gives them access to the entire facility for a day. It costs us ~$20 per person to use the fitness center so please only hand them out if you “need” to. Try to keep the guests as happy as you can. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n    Mo\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Yikes, we have an event in the conference center tomorrow, noon to 5. I left a message with the guest, let’s see how it goes. Shall we block it out during the garden construction?\r\n\r\n    I fixed the sauna, after Morgan told me how: if the sauna’s “on” button is not responding or the LED’s are blinking, unscrew the casing, press the “program” button, then the up and down arrows to the right time, then hit set. Once the buttons stop blinking, hit the sauna’s “on” button, that did the trick. Morgan, how about that pool trouble shooting list? I made a list of possible issues and put it in your folder on my computer.\r\n\r\n    Reconciled cash, all is good, but: you guys, please drop your cash. When you have cash income, print out the guest invoice, put cash & invoice in an envelope, date and initial the envelope and drop in safe. Then count the cash drawer you have been working out of. This would really make my life easier. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Zoe and Mia\r\n    won so many awards at their swimming competition yesterday, that they forgot one of the awards. A friend dropped it off, it’s on Laura’s desk. You go, girls!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2008 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder, landscaping outside building B starts tomorrow. More of the transformation from parking lot to garden oasis!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 2nd, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS & REQUESTS/REMARKS\r\n    Please read online reservations carefully to make sure you don’t miss a request for massages, whale watch tours, etc.\r\n    Please indicate the status of the request in the “request/remarks” field as in: “wants whale watch on May 2 for 2 ad, fee added, not confirmed, voucher needed, 2/2/08 sw” & create an alarm for several days earlier with the same message, in case somebody forgets to follow up on it, we still catch it a couple of days ahead of arrival.\r\n    If you are the person following up, change the message in the “request/remarks” field according to the progress, as in: has whale watch with Maya’s Charters, 5/2, 1 PM, fee added, voucher needed, 2/3/08 sw.\r\n    Please please don’t forget to change the alarm accordingly.\r\n    And please please make those vouchers, unless the trip is months away and things might change.\r\n    Once everything is done, fee added, confirmed, voucher made, turn the alarm off.\r\n\r\n    TORI\r\n    trained today, went very well. Welcome to the crew, Tori:)\r\n\r\n    Had lot’s of walk-ins today, yeah!\r\n\r\n    I can’t find the front desk cell phone. I hope Morgan didn’t bring it with him to Seattle by accident.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 8:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, the cornstarch cups and garbage bags are here!!\r\n\r\n    Check it out, you guys, our new cups for the coffee station and the garbage bags we will use from now on are all 100% biodegradable (you can throw them in your compost pile) and won’t harm the environment like plastic bags and cups, which take at least 100 years to break down in a landfill (nobody really knows, because we have only used plastic commercially for 90 years and it’s all still there, oh man). Thank you so much, Cindy, for sourcing those.\r\n\r\n    On a similar subject: Valentine’s Day is coming up.\r\n    Flowers are the most toxic & pesticide intensive crops on earth, coming mostly from countries like Colombia, with labor laws poor at best. Plus more than 40% of the world’s conventional (i.e. non-organic, non fair trade) chocolate comes from the Ivory Coast where the State Department and World Labor Organizations have reported wide spread instances of child slavery. So: why not buy your Sweety organic, fair trade chocolate (uhh, soo good) and check out the Organic Consumer Organization for a great list of organic flower companies and other good-for-everybody gift ideas.\r\n\r\n    Aaand, back to work: Morgan, can you check with Raquel tomorrow about cleaning the rooms we had blocked out for the winter in building A? We released the rooms today but it wasn’t clear to me from the HK report which ones are ready to go. Also: can you ask her for some herbal tea for our coffee station? Thank you. Have fun at the game, make us win!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 6:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Regarding things coming in the mail/Fedex/UPS, etc… We will be getting quite a bit of “stuff” over the next few weeks that will eventually be going over to Bird Rock. Please make sure to let ME know when anything comes in so that I can keep track of it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 6:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Thanks every one for the very nice birthday wishes. I was really touched…I know, I know I am a bit touched…in the head already. Anyhow, thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 11:05 am\r\n\r\n    Good Friday Morning :)\r\n    A few things will arrive in a week or so and I want to make sure you all know where they belong. I have ordered a new table for room 312, it will be shipped from Target. I have also ordered new window blinds for the front doors of 312 and 314. Please let me know when these items come in.\r\n    The fans are running in the pool room, which are making a HUGE difference, yes Morgan they are noisy, BUT,, so much better than walking into a rain zone.. West Mechanical will be working in the pool starting next Wednesday, Jared Payne will be building a plank to go over the pool on Monday, so that WM can access the ceiling. I hesitate to give out the bad news to people who are coming during that time to quickly though because WM said that every afternoon when they are finished for the day, they should be able to move their stuff out of the way, so that the pool can reopen. How about this, for Monday and Tuesday we keep it closed, (since Jared will be building in there)Wednesday we see how it goes with WM and then determine the follow week by that. We will be able to give out passes to the Health Club for any unhappy guests who want to swim and workout. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask me..\r\n    Happy Friday…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2008 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    NWDBC – GROUP\r\n    Northwest Regional Development for Biology Meeting at the labs will be held March 12 to 15. Participants of that group will stay with us and will receive a discount, depending on how many rooms we rent (between 10% and 20%, will be applied on day of arrival).\r\n    Please make reservations for that group as follows: if a guest identifies himself as a participant of NWDBC, type those letters in the search field of WRP, a group folio will show up. Open the group folio, go to “add new reservation” and make a reservation as usual, take deposit, send confirmation, etc. Don’t apply the discount yet.\r\n    If a guest identifies himself as a participant after you already made a reservation, finish the reservation as usual, write down confirmation number, then find the group folio, open it, click on “edit group folio”, scroll all the way down and type the confirmation number in the provided field under “add existing reservations”. Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    A RING TRAVEL GROUP\r\n    Is a travel agency we have a contract with. They fax reservation requests, similar to the Clipper. When one arrives, make a reservation as usual (you’ll only get: guest name, how many guests, how many rooms, how many nights) and attach it to the corporate account “A Ring Travel”, then select the corporate rate when selecting a room. Finish the reservation as usual, only difference: don’t take deposit & press “suppress pricing on receipt”, something we need to get in the habit of doing for Clipper & Elderhostel as well.\r\n    Then, instead of emailing a confirmation (you won’t have an email address for the guest), write the confirmation number on the fax you received, date, sign and fax back to the agency (fax number is on the reservation request). Put faxed request in the box on the back desk for another person to double check. After the reservation has been double checked, file in “A Ring Travel” folder in my file cabinet.\r\n    Be careful with those. I had one today requesting 6 rooms all at once. Remind me to go over one of those with each of you. It’s much easier to show than describe.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    I got your day off requests. Please always ask for the entire week off, not just your regular scheduled days, so I know not to schedule you at all, ever during those weeks. I want to hear you play sometime. Will you give me a concert in the lobby?\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday Everyone!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Please remember to let Housekeeping know that rooms 111 and 114 are dirty for tomorrow since the people did not leave until after noon.\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY LAURA\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Laura, Happy Birthday, have a WONDERFUL day:)\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2008 at 10:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you boss lady’s for being the best ever!!!\r\n\r\n    LAURA..you know whats coming, Happy Birthday!\r\n\r\n    Steffi I read the 86st list, and added a nick name of my own :)\r\n\r\n    oh and by the way…your element’s employee quiz was incredibly hillarious\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2008 at 11:21 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    New information about a change in whale watching and kayaking for summer. San Juan Safaris is downsizing and handing off all kayaking in Friday Harbor and Roche Harbor, and the whale watching out of Roche to San Juan Outfitters. San Juan Outfitters is a new company headed by Brian Goodremont, former San Juan Safaris employee. Until Brian gets his own website and phone line up and running we are to call San Juan Safaris regarding any kayaking from FH /RH or whale watching trips out of Roche.\r\n    Price List is as follows:\r\n    Whale Watching – $69.00 for Adults / $49.00 for Kids\r\n    Kayaking – $69.00 for a 3hr trip / $85.00 for a 5hr trip\r\n\r\n    I know this makes life a little bit more confusing for us but as soon as Brian has everything lined up we will have more information and be able to make specialized vouchers for San Juan Outfitters.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 27th, 2008 at 4:55 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    As of today, you will find two kinds of gift certificates in the basket on top of the safe: ELEMENTS hotel vouchers & spa, DSI, STEPS, FHH vouchers. The latter say “Gratuity not included” and have an extra line: “at”, to write where the voucher can be redeemed (i.e. at Lavendera Day Spa, or STEPS wine bar & cafe). So please use the ELEMENTS hotel vouchers for room gift certificates only. Use the others for massages and dining credits. Aaand, assemble some every shift, please!\r\n\r\n    MORGAN & CINDY\r\n    Please let Priscilla & Elena know where we blog now.\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY & WEDNESDAY\r\n    We have a massage workshop in the conference center. I’ll make sure the room is set up correctly. The organizer will show up right at 8 AM on Tuesday morning. Workshop participants will arrive throughout the next two days and may need to be picked up from the ferry (they will all travel with their massage tables). Regino knows, but please remind him.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S FILM TIP\r\n    I just finished watching Spike Lee’s “When the Levees broke”, a four part requiem for New Orleans, a documentary about Katrina and the 9 months afterwards. I was so impressed, I highly recommend it. What touched me most was the sense of place the people of this city have.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2008 at 11:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan, I restarted guest computer, still no internet connection, can you fiddle around with that, please?\r\n    Happy shift, see you soon.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2008 at 6:43 pm\r\n\r\n    THE DANCERS\r\n    Room 106 did check out after all. So the room needs to be cleaned, please let HK know. Room 206 came back and checked back in for another night. The organizer called, she had received a message from us that one party had brought a pet in a non-pet room, who was that?\r\n\r\n    #1007924\r\n    Morgan, is this a direct bill? No credit card and still in NEW section.\r\n\r\n    Happy “Showing of the baby Jesus” party, everyone. If you love me, bring me some food!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please contact the spa and see if you can book a 60 min side by side Saturday late afternoon for # 1008543, if not, ask what they have Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n    Also: can you have Raquel get us some small garbage bags, I couldn’t find any.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the tip, Adam.\r\n    Cindy, Dave and I are working on a scheme were we are trying to convince their boys to clean up last year’s storm damage on their property, cut it and I’ll buy it from them. But somehow the boys got wind of the fact that hauling and cutting wood is real hard work. We’ll see.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    The guy you took a reservation for today is not part of the U of WA group I made arrangements with, he is just part of a seminar on 3/12 and happens to stay with us, the other seminar is in fact on 4/12.\r\n\r\n    DONATIONS\r\n    need to be approved by Cindy or Laura. When putting a donation gift certificate into WRP, make the room status “gift certificate, room still available”, then write in the “guest remark” section for which room style the donation is, which organization we donated to, and the restrictions, then, and this is new:\r\n\r\n    make it a complimentary reservation\r\n\r\n    and don’t forget to write it down in the gift certificate log (under the front desk).\r\n\r\n    86st GUESTS\r\n    I created a word document on the desktop of my computer with above title. In it you’ll find the names & descriptions of guests who are no longer allowed on the premises and the reasons why. Please read it.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S SONG IN MY HEAD\r\n    Spider Pig, by Homer Simpson, oh yeah.\r\n    “Can he jump from a web? No he can’t he’s a pig!”\r\n    That doesn’t even rhyme. I love it.\r\n    adam Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Steffi,\r\n\r\n    I just bought about a cord-and-a-half of nice firewood from a young man named Nick for $200. They stacked it all under my porch for an extra $20 (I tipped another $10 since it took three of them over an hour). Seems like the best firewood deal I’ve made in a while, so thought I’d pass on his number, in case you’re still looking. 317-5118. He said they had lots of wood.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 5:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Please remember to ask Steffi or I about the people we will no longer be letting stay at the hotel. There have been a few situations that happened and we do not allow that kind of behavior here.\r\n    Friday, are you glad it is here. I am Khaili gets to suit up for the girls varsity team tonight for a 6:00pm basketball game, she is excited although she is worried she may have to sit on the bench.. I doubt it, she is one tough cookie.\r\n    Birthday’s\r\n    Tomorrow is Dave’s 40th birthday….\r\n    Seth will be …. I think he told me 42yrs old, I highly doubt it I think he is trying to make me feel good:)\r\n    Happy Birthday to both of you wonderful people.\r\n    Next week we have one of our special people turning 41yrs old.. Guess who???? They really look 29…\r\n    The phones are ringing, ringing, and ringing again,,, YAHHHH…\r\n    It’s too busy now days to do any homework here at the office, so get your front desk hat on. Unless there is no phone calls at ALL… which we hope that is not the case.\r\n    We will know more about the pool building on Monday..\r\n    Onity should be coming in the next 2 weeks for the key cards.\r\n    Have a great weekend…\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Yes, this is the new location of the front-desk log. We decided yesterday that those rare guests with a robust curiosity about the inner workings of our hybrid hotel project, and enough time to exercise it to exhaustion, ought to be rewarded (punished?) with unrestricted access to our thought processes.\r\n\r\n    The theme here is “Warts and All.” Reading over the front desk log since we started it, what I see is heaps of evidence that you guys care deeply about the customer experience here. Sure, there are some embarrassing moments that most hotels would go to great lengths to conceal. ELEMENTS is not like that, though. I think it’s great for our guests to have the chance to see how we approach adversity and conflict, along with the warm fuzzy stuff. Please continue to speak freely, don’t censor yourself in any way; but do be careful to not include names, passwords or private information.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS San Juan Island hotel & spa is a special place, refreshingly unlike any hotel or motel I’ve seen, and an open-access front-desk log is a perfect expression of our guest-first approach to lodging. Enjoy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    HoooKayy… Steffi. Apparently idle hands are the Devil’s playthings. “Kimono Nights” is not the name of the Anime series I am watching, only the episode on the disc. And in my defense, in case anyone has ideas to the contrary, it is not animated porn. Thank you and good night.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    You are a wonderful goofball! Clearly you have too much time on your hands.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 11:04 am\r\n\r\n    ARE YOU A TRUE ELEMENTONIAN?\r\n    TAKE THE TEST TO FIND OUT:\r\n\r\n    1) How many gift certificates are you supposed to make per shift?\r\n    a) 4\r\n    b) I have too much homework to do to actually work at work\r\n    c) We make them?

I showed them some of our renovated rooms and they were really impressed.\r\n    Our crown jewel, building E, was their pet friendly rooms, because they were their oldest rooms. They barged building D here from Whidbey Island, it used to be an apartment building there. And they built the conference center on top of building B; it is free standing.\r\n    Another local couple stopped by earlier to see our conference center were they got married some 20 years ago. Now they are planning their daughter’s wedding.\r\n    I love that so much, Laura and Adam, that you kept the structure, quirky as it is. You are doing something really unique here.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2007 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    How was that Halloween party? The decorations were great!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2007 at 6:25 pm\r\n\r\n    I heard a rumor about a staff Halloween party in a certain lobby of a certain sister hotel or ours? Is is true? Will we have one?\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2007 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    HI STEFFI AND EVERYONE!!!!\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the present Steffi, it is so cute!! I hope that the year goes well for everyone… I will be around and will probably see you all. Luv you guys!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2007 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    This Sunday is Rachael’s last shift (for now, I hope:)\r\n    I’m not sure I’ll survive the winter without you popping into the lobby, always exactly at the right moment, and putting something freshly baked on my desk.\r\n    Thank you so much for all your hard work. I remember the day you came back to ELEMENTS and I wanted to let you know all the little things which need to be done that day and you had tackled every single one already (it’s like riding a beach cruiser, no?)\r\n    Good luck with school, don’t be a stranger, I’ll miss you.\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2007 at 6:15 pm\r\n\r\n    GOODBYE LILLY!!! HAVE FUN AT SCHOOL!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2007 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh Lilly,\r\n    I’m gonna miss you. Your sense of humor is really something else (” the hotel is gonna be called “Log Book?”). Have a great time at college and don’t forget us, by which I mean: come and work for us next summer.\r\n    Love, Steffi\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2007 at 12:04 pm\r\n\r\n    So I’m leaving soon :( …we need to have an end of the summer work party before I go, I don’t want to miss out!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2007 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Steffi,\r\n    Thanks again for the camping recommendations. At this point, our next camping trip will be at the end of August. We’re taking the kids out for our annual week-long rafting trip on the Main Salmon out in Idaho. The girls and I make a little party out of our gear raft and Adam show-boats (pun intended) for us in his kayak. We get to the beach at about 2 in the afternoon, set up camp and play in the water for the rest of the day. The next morning we pack it all up and start all over again.\r\n    It’s a lot of fun and if we’re lucky we’ll not only see chipmunks, but elk and moose. If we’re not lucky, we’ll just see bear at night eating our food…which has happened before and will probably happen again…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2007 at 7:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Laura,\r\n    Here is another camping tip: it’s a little bit further away than the North Cascade Highway but definitely worth it: the Gifford Pinchot National Forest north of Mt St Helens. You go down I-5 and take Highway 12 east (a little south of Centralia), go to Randle and then take forest road 23 up into the mountains. D + I stayed at Horseshoe Lake last summer. Absolutely gorgeous, the Glacier in the background, camped right by the lake. I learned how to fish there. The water was cool but not too cold to swim, the air was crystal clear, the scenery breath taking. We were there in the middle of the summer season but mid week and it was not crowded. Beware of the chipmunks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2007 at 8:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Laura & Adam:)\r\n    We missed you. Tell us about San Diego.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2007 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey you wonderful staff and boss people:\r\n    Thank you for making it possible for me to go camping and fishing for a couple of days. See you all Friday:)\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2007 at 8:17 am\r\n\r\n    There is a great running loop from town around Pear Point Rd., out Argyle, past Jackson’s Beach and the gravel pit, then around the point and back in on Warbass. This loop sees little traffic, has a couple of beach access points, is fairly flat, has some great scenery and easy access from ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n    For swimming, it’s one of life’s great disappointments that the crystal clear waters around San Juan Island are never warm enough for mere mortals to swim in. Even when it’s 90 degrees out our waters barely top the high 40s. The only exceptions are Eagle’s Cove and False Bay, where the water is warm enough for some when the sun heats up the tidal flats at low tide, then the sand heats up the water as the tide comes in. There’s a window of swimming opportunity to be had there, if you are so inclined. Otherwise, I’ve had some enjoyable swims at Lakedale where you can pay a fee to swim in the lake and at Egg Lake.

My first whale sighting after moving here was kind of like that, but really early on a foggy morning. There was no one around, no boats, and I could hardly believe what I was seeing, and hearing.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2007 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    I had my first whale sighting for the season today! This morning was so pretty the sun was shining and I felt like going for a walk so around 10:20 I drove out to the Westside and as I got there I noticed people out on the rocks with binoculars and quite a few boats on the water. After parking and starting my way down one of the trails on the main road I looked carefully out onto the water and there it was a shiny black fin poking out of the water then another right after it, and after the I heard the sound of water escaping and orcas blow hole. They were out there for a good while and they were real close to the shore. Today was a great reminder of why I love the island so much and why so many people come here, It is beautiful.\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2007 at 11:23 am\r\n\r\n    Lilly where are you going to school next year, did you like the graduation party?\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2007 at 7:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone, It is great to be back to this nice cool weather!

Let me know if you have any trouble with the new instructions. I think you’re on page three.

A big thanks to Rachael for managing to track down some of my college buddies and have them show up to the party. It was a great surprise.

I will try to put the new parts on as soon as we get them.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 6th, 2007 at 12:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Morgan,\r\n\r\n    Don’t worry about ordering those bike parts we talked about yesterday. I got online this morning and ordered some Salsa quick-release clamps with overnight shipping. They should come in Tuesday or Wednesday. If I’m not there, do you think you might find time to pull all the seats and replace the old clamps with quick release, saving all the old ones in a ziplock or box for emergency use? We need to set up a bike parts/tools box? Maybe I’ll go to Brown’s and get something for that so your tools (and mine) don’t start to disappear…. Thanks Mo.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2007 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Crew,\r\n\r\n    Thanks to everyone for helping pull the party off today. That was a major undertaking and you guys all did great. Thanks!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2007 at 6:41 am\r\n\r\n    Thanks Rachael! You might also put something up down at Friday’s about the Elements Beach Cruisers. We might bring a few down there later in the season, but for now guests at Friday’s can bring their driver’s license or credit card up to ELEMENTS and check out a bike whenever they want, subject to availability of course. By the way, everyone, bikes are first-come-first-served; no reservations. That’s really the only way to be fair to everyone, I think.

However, because Laura is the awesomest, here is our new spa incentive:\r\nSell 15 spa treatments (55 min or longer) and get a free treatment at our spa (under $100 in value). Is that awesome? I sure think it is. So keep track of your spa bookings and get massaged by the best in town.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON\r\nWe''ll do a promotion similar to groupon at Bird Rock the week of 4/2. Stay tuned for details.\r\n\r\nWe''ll add spa butler items to wrp, so our guests can add on a little baggie of mud bath or face treatments to their room....soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt''s all coming together, yeah!','filtered_html');

Trust us—the island''s high-caliber chefs serve up local fare in a very unlocal way, often using the bountiful fresh seafood that swims around up here. Much of the food comes directly from this group of islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children are welcome at all the restaurants, and you''ll find restaurants happy to cater to families dotted through Friday Harbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Winding Up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you''re about to get your day started, or want to kick-start it partway through, pause for coffee or a smoothie. Friday Harbor''s got coffee shops sprinkled in unexpected places, including a cozy one tucked into Griffin Bay Bookstore, and serves up refreshing cold concoctions in various venues, like the Sweet Retreat walk-up window featuring the ever-smiling Dave, and The Bean on First Street with fresh baked snacks and lighter fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Winding Down</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The wines of the Pacific Northwest speak for themselves and you can sample them at any of Friday Harbor''s restaurants, in the lounge bar or outside tables at The Bluff, or as you enjoy live music at the Rumor Mill—all within minutes of your San Juan Island lodging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Doing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You''ll walk through our small town of Friday Harbor quickly, but you won''t be lacking things to do.

Trust us—the island''s high-caliber chefs serve up local fare in a very unlocal way, often using the bountiful fresh seafood that swims around up here. Much of the food comes directly from this group of islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children are welcome at all the restaurants, and you''ll find restaurants happy to cater to families dotted through Friday Harbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Winding Up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you''re about to get your day started, or want to kick-start it partway through, pause for coffee or a smoothie. Friday Harbor''s got coffee shops sprinkled in unexpected places, including a cozy one tucked into Griffin Bay Bookstore, and serves up refreshing cold concoctions in various venues, like the Sweet Retreat walk-up window featuring the ever-smiling Dave, and The Bean on First Street with fresh baked snacks and lighter fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Winding Down</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The wines of the Pacific Northwest speak for themselves and you can sample them at any of Friday Harbor''s restaurants, in the lounge bar or outside tables at The Bluff, or as you enjoy live music at the Rumor Mill—all within minutes of your San Juan Island lodging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Doing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You''ll walk through our small town of Friday Harbor quickly, but you won''t be lacking things to do.

There are over five galleries in this town, each showcasing different work.  For high quality, diverse shows stop in at the <a href="http://www.waterworksgallery.com/" target="_blank">Waterworks Gallery</a> that routinely displays sculpture, paintings and jewelry from top, Pacific Northwest artists.  </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  Further downtown is the <a href="http://www.arcticravengallery.com/" target="_blank">Artic Raven Gallery</a>, displaying artwork from Artic and Northwest Coast Native Americans.  The gallery’s collection of masks, wood carvings and prints represents local people including Coast Salish, Kwagullth, and Makah nations. <br />\r\n  San Juan’s own art museum, the San Juan Islands Museum of art (IMA),  is just up the road and makes it its mission to provide engaging shows of Northwest and Southwest Canadian artwork.

Ask the Earthbox Motel and Spa staff for exact directions, or take a scenic Westside drive and watch out for the look-out car parks.</p>\r\n<h2>Beaches</h2></p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Juan Island does beaches well.  Whether you want big and exposed or small and sheltered, there is something for everyone.  Got a kite? Why not head to South Beach. At two miles long, with a view of the Olympic Mountains, South Beach is a playground of sand, pebbles and drift wood.   Pack lunches can be eaten at the many picnic tables and there are plenty of easy hikes to be found at neighboring American Camp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further around the coast is the less visited but equally rewarding Fourth of July Beach. This stretch of sand is a little more off the beaten path and offers a great view of Mt. Baker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If small and sheltered is your style then Deadman''s Bay is a must-see. A gem of the coastline, the cove is dotted with Madrone trees, rock pools, and sheltered by the cliffs of the island''s Westside. With ample shady spots to spread out a blanket, it seems to be designed for those who want to relax and watch nature drift by.  Watch out for the Orca whales as they cruise the Haro Strait. Visit at low-tide and view tidepools full of small sea creatures on the rocks immediately west of Deadman''s Bay.</p>\r\n<h2>Trails</h2></p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is not only the island beaches that provide the opportunity to explore the coastline.  Lime Kiln State Park offers an array of leafy hikes that take you past rock formations, the historical coastal lime kilns, and the park''s lighthouse. Once there, you don''t need a vehicle to head south along the Westside. Leave your car at Lime Kiln Sate Park and pick up the easy trail that winds its way along the coast to Deadman''s Bay, a perfect place to rest and enjoy the view. Lime Kiln is also known as Whale-Watch Park. Find a picnic table, relax, and if you''re lucky and patient, you may even see Orcas and other whale species feeding in the surrounding waters. </p>','','full_html');

Mount Young is a perfect way to experience both the island''s nature and history.  On your way up to the sunny 650 foot high summit you will pass an 1860s British Marine Cemetery which dates back to the joint British and American military occupation.

If she calls back (name and note is on my desk) please give her the same info I gave her previously: we can NOT use the groupon at BR, but if she really doesn’t want to stay at EB, book a room with us at BR, we have a fantastic special going on (25%off 2 nights, any room)and call groupon back for a refund (they do that, no questions asked).

They have a policy that only the guest can cancel. I left msg with guest to please do that.\r\n    And onward.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2012 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK – WE’VE GOT A PROBLEM\r\n    Just talked to Maria at Innlink (800-525-5864). She sees all these (3 total now, last one is #4034689) reservations timing out and needs to figure out why they time out and why the guests don’t get informed of that and why we don’t get them even when they get re-send. Our case number is: 61055\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2012 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all,\r\n\r\n    There were a couple of issues with reservations today that were booked through online places like Kayak.com and Expedia. We had two guests show up/cal expecting to have a reservation tonight and we had no info on them. I called Innlink and they said the reservations “timed out” getting to us. We remade reservations for the folks but we don’t know if the online booking agencies already charged them or not. If they did we need to charge the CC#’s that the web agencies sent and refund the ones from the guests on file. The reservations in questions are 4033919 and 4033904. I added a “2″ to the end of their names so we don’t get any potential problems with the Innlink res’s coming in.\r\n\r\n    Please have housekeeping tidy 108. The folks in there stayed for over an hour then decided that the room “smelled funny.” Have them take a look please.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2012 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys,\r\n\r\n    The new special for March will be up on our website in a day or two, but in the meantime, here are the details, sell it!\r\n\r\n    stay 1 night and save 15%, stay 2 or more nights and save 25%, plus save 20% on spa services at The Spa Earthbox, our sister our property if you book at least 24 hours prior to your arrival. valid March, 2012. not valid with any other special. enter the promo code SAVE15 (for 1 night) or SAVE25 (for 2 or more nights) or mention this offer when booking your stay.\r\n\r\n    So, obviously, guests can’t book the spa treatment themselves, but you can give this to them when they book.\r\n\r\n    Go team!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2012 at 3:53 pm\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN MARATHON 3/23\r\n    So the organizers of this marathon send out a thing saying we would offer rooms for $99.

He is really appreciative of all the (deserved i.m.h.o.) recommendations we send their way so he would like Laura (he asked by name) to give him a call when she has a moment so that they might possibly do something for us as thanks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 24th, 2012 at 10:33 am\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN\r\n    Women’s marathon on March 23-25.

Just because right now it’s kind of hard to get a second therapist. But please don’t make it sound like we don’t want to provide the SBS service, just ask as if you want to clarify:)\r\n\r\n    INNLINK\r\n    There are certain innlink reservations (you know it’s them because you get an alarm saying: warning you may be overbooked) where the guest paid the travel agent already and the travel agent provides a card which we’ll charge after check out. Here is how you handle those:\r\n    1) Don’t charge anything when they make reservation\r\n    2) IMPORTANT: suppress pricing\r\n    3) Write in guest remark section: put guest cc in remark section, charge travel agent card upon check out, pricing suppressed\r\n    4) set alarm for check out date saying: 2/19 check out: charge travel agent card\r\n    5) double check that pricing is suppressed\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have any questions.

We ran out of lamination sheets so we’ll have to wait until we get some more before I can finish the new maps. The back printer seems to be acting up. It keeps saying that there is no paper in the tray and therefore will not print. It’ll print fine if you are using the side feed drawer. Please tell Chris if he swings by before I am on shift.

Dave will look at it today.\r\n\r\n    SPA MEETING\r\n    Don’t forget our spa orientation on Thursday at noon. if you can’t make it, please re-schedule with Rachael. her email is rachael@earthboxmotel.com.\r\n\r\n    Have a happy week everybody!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2012 at 11:30 am\r\n\r\n    FEBRUARY SPECIAL\r\n    Sprinter or Wring?\r\n\r\n    What do you call this lovely time in the Pacific Northwest when the first Spring flowers are coming, the sun is shining and love is in the air in February? Sprinter, Wring? Regardless, this is a great time to treat your Sweetie and yourself to a well-deserved getaway.\r\n\r\n    Sprinter: Book a Body or Face treatment (55 min or longer) at the Spa at Earthbox and get a Water Place for only $99 plus tax per night.\r\n\r\n    (2 night minimum, not valid with any other specials, room and spa treatment must be booked over the phone at the same time, subject to availability, offer ends 02/29/2012, room upgrades are available for an additional fee)\r\n\r\n    Wring: Relaxed enough; just need to get away? Let’s do it! Get a Water Place for just $129 plus tax per night when you stay 2 nights or more.\r\n\r\n    (2 night minimum, not valid with any other specials, use password WRING subject to availability, offer ends 02/29/2012, room upgrades are available for an additional fee)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2012 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    we are shooting to open on 3/1/12. Up until then all our treatments are available EXCEPT the nail care.\r\n\r\n    ALL spa clients are allowed to use the pool, sauna and hot tub for an hour before or after their treatment at no charge.\r\n\r\n    When booking any body treatment, please advise clients not to shave the day before.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 2nd, 2012 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please make sure to update the HK report in WRP once Rachel and Regino submit the hard copy in the afternoon. It totally throws them off the next morning if we don’t update.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Yes, it’s only February, but Clipper bookings have started. Please read up on last year’s procedures in the front desk manual and make, cancel, alter those bookings and confirm them on the Clipper extranet site. And don’t forget, when you see Clipper bookings in the box on the back desk, double check them and file away.\r\n\r\n    RECYCLING\r\n    Here is what I found out, RE recycling:\r\n    batteries – ACE hardware\r\n    light bulbs – OPALCO\r\n    bigger batteries – contact manufacturer and inquire about their recycling program.\r\n\r\n    So please make sure to never throw batteries or light bulbs in the trash. The squiggly light bulbs have mercury in them and our soil & water don’t need that. Put them aside for Seth to collect. The batteries just run down to Ace real quick. It’s not easy being green, but we do it anyways!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2012 at 5:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Khai\r\n    There are a couple of things that Cindy needs done on Wednesday(2/1). One the back desk there are a few envelopes.\r\n    1) NEEDS to be delivered early\r\n    2) Needs to be copied then the original laminated.\r\n    3) & 4) are for Rachael N.\r\n    Welp, that’s what she wanted me to pass on. Have a good day and I’ll check in with you before you close. :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2012 at 5:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys,\r\n\r\n    The new Spa menu is up on the Earthbox website. You may get people asking about nails because that is on there, too. Just kindly let people know that we won’t be doing nails until March.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 23rd, 2012 at 5:45 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY COMPUTER & VIDEO SCREEN\r\n    is all fixed. yeah! Happy week, everybody!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 22nd, 2012 at 10:10 am\r\n\r\n    WHAT A TRIP!!!!!!

It’s a Rock Island thing. Chris will try to fix it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    The wind is so strong that the covers don’t stay put (believe me I tried). left them off for now.\r\n\r\n    Can’t wait to see you all!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 3rd, 2012 at 5:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy New Year Everyone!\r\n\r\n    OUR NEW JANUARY SPECIAL IS UP:\r\n\r\n    $99 Post Holiday Recovery\r\n\r\n    After the holiday hustle and bustle are you looking to relax?

Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY\r\n    When making reservations for January, please let our guests know that we will be open from 9:00AM to 5:00PM every day. Make a note in their reservation, so we don’t call them again.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please don’t forget to check out guests in WRP around noon and, more importantly, update the HK report after housekeeping is done cleaning all the rooms. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2011 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    JOHN FROELICH\r\n    has 1/2 hour DT massage with Rach tomorrow at 1PM. Please have him fill out a spa form and charge him $55. He is not a guest.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2011 at 9:45 am\r\n\r\n    ROBIN TURNER\r\n    A former guest is interested in buying a robe from us. I put a new one in my office with her name on it. It’s $60 plus tax. Thank you.\r\n    P.S. If you ever have an inquiry like that, ask Rachel if we have enough robes and then sell away:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 18th, 2011 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    When you redeem a gift certificate, please make sure that you change the reservation status from “gift cert only room still available” to “confirmed”. Otherwise the reservation is not on the books. Not such a big deal now (other than us looking not too bright), but in the summer this could be a disaster.\r\n\r\n    CANDLES\r\n    Will you please put a little water on the bottom of the candle holders after you clean them? It’s hard to clean them otherwise.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 8th, 2011 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK RESERVATION\r\n    Beware when making reservations over the phone to make the reservation for the right hotel. We had several guests who thought they booked for BR, but we put them at EB without them knowing. Not good, not good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2011 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK NEW SPECIAL NEW SPECIAL\r\n    Stay one night in December and save 20% by entering the password: dazzle20. Staying 2 nights or more, save 30% by entering the password: dazzle30. Or call 1-800-352-2632 and mention this offer when booking your stay.\r\n    Valid December 2 through December 31, 2011. Not valid with any other special.\r\n\r\n    Remember: when a guest doesn’t know about the special by all means promote it, but choose the regular rate when making the booking and manually adjust the price.\r\n\r\n    Let’s get some folks staying with us. Happy room selling!\r\n\r\n    And: don’t forget to check the BR WRP for bookings while we are closed down there!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2011 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan made this cool set up for the wreath on the front door to be outside even when we are closed. so just re-hang it on the front door after we open and the closed sign gets put away.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2011 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    •Rachel has Mondays off, so no massages on Mondays for now.\r\n\r\n    •Rachel will need a 15 minutes turn around time between appointments, 30 minutes is better.\r\n\r\n    •All new clients must fill out a health form (on back desk). Even clients Rachel has seen before need to fill out a form, since this is a new business now.\r\n\r\n    •Rachel will take those forms from us when she picks up the client.\r\n\r\n    SPA SCHEDULE\r\n    The spa schedule (which appointment times are open)as of 12/1/11 is also in the folder with the health forms. When a guest calls, have a look, you may make appointment right there and then, call Rachel right away. She will do the same if she takes appointments.\r\n\r\n    Uiieeeh, great fun! We have a spa! Almost!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2011 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Laura wanted to pass along that she ordered a bunch of supplies and wants to make sure they are delivered to the front desk and are not sent back to housekeeping before she has the opportunity to check them out. Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all. Just letting you know that Heidi, the lady doing the Girl Scout meeting in the conference room, will be needing coffee, hot water, and ice set up on Tuesday. The meeting should start around 6pm. There are air pots and an ice bucket up there already from Monday night. If you have any questions you can call her. She has a room here. Rez #3750063. Although this is mostly a reminder for me since I’ll be the only one here at that time… :D\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 3:01 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON LIMIT 1 PER VISIT\r\n    Just a clarification because it came up today: “limit 1 per visit” means: no, a guest can not buy 2 groupons and make a 4 night stay out of it. 2 nights would be covered by a groupon, the next 2 nights would be at our regular or special rate if we have a special.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2011 at 1:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Beginning December 1st, all spa reservations are to be made directly through Rachel. She can be reached at 298.0556\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2011 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Dan Miller came in and asked to borrow a few of our airpots for the high school turkey feed. His tele is 378-2406 if they are not returned by Monday AM. He is aware that we need them for the conference room on Monday. And he has 3 of them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2011 at 11:17 am\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    Hookay! Now we are redeeming. The redemption code must be all upper case. Please put it in WRP like that so we can cut and paste it into the Groupon website. Also: Please make sure you write down the code correctly (which we haven’t yesterday). We can’t retrieve the code from anywhere, just from the guest. And: make sure to write down the groupon code as well.\r\n    Tory and Morgan stapled paper groupons to the guest’s invoice yesterday. Great idea. Let’s do that.\r\n\r\n    Then: even groupons which have been redeemed via I-phone app, still need to be redeemed in the groupon website with the dollar amount B4 taxes the guest spent here (i.e. groupon amount + candle + dog fee + extra person charge, etc.)\r\n\r\n    I know it all sounds complicated, but it isn’t. Just read you cheat sheet, pay attention and things will be fine.\r\n    Happy grouponing!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 19th, 2011 at 9:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all,\r\n\r\n    The monitor on the back desk computer was having issues today. It was only only activating every other line of pixels. Unplugging it from the power for a few seconds then plugging it back in fixed it. I went and got the spare monitor from BR just in case it does give up the ghost. The spare monitor may or may not be functional, we’re not sure. If need be I own an extra monitor we can borrow until a replacement comes. Just let me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2011 at 4:03 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    We have quite a few Groupon check-ins today. Make sure you get the redemption code and make sure you redeem those codes on the Groupon website when guests check in or latest when they check out.\r\n\r\n    Also: sold out of the weekend groupon deals. make sure you know what to say when people want to upgrade from a midweek to a weekend stay (read cheat sheet, Groupon counts as cash)\r\n    Happy Grouponing!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2011 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Have you guys seen the new WRP updates? There is a recent update which allows us to send an automatic email to guests after their stay. How great would it be to send a little thank you note and a link to tripadvisor?? :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 17th, 2011 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi hi hi,\r\n    Staci Baker will be coming in from time to time to get a pool key, her mother will be using the pool as per Cindy.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 16th, 2011 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    FYI, the WSF will be running an extra trip from Anacortes to Friday Harbor on Wednesday, November 23 at 1:30 p.m. in order to move traffic earlier and reduce backups – if needed.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 14th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON\r\n    Oh yeah, baby! Please find the groupon cheat sheets on the back desk. Take time to really read it. Sit at a computer, pull up the groupon website. Make sure you understand it all and then, go get ‘em!!!!!\r\n    I’m at home tomorrow, please don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Please check the BR WRP during the days we are closed down there. Right now we are waiting to hear from a guest who wants a massage…..\r\n\r\n    CANDLES\r\n    Cindy is not having it (go Cindy!!!!!!). So until Cindy and the town guy talk we have candles. Maybe there will be a boxing match in the lobby?\r\n\r\n    Tere, Orosco and Karla said good bye today. I will miss them!:(\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for you hard work and for hanging in there!\r\n    Love, s\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 4:00 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPON PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n    They will send a photographer out in the next few days. Please go all out, show them to empty rooms to take pictures, be super nice, make sure the lobby and the property look tip top, you know…..\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 1:23 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    Diane Luderman called to inquire about the conference center on Saturday 11/12 for a memorial. I quoted her $50, so you know when she calls back.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2011 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    GROUPON INTRODUCTION\r\n    Starting next Tuesday, 11/15 we will have a coupon on Groupon for one week. During that week we anticipate huge phone traffic. We are adding a 10-7 shift.\r\n\r\n    It is absolutely pertinent that we all know exactly what the coupon is for and what not, how it is applied, etc. We can’t afford mistakes.\r\n\r\n    The boss ladies will have a conference call today where we learn all the details. We’ll keep you posted, this is just an introduction.\r\n\r\n    Folks will buy a 2 night stay in water or earth, good through 4/30/12, different price for weekdays and weekends (Thurs/Fri stays and Sat/Su stays are considered weekend stays) directly on the Groupon site. Then call us to make reservations.\r\n\r\n    There are ways to upgrade, use the weekday coupon on the weekend, use the coupon as cash value after the offer expires, all this and how we’ll put those reservations in WRP we’ll teach you later. just wanted to give you a heads up. Uuiiiihhhhh, wouldn’t that be something, to be slammed in November? Love it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2011 at 6:13 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Dave and Morgan got the hot tub to work, yeah! The power outage probably fried something and Dave by-passed it. He will call tech support tomorrow and see if he can get that fixed. Just know: we have a tiny pool party on Wednesday. If hot tub is under construction or is not working, call those folks right away. Better yet: schedule repairs for a different time.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2011 at 2:22 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Something happened to the hit tub during the power outage yesterday. It’s cold right now. Please apologize to guests and say we are working on it. Morgan says Dave needs to have a look. I have a call in to Dave. Will keep you posted.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    November 4th, 2011 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, we have a new flat rate postage log notebook so we can now send out items guests have left behind and keep a log of it (including a label to stick in the logbook).This is printed from the USPS.com website. Have a great weekend and remember to change your clocks back by an hour this Sat. nite/Sun. morning. ;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2011 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Innlink Res #F1S7XGREM was a no show at closing. Innlink placed them in a pet room but often this is a mistake. Therefore I left 2 sets of keys for Regino to give them. 325 if they brought a dog and 322 if not. I blocked out 322 just in case. So Khai, if they ended up taking 322 please unblock it and move their reservation. You will also need to take the pet fees off their res. Just unblock it otherwise if they stayed in 325. Thanks.\r\n    (ps don’t forget to check people out kthxbai)\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    October 23rd, 2011 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Per Raquel, I closed Rm 311 for several days due to clogs in sink and tub.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2011 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    Please check the schedule that is posted, there have been some changes to it.. Thank you everyone for your patience..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2011 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETING\r\n    Yeah! We will have an all front desk staff meeting on Monday 10/24 at noon at Earthbox. Please all come to discuss how this season went for us, what will happen next and how we can make things good. See you then!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2011 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Tory,\r\n\r\n    Hope the conference room thing goes smoothly for you (as much as possible anyway.) Just a few things for you to know.\r\n\r\n    309 has a bathtub draining problem. So much so that the tub is full of water and not going down. Seth came in to take a look but He could not fix it. He will need to rent a professional drain snake on Monday. I gave the folks in there keys to 303 so they can take showers in the morning. Please let housekeeping know that it will need a cleaning after the folks are done.\r\n\r\n    Thanks.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2011 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    just a reminder, we need to pay close attention to the innlink reservations that come in with the travel agent cc on file. They give pretty detailed instructions on what to do, but we are somehow still missing them and essentially double charging the guests. See reservations F1S7XAMR7 F1S7XAMRL.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2011 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n    I just want to say that I would really appreciate it if I could be given a heads-up to any birthday parties or large groups the pool house. :) Especially during the winter months. This time of year I base the chemical levels on how many guests we have. With an automatic feeder it’s really easy for the chemical levels to rise too high if no one is using the pool. Therefore, I plan for a certain amount of usage to balance the chemicals out. Too many people all of a sudden can make the levels drop such so that there isn’t enough chemicals to keep the water sanitized. Which, of course, can cause problems if someone has an “accident” in the pool or is sick. So for our guest’s sake and ours if the health department decides to show up. Please keep me informed of pool parties. Thank you!! :)\r\n\r\n    TL;DR – Tell Morgan if there are large groups/birthday parties coming to use the pool.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 7th, 2011 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    First off:\r\n    Kathy, there is a large group of people meeting in the conference room all day. We need to set up beverages for them. I have already set up as much as I can there are just a few things you are going to have to do in the morning. You need to make a carafe each of coffee and hot water. I set them behind the sink and labeled them. You will also need to go up to the conference room and fill each of the 8 pitchers on the tables with ice water. (the group person requested ice) Which means you will need to stop by the ice machine to fill up a couple baggies to take up with you first. Sorry. :( Steffi will be in the class so hopefully she will keep us notified if they are low on coffee/water. You may want to keep a second carafe full of each to replace it with when it is still morning. Good luck.\r\n\r\n    Secondly:\r\n    We are out of wine bottle openers again. Need to order more please.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2011 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Candles\r\n    What is happening to the candles that come without wicks in them? Are we throwing them away? Returning them for credit? If they are being tossed I would ask that you set them aside for me. I will make fire-starters so that when we light the fire place in the winter we can just use those to get it going. Let me know. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    I took the covers off the bikes because the wind was picking them up and making them fall off the bikes. The little drawcord string doesn’t get it tight enough to hold up against the wind. Any ideas about what to do with them? I was thinking a ratchet system like those used in lightweight cargo tie-downs for trucks. Think San Juan canvas could retrofit one into it?\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    REMINDER ABOUT SPECIAL PRICING\r\n\r\n    Pretty pretty please, pay attention to this. It is REALLY important.\r\n\r\n    ONLY use a special rate (i.e. Savor the San Juans) if someone specifically requests THAT rate (they say “savor”).\r\n\r\n    This doesn’t mean that you can’t give them a discounted price, but in that case, you need to select the STANDARD rate and then manually discount it.\r\n\r\n    When you don’t follow this procedure, it messes all of my marketing statistics up and that is a big problem!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2011 at 8:33 am\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Have call in to Printonyx to see when the map paper is ready. Please blog when they call back.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2011 at 11:03 am\r\n\r\n    Raquel asked me to order 1 dozen wine keys. Jared will deliver “very soon”. Thanks and enjoy the beautiful weather! It’s a nice day for a bike ride ;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 24th, 2011 at 9:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n\r\n    The spa called to tell us that starting on Monday the 26th, they will start going back to their winter schedule.\r\n    Monday through Thursday: open 12pm to 5:30pm\r\n    Friday though Sunday: open 9am to 5:30pm\r\n    tory Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2011 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    also the front desk, shelves, floors everything haas never ever looked so good and i had nothing to do with it…..go daytime people!!!! it’s soooo nice!\r\n    toe Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2011 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    building a & d’s water will be shut off from 11am to around 1pm. i made a note for the housekeepers to put in the rooms with stay overs and please let early arrivals know. the plumbers will be checkin with the front desk i’m sure before they do the shut down.\r\n    morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2011 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n    I hope the moving is going as smooth as possible for you Steffi. I really could have used your help tonight. Had a German guest with issues and the language barrier was making things a little difficult. Read notes on #F1S7MHM1Z for more info all.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2011 at 8:28 am\r\n\r\n    Here is our new October specials :)\r\n\r\n    $99 Savor the San Juans Special!\r\n\r\n    During all of October, enjoy the elements that make Earthbox Motel & Spa the most complete San Juan Island lodging experience at an unbelievable rate!

While they had it they were planning on replacing the brake pads so the van doesn’t squeal anymore. (yay!) However, they discovered that our wheel bearings were leaking so they are going to fix that then return the van to us early afternoon on Tuesday. (If everything goes well of course)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2011 at 2:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Map Paper ordered from Printoynx.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2011 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The new schedule is up and it’s all over the place for every single one of us, so please look closely, don’t assume things, go with the flow and have fun!\r\n\r\n    106\r\n    Had a leaky ceiling, probably from an overflowing bath tub upstairs. Seth is out sick and can’t deal with it. Our guest said it stopped as soon as the upstairs folks stopped taking showers, but if she is uncomfortable, let’s try to move her to a different room.\r\n\r\n    GOVERNMENT RATE\r\n    T’is the season for our lovely state worker guests to come up again. Starting in October we are able to match the government rate of $90 if the stay is for business and midweek. Just so you all know!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2011 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    - Check out my sweet new ride in the parking lot. 15 passenger rockin’ party bus. Classy. Seriously though, the hotel van is currently broken. It won’t stay running unless you keep your foot on the gas pedal. Finish Line Auto Repair will be by first thing on Monday to take a look. Until it is repaired we are renting the van from M&W. Please treat it with care, my name and credit card number are attached to its rental agreement. :D The lone key will be in cash drawer please make sure it is returned each time it is used. Thank you kindly.\r\n\r\n    - We are running low on map paper. Please call on Monday to order more.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2011 at 12:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Lovely Coworkers,\r\n    I thought I’d let everyone know that San Juan Outfitters is no longer transporting guests to whale watch or kayak. They will need to have their own vehicle or get a taxi. Also remember POWER OUTAGE is tomorrow night(from 11pm-6am). The Road Scholar group all have flashlights (18) that I gave to Emily today.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2011 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a few FYI’s\r\n\r\n    - The orange bike on my deck has a puncture in it’s front tire. It will not hold air. Please have Seth look at it or take it over to Island Bicycles for repair.\r\n\r\n    - The makeup bags in the back office need to go to Post San Juan. They need to be overnighted to the guest. Please make sure they make it up there before package pick-up happens.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2011 at 11:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all!\r\n\r\n    This is a CODE: BRONZER ALERT! There are two make-up bags in the back office that need to be taken up to Post San Juan on Saturday. I don’t even know if they ship out on a weekend but it is VERY important that we try our best to get them out. The guest who left them doesn’t have any back-up cosmetics and therefore needs the bags ASAP. Guest is willing to pay for overnight delivery and all that goodness. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2011 at 7:51 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Opalco scheduled another of those planned power outages on Thursday, 9/15, from 11:00PM to 6:00AM. Please put up the sign I made (already in sign stand under FD computer). Morgan called all the guests. I informed all group leaders. Make sure we have plenty of flash lights and batteries. Good luck!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 8th, 2011 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?\r\n    We’ll talk to all of you individually, but I wanted to give you a heads up about our Winter scheduling plans:\r\n    EB will be open 9:00AM to 9:00PM starting in November & December. The hotel stays open in January (office hours (9:00AM to 5:00PM). Cindy and I will staff it in January.\r\n    BR will be open Fri & Sat November & December & some Holidays, closed in January.\r\n    This means all of you will go down to part time in November. Please let me know ASAP if you would rather not be on the schedule at all rather than being part time. Let me know your plans. Thank you so much for a terrific season. I love you all!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 7th, 2011 at 8:43 am\r\n\r\n    Let’s all take a minute and breathe and reflect on what an amazing job you’ve done. You ALL contributed to this being a wonderful summer. I know it wasn’t always easy, but you did it, you kept our guests happy and the property looking great. Fantastic work! Thank you so very much for everything you did and do. I love you all!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2011 at 10:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi lovelies\r\n    Happy official end-of-summer! It has been a wonderful one.\r\n\r\n    Now that Cafe Zia is closed for the slower months, the opening shift will need to uncover the beach cruisers in the morning.\r\n    I made a couple detailed alarms for tomorrow morning. Kathy, our guests would really appreciate it if you followed up with those as soon as you can tomorrow.\r\n    Everything was very pleasant tonight, so quiet it seems like winter!\r\n    xo\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2011 at 12:21 pm\r\n\r\n    AND THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CONCLUDES OUR SEASON!!!\r\n    Great job, everybody. You totally rocked this year. Thank you soooo much!\r\n\r\n    INNLINK\r\n    Now we will get innlink reservations again where the guest paid a travel agent directly and we charge the travel agent’s cc after the guest checks out.\r\n    Remember:\r\n    1) Check EVERY innlink reservation and see if the guest’s name is on the credit card or something completely different.\r\n    2) If guest’s name on cc: take 10%, charge guest upon check-in, the usual.\r\n    3) If name is completely different (like Orbitz for example), suppress pricing (that’s the most important thing!!!), write note in guest remarks like that:\r\n    Pricing suppressed, charge travel agent’s cc after guest checks out, put guest’s cc in remark section for incidentals.\r\n    4)Upon check in, put the guest cc in remark section, don’t erase travel agent’s cc. Double check pricing is suppressed.\r\n    5) Upon check out, charge travel agent’s cc.\r\n    Questions? Ask C, L or S.\r\n\r\n    Love you!!!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2011 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey boxers-\r\n\r\n    201 has two beach cruisers that they kept locked up from tonight so they could use em in the a.m.\r\n\r\n    The “sign guy” has come and fixed the sign right next to building E at the beginning of the driveway; there was an A missing.\r\n\r\n    That’s all! See you on Thursday :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2011 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL & REGINO\r\n    will be off tomorrow, Monday, 8/29. Orosco will be in charge!\r\n\r\n    FERRY SCHEDULES\r\n    We are out. Please go get some more.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Make them, please.\r\n\r\n    Last push, be kind, have fun and make our guest’s stay memorable (in a good way only, please!)\r\n\r\n    Thanks for all your hard work!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    TRIPSTER\r\n    Press the F3 and read up on our special starting Sept 5: 2 nights, 1 free whale watch tour. Make sure you make it very clear that this includes 1 whale watch tour for 1 person only. If there are 2 persons in the party the second person will have to pay for the whale watch tour. Also: not valid with any other special or discount! Just so you know!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2011 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    We have a number of people coming to the island today and tomorrow for the Concourse d’Elegance car show. One or two of these folks will be driving electric vehicles and may need to plug them in. We DO have a place for them to plug in, but we DO NOT have the cords to do so.\r\n\r\n    The outlet (a NEMA14-50 220 connector) is on the wall of the pump house (between the spa and the garbage dumpsters). Guests should park in the gravel right next to the bushes. You will have to crawl behind the bushes to find the outlet (it is at chest height) on the pumphouse wall.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2011 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK CANCELLATION\r\n    Guys, please remember that we CAN’T cancel INNLINK reservations. The guest needs to cancel directly with their travel agent. This is important because the travel agents will charge us commission if we don’t cancel with them. Thank you!\r\n    tory Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2011 at 11:03 pm\r\n\r\n    please order h2o in the am we ran out this evening. something is screwy with steffi’s computer. call chris t. night night\r\n    courtney Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2011 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay guys, are you ready for this? I sure wasn’t. So Stevie’s mom was using the pool tonight at around 730ish – no one else was in there, then this guy is trying to open up the door around 8ish I am assuming. So Stevie’s mom opens it and asks if he has his room key and he goes “no but my girlfriend reserved a room here and is coming” and then just walks right passed her to the exercise room. He uses that and the sauna (butt-naked in the sauna with a towel over). Stevie’s mom is asking him questions to get him out of there because it was obvious that he was not a guest, but he kept making up excuses. THEN! All of a sudden the police show up and arrest him on a court ordered warrant. I was with a guest the entire time so I did not catch this on the TV. At about 8:20ish, Stevie’s mom comes in to tell me the story and I am just in shock. So I called the sheriff’s department to confirm the story and it is all true unfortunately. However, I am not sure if it is just me, but I feel like the police should have come in and told me, or called later and say “HEY! We arrested a guy in your pool house by the way and he was not a guest there.” Sure would have been nice to be informed by the actual people who arrested him, but whatever. Anyways, that was my night. I am not sure if we do anything else about this, seems to be taken care of but I have to admit, I was a little shaken up when it was officially confirmed. I am sooo sorry I never caught this on the screen. I wish I would have :/.\r\n\r\n    Good night everyone.\r\n\r\n    Courtney\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2011 at 10:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew. Toasty.\r\n    Of course the first truly hot day of the summer is followed by the first night without a breeze. Lot’s of warm folks. Take a look at 3495232 in particular.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2011 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Batteries. We have them. woot woot!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2011 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    BATTERIES\r\n    First thing tomorrow, please get AAA and some AA batteries from Ace. Very important. Please blog that you did it!\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2011 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    CASK & SCHOONER\r\n    Guys, Cask & Schooner does not take reservations, first come first serve only.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers. We are all out. And if you take the last voucher, make some right away or let your coworkers know, please!\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy weekend! Give ‘em your very best!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2011 at 6:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone!\r\n    If you could please keep an eye out for two loose keys. On is black and says L2 on it and the other is a little silver one that says L3. They belong to the cafe locks. Thank you!!\r\n    Caitlin Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2011 at 10:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey,\r\n    We have a TON of ferry schedules because I called and had them mail us a bunch. Want me to swing some by??\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2011 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    Just a few things:\r\n    - I used our last pair of AAA batteries. We will need to order more or run to the hardware store to get some.\r\n    - Read notes in Res#: 3449869\r\n    - We are just about out of summer ferry schedules. Someone needs to run down to the terminal an snag some more. Or see if BR has some to “borrow.”\r\n    - I refilled the hot tub tonight or will be as soon as I get off. If we can, try to keep the patio doors and pool house windows closed on Wednesday. It’ll help keep the place warm and speed up the hut tub’s reheat time. Thanks!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    O.K. I officially declare BEST GUESTS EVER day here at Earthbox.\r\n\r\n    First that nice family from Maryland had breakfast here and I just love those girls.\r\n\r\n    Kathy, the folks from New Jersey wanted you to know that they saw whales on their kayak trip and they had a blast.\r\n\r\n    Then, and that was really the kicker: this lady from New York checked out with me. Totally straight face, very serious, she said:”When we checked in the only room left was a pet room and the guy checking us in said he can only sell us the room if we have a pet. So we went down to the port and picked up a stray cat. We are leaving now. What do you want us to do with the cat?” My jaw dropped, eyes widened… and then she started laughing and giggling and dancing around, “Got you, got you!”. I haven’t laughed that hard for a while.\r\n\r\n    Love it. Thank you guests. You rock!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2011 at 4:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Guys, we need to lock the bikes. During the day and at night. Especially this time of the year. We can get in real trouble if somebody just takes one and something happens. Very important! Also: bikes need to be back before it gets dark.\r\n    The night person needs to make sure that the bikes are locked and the bike hoodies are on, regardless of weather. Please do so.\r\n\r\n    EMAILS\r\n    Please make sure all emails are dealt with by the end of the night. After you deal with emails, please file them away.\r\n\r\n    I know, it’s so busy. This is it, the tail end of our season. You are doing great. I know it’s hard. Look at the daily check list before you leave, every day, and make sure you did everything. And remember: our guests visiting now have the same right to outstanding customer service than the guests we served in June. We love them! They make it so we can eat!\r\n    Together we can do this! And don’t forget to have fun!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2011 at 4:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay boys and girls, I know it’s summer and I know you’re going crazy, but I want to say THANK YOU! You guys are all really amazing!!! Keep up the great work and remember that even though it’s the end of a long season to us, each and every guest that walks in the door deserves our very best as if it was the first day of summer.\r\n\r\n    Now, given that summer is almost over, it means that we’re back at it with another special. This one should sound familiar, it’s another TRIPSTER special. If a guest calls and mentions TRIPSTER, or if this shows up in an online reservation, it should be the following:\r\n\r\n    If a guest books two nights on a Sunday through Thursday night stay from September 5-October 15, then they get ONE free whale watch trip.\r\n\r\n    If you are booking the special for them, make sure to use the password: TRIPSTER when you make the reservation. If the reservation was made online, make sure that it was made for at least TWO nights.\r\n\r\n    And!!! don’t forget to get all the details and book the Whale Watch trip with SJS and make the voucher, etc. Questions? Just ask me.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2011 at 1:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Just a reminder that futons do not fit in water places and its realllly tight to put one in an earth place. Thank you guys!\r\n    Courtney Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2011 at 5:18 pm\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to say hi. This is my first season here but I can tell, August is our busiest time of the year and I just want to thank everyone for doing a great job under pressure! Of course we can always give that extra umph! But I have enjoyed working with everyone and will miss everyone once summer is over. I can’t wait till next year when I am actually 18 and get to drive the VAN WOOHOO :) . Anyways, just wanted to say GOOD JOB! Keep smiling because you are all wonderful. And just breathe and try your best to stay pleasant while it is busy, it can get frustrating but it will be okay! Okay I am done writing my novel :) .\r\n\r\n    Courtney\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2011 at 4:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hiya guys!\r\n    Just wanted to let everyone know, if anyone who is with the American Lung Association books with us we are giving them 10% off. Cindy gave the ok (:\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2011 at 9:18 am\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE RIDES\r\n    Please don’t promise shuttle rides at 8:00AM. We are all by ourselves and can’t just lock up and leave, with the lobby full of folks and the phones ringing. Regino gets here 8:30 or 9:00. Between 8 and 9, just promise folks to call them a cab. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please double check the Clipper booking reports on the back desk. That baskets is full and now is the time when potential mistakes would really matter.\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make more spa vouchers. We’ll need them!\r\n\r\n    Happy August everybody!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2011 at 6:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Well the fire alarm went off today at Bird Rock because a 2 year old pulled it in the Speiden Room. I followed the directions on the panel and tried to call the number on the wall for “false alarms” but I got a machine that said they were closed for the weekends. So I waited for the call from the fire department like the note says but I got no call. Instead I got a call from Khaili at Earthbox asking why the alarm was going off. The firetruck showed up and the firemen came in and couldn’t put the pullswitch back in place because they didn’t have a key…..so I called around until I got to Seth and he said that it might be in the safe with ALL the other keys. So the firemen and I played scavenger hunt with the keys trying to figure out which one worked. All the while, guests were asking what was wrong and one particular guest was upset and complaining….\r\n    We found the key and I think that it needs to go next to the alarm panel or I wish someone had told me where the “special key” was. I couldn’t find a procedure for the fire alarm in the manual and I wish that had been more organized and less embarrassing. I’m glad the summer is almost over.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make sure to write the guest confirmation number on each spa voucher. Much easier to reconcile that way. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    106\r\n    Experienced a leaking ceiling. We moved the guest (thank you Morgan, for your impeccable moving folks around skills:) and blocked out room until Tuesday. Maintenance report made out.\r\n\r\n    It’s buuuuuusssssyyyyyyy! Thank you all for hanging in there and being fabulous!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 1:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, I spoke to Kevin over at San Juan Outfitters and they requested that we let guests know that for the Sunset Tour there is NO RETURN TRIP ON THE VAN. It is after-hours for them and there is no one left to drive the vans so they’ve been calling people taxis and paying for it. Thanks!\r\n    KT\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2011 at 11:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone-it’s Freaky Friday. When Clipper folks are checking in or calling, let’s make sure to get their phone numbers in the reservation. There have been lots of people not checking out on time, leaving belongings etc…..;) Have a great weekend!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2011 at 4:10 pm\r\n\r\n    This is just a test…\r\n    Are we working?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew…\r\n    - Victoria/San Juan Cruises group is in with only a few hiccups. Last minute switching due to ground floor requirements and all that. However there was one issue we all can learn from. If you move around any rooms attached to a group that is having a remote check-in. Make extra sure you update the rooming list and change any keys that have already been made. Had some guests walk in on people already in the room because the rooming list said they were in that room.\r\n    - 117 will be looking for a ride to the ferry at around 9am to catch the Sydney boat. Please try to accommodate them.\r\n    - A message has been left with Inter-Island Water to replace our water bottles. We are on our last one.\r\n    - We are getting low on AAA and AA batteries. Do we buy them in town or order bulk?\r\n    - There are a stack of keys by the mail-out box for BR. Door keys that went bad and have been reprogrammed.\r\n    - Our champagne is in at the Market Chef. A check needs to be made out and someone needs to go pick it up.\r\n    - We needed to use our emergency hold rooms for the night of the 6th. I managed to block out 314 but try to block out a different room type if one comes open and release 314 if you can.\r\n\r\n    Well, I will be hitting Ikea tomorrow morning. Give me a call if anyone wants anything. Remember, I do drive a Mini, so that EXPIDIT bookcase you’ve had your eye on probably will not fit in my trunk no matter how “flat-pak’d” it is. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2011 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    The pricing in the computer for when guest want to add a kayak or a whale watch trip, is priced for San Juan Island Outfitters and San Juan Safaris. Make sure that you use them for those specific reservations and again they are our 1st tear of booking company’s for those adventures..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2011 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    LEGGINGS AND CHARGER\r\n    Some time ago there was a bag in my office with some stuff a guest left with a note they would come back this summer to pick it up. They called today. Anybody knows what happened to the bag?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2011 at 11:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew, a ton of calls and people walking it right when I am closing.\r\n    -111 was a no show at closing. Called twice.\r\n    -Several people were wanting to leave bags bright and early before we opened. I told them that if, by chance the office is not open in time for them to leave their bags, they could set them with the coffee shop. (sorry Courtney) I left a bundle of luggage tags for C just in case.\r\n    -Best of luck in the morning I hope everything goes smoothly. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2011 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    LADIES & GENTLEMEN!\r\n    The Department of Energy is refilled! Help yourself and keep it coming!\r\n    Love ya!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2011 at 7:01 pm\r\n\r\n    PETS woof woof\r\n    I noticed that some of us are not having guests fill out pet registration forms when guests with pets check in. There are in the lower drawer of the back desk. Have guest fill out registration form. Give guest our pet policies and write pet name on it. And of course give pet a doggie bone.\r\n\r\n    CHECK EM IN\r\n    Please make sure to mark guests as “checked in” after you swipe their cards. Seems so obvious, but is easy to forget.\r\n\r\n    SWITCHING ROOMS\r\n    Uh, so many ways to mess up. So say a guest tags on another night and you go to “c” and do that and there is a room open and all seems good, please make sure that WRP didn’t assign them another room. Make sure they are in the same room they were in already. If that same room is not available, you may look on the availability page and see if you can move the guest, who is scheduled to check into that room after the guest in question. If you forget to do that then you end up with guests in rooms which are marked clean in WRP and oh boy, oh boy, we don’t want to go there…..\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2011 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT BOXES\r\n    I went through the list that we were given for the Potts/Rose Wedding gift boxes and it is not entirely accurate. The bride is aware of this and she asked that if they say they are with the wedding then give them a box. There are a couple reservations that needed more than one box, in which case it is written in their reservation notes. A couple of guests also checked in yesterday, we are working on getting their boxes too them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    DISCOUNTS\r\n    Please please please no discounts this time of the year (well, not on weekends anyway, you can give a leeetle bit off for a late night walk in). Charge for every futon, every crib, every dog and most importantly for every extra person ($10 for everybody over 12). This is it, guys, we just have those 2 months. Let’s rock it!\r\n\r\n    #3394176\r\n    Please everybody read notes on this reservation.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    I know we are busy, but please try to hack away at those alarms (hard to do at night, with everybody gone home), it’s getting to the point where it looks overwhelming. Thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. It shows!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 2:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    The Potts/ Rose wedding is this weekend with most check ins coming in tomorrow. We have gift boxes for each room (not each individual) in the luggage room. They asked to give them to the guests at check in. The list is on the back desk, I’ll write in the reservation notes tomorrow to remind us upon check in during my office hours.\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2011 at 11:19 am\r\n\r\n    EXCITING NEW THINGS:::\r\n    Roma Ogle is going to begin some Basic Boot Camp training classes in our conference room, If you are interested in starting the boot camp work out sessions, the following dates are mandatory to learn the beginning moves:\r\n\r\n    August 9, 2011 at 5:30pm and August 13, 2011 at 10:00am.. These classes will be held in the conference center at EB…\r\n    (I think you are only asked to attend one to get the information, but you can attend both, Roma will bring me a flyer and I will post here at EB)\r\n\r\n    Once these classes get up and going, we will have a sign up sheet for guest that want to drop in to the ongoing classes..\r\n\r\n    BIKE COVERS\r\n\r\n    Everyone working the closing shift has to make sure to cover the bikes with our new fancy and spendy bike covers.. I would like the bike covers put on at night RAIN OR SHINE…these nice covers will keep our cute little bikes from getting so rusty so quick.\r\n\r\n    Coffee shop openers may take the covers off in the morning, unless it is pouring down rain, then you may keep them on until the rain has subsided..Please store them in the bins that Seth has bought inside the pool fence..\r\n\r\n    Thanks ALL… I look forward to seeing you at Basic Training BOOT CAMP….:)\r\n\r\n    Thank you for doing this everyone.. :)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2011 at 12:44 pm\r\n\r\n    there is a bees nest by room #105, and the guests staying for six days in room number #340 said that the bathtub is draining really really slow. maintenance forms filled out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2011 at 11:00 pm\r\n\r\n    More news.\r\n\r\n    There is a young man from Turkey who really really really wants to go fishing. They are only here for one night so we have left messages with North Shore Charters to see if they can take them out on Tuesday. Please let them know if you hear anything. Res #3410009\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2011 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All!\r\n\r\n    The large wedding party called and cancelled/released several rooms held for them this Saturday the 23rd. So we now have some rooms open. I blocked out several for emergency hold because I just know, that we’ll get a wedding party member showing up expecting a room held for them that we don’t have. :\\ But otherwise, we now have some open rooms to sell. Woot!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2011 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    MY K-GIRLS:) KHAI AND KATIE\r\n    Can you please let me know when you will leave for the season? I vaguely know mid August, but when?\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Courtney Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2011 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone!\r\n\r\n    First time blogging – pretty cool :) . But anyways, I just wanted to let y’all know that this Saturday, July 16th, The Place has a classical guitarist playing that night. So we can let our guests know about that!\r\n\r\n    Have an AMAZZZZZZING day everyone! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2011 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    PATIO UMBRELLA LIGHTS\r\n    Will you please turn them on each night? It’ll look so inviting and cute.\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK OUTS AND EARLY ARRIVALS\r\n    T’is the season. Please spare Raquel’s sanity and o.k. the latest checkouts for 11:30 only. Also, on super busy days, please don’t call her and ask if a room is ready. If it’s not clean in the system, let our guests know we’ll get an update around 1:00PM and the rooms are guaranteed to be ready at 3:00PM. Offer to store their luggage, check out bikes, use the pool, whatever helps.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2011 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello my peeps. We need some moolah in the front desk drawer. Have a fantabulous day!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2011 at 11:15 am\r\n\r\n    Reminder……………\r\n\r\n    Kayaking Trips\r\n    Whale Watch Trips\r\n\r\n    All vendors for kayaking and whale watching have a cancellation policy, IF you make a reservation and cancel it after the cancellation time (PLEASE SEE SPECIFICS BELOW) WE WILL BE CHARGED……\r\n    So make sure your guests know what the policy is before booking a trip for them..\r\n    Cancellation Policy:\r\n    1-4 People 48 hrs\r\n    5-9 People 14 days\r\n    10 or more, please inquire\r\n    If you cancel within the above times and do not charge the guest accordingly you may be responsible for the fee we are charged.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for all your are doing this season, we do have an awesome crew and I thank you for all your are doing… :)\r\n    Please let me know if you have any questions..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2011 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    A couple things:\r\n\r\n    I ran across 2 different side by side deep tissue massages for that were only charged $170, and it should have been $190.00. Please make sure that when you book a massage you put in the right amount.\r\n    Also, when making a massage voucher, make sure that the guest reservation number in on the gift certificate.\r\n    Evening shift\r\n    Please make sure when it gets dusk out, you go out and turn on the umbrella lights in the pool patio and turn the heater on if a guest request it. You may shut the lights and the propane heaters off before you leave at night.. (don’t forget to shut the bottle of propane completely off)\r\n    There was a little boy that was hanging off the concrete stairs going up to the conference room, he was on the other side of the railing, a piece of the concrete broke and he let go and landed down below. He is okay, accident report has been written and pictures have been taken. I have a call into John Steven’s to have a quote for repair some of our cracked stairs, if he comes in and I am not here, call Seth..\r\n    Keep up all your wonderful work… Morgan I hope your vacation is going AWESOME…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2011 at 4:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Clock is not fixed. SJ Jeweler took it back and will let us know when it’s truly fixed. Probably on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2011 at 1:21 pm\r\n\r\n    $$$$$\r\n    Please count the till every night and drop money.\r\n\r\n    ZIA GIRLS\r\n    Please indicate on your drop if the money you have taken has been put into WRP or not.\r\n\r\n    FD CLOCK\r\n    Is fixed. Thanks SJ Jeweler.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 6:02 pm\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY 7/15\r\n    Guys, we have a huge group staying on Saturday, 7/16 only, so we have all these rooms for Friday 7/15, but when folks go online it tells them there is a 2 night minimum. Whenever someone calls for a Friday 7/15 reservation, please sell a room for one night to them.\r\n    Also: in general once the weekend is here and we still have rooms unsold, feel free to sell for only one night. Go to the availability calendar and see which room is only available for one night and sell, sell, sell!\r\n\r\n    INNLINK CANCELLATIONS\r\n    Just a reminder: if a guest calls to cancel an innlink reservation, please let them know that they have to call their travel agency directly. We can’t cancel innlink reservations (I mean we can, but then we still get charged by the travel agency and we don’t want that:)\r\n\r\n    Have a rocking weekend everybody!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 11:34 am\r\n\r\n    One more thing!\r\n    Lets make sure we all set the rooms as clean at three. If we don’t it makes the next days housekeeping report inaccurate. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    Guess what I located the bike helmet clips… They will be shipped out on Monday and should arrive next week some time.\r\n    I called the company directly.. :)\r\n    All the helmets that are on the floor next to the refrigerator are not in working order.. The ones that are should be hanging up..\r\n    :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2011 at 9:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Just a couple of little things\r\n\r\n    On busy weekends the latest check out we can offer is 11:30, otherwise housekeeping gets backed up. Housekeeping also requests that we do not call them to check to see if rooms are ready. They will update us when they are.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately we cannot keep doggies (or any other pet for that matter) in the lobby without the owner present. Apparently we had an escape artist of a dog in the lobby on the 4th.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, are we still thinking about doing a Cafe Zia meeting? I think we need to figure out a better way to keep track of how much we are making daily, etc.\r\n\r\n    Enjoy the sunshine everyone!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2011 at 6:01 pm\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    Came and went, we have all the keys we need now. Office and BR keys are here at EB. Come and pick them up from me if you need:)\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Very important guys: you need to attach Clipper reservations to the corporate account. If you don’t, the price shows up and all hell breaks lose. Please please do it!\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2011 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    Just a couple things:\r\n\r\n    - Please let housekeeping know that 338 will need to be cleaned. The guests in there moved to another room.\r\n\r\n    - Kyle the locksmith will be coming by either on Wednesday or Thursday to make some keys. We need probably at least 5-Lobby door keys, 5-sets of Bird Rock Masters/Kitchen door keys, and most importantly, 3-4 keys for the Orcas Room at BR. They are down to just one key. BR should have a master Orcas key if the one room key is checked out. Take a look around and see if we are missing keys for anything else. I know Khai needs a new front desk key and Katie’s BR master has never worked. In fact my BR master needs to be trimmed because it barely works in some doors down there. :)\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2011 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    307\r\n    Angela & Stevie: we managed to put a room on emergency hold for tonight: 307. Release after all your check-ins are here or around 7:00PM whatever occurs first.\r\n\r\n    # 2892449\r\n    This is the reservation folks made for 2012 for a sea place for July 22/23. I know that they meant to come this year because they are part of a wedding. We are sold out for that weekend. I managed to close out 309. Left msg with guest. When they call, please offer them the earth place. Ask Cindy, Morgan or I if you have trouble changing the reservation.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    EMPLOYEE FRIDGE\r\n    Is smelly and lot’s of stuff in there looks a tad abandoned. Let’s do the following from now on:\r\n    If you leave something in the fridge overnight, write your name on it. If it’s up for grabs, write: “eat me” on it.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS SOME MORE\r\n    So arrival date on each alarm AND if a guest selected “call me” in one of our add-on options, please call once, write note about call in remarks section, turn alarm off. Only if a guest booked an add-on (as in: something has been added to their invoice) will we call and leave the alarm on and call again and again until we reach the guest.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2011 at 10:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All!\r\n\r\n    Just want to remind everyone (including me) to be extra vigilant on Sunday. Due to fixing the mishaps that happened on Friday and Saturday, we do not have any Emergency Hold rooms to fall back on for Sunday. So avoid moving rooms around if at all possible and make sure you double check those keys so nobody gets lost in a shuffle. Let’s rock this thing!\r\n\r\n    PS. The nice lady in 336 will be by to get the motorized wheelchair in the morning. She needed someplace to charge it and it’s too heavy to drag up the steps to the room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2011 at 2:19 pm\r\n\r\n    WIRELESS\r\n    The wireless router serving Bld A, the Wind Place and maybe the Sea Places is down, phone line dead, Centurylink will be here on 7/5. Please let our guests know upon check in. Offer to hang out with us in the lobby or go to pool patio. Offer small discount if necessary.\r\n    Morgan, there is a super slim chance that Centurylink comes out today. If they do, Chris left his Road Scholar office key on my desk for you to give to them. make sure you get it back and give it back to Chris.\r\n\r\n    MISHAPS\r\n    First big weekend, some mishaps, let’s review:\r\n    Always repeat to a guest what room style you just reserved for them, be clear about bed configuration (say :”single King” rather than “Sky”).\r\n    When moving guests to a different room, double triple check that you saved those changes, look at it again, then make keys.\r\n    When making a reservation make sure you are in the correct YEAR, yup.\r\n    I know it’s busy and stressful right now, please pay attention. Review your bookings before you leave for the day (go to “recent bookings” in the “report” section”).\r\n\r\n    2012\r\n    And after above mishap I looked at 2012 booking and found 2 online reservations made for 2012. I’m 99% sure they meant to be here this year. left msg with guests. Try to accommodate them. As I said these were online reservations and not our mistake, but still, we should have caught this and didn’t. So look at the year when you get online reservations. Uiiieee!\r\n    Together we can do this!\r\n    Enjoy the sun!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2011 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please don’t forget to put arrival dates on every alarm.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Please make sure you double check to see if our guests requested a massage, whale watch tour or kayak trip when making an online reservation. We missed several recently.\r\n\r\n    CHECK UPCOMING RESERVATIONS\r\n    Which brings me to: whenever you have a second, please go through today’s check-ins and upcoming check-ns, just to make sure we didn’t miss anything (an add-n, a request for a specific room, an unanswered question, etc.)\r\n\r\n    THIS WEEKEND\r\n    Go ahead and sell single night stays for today and tomorrow. We still have a couple of rooms left and everything must go!\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    What did you find out about the bike helmet clasps? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    YOU ARE THE VERY BESTEST! OMG, we had such a big issue with a 3 night stay who needed an Earth Place, but were in a Sky and Morgan switched and finagled and moved and called other guests and he just did it, solved the issue. Thank you so much!\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th of July weekend, everybody! You rock!\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2011 at 10:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    The left front desk computer currently isn’t printing. Called Chris, waiting to hear back from him.\r\n    have a wonderful day!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2011 at 2:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Not only did we get new water dispensers (1) for the lobby and (1) for the conference room, but we also just got (2) new patio heaters.. they are so nice and toasty.. My thought is that they will stay unlit on the pool patio, if a guest requests for them to be turned on, please assist them, there are directions on the outside of the heater if you want to try it on your own, just remember, you have to turn the tank on in the bottom of the heater first.. If someone wants to move one over to the front of building E… NO PROBLEM.. Just make sure it is turned off and wheel it on over..\r\n    BUT……\r\n    The evening person MUST make sure that all heaters are turned off, and that the tank on the bottom is shut off. If a heater has been moved over to the front of building E, it must be moved over inside the pool patio..\r\n    Any questions?? I am happy to help.. Also, let our guest know they may use these, I am also going to have Dylan put some new umbrella lights up in the umbrella’s in the pool patio, my hope is that it will feel like a welcome place to come and hang out in the evenings.\r\n    Here comes the 4th… I am so excited.. Enjoy…\r\n    kathy Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone, We have a new water dispenser in the lobby. Cindy wanted us to all be aware that the instructions are in the lower part/inside of the tank and that the power must be off before changing bottle. Drink your water.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, just letting you know that we might be receiving a credit card authorization from a lady in Eastern Europe so that her son may use her card number to pay for a night or two. His name is Milosh(sp?). He will probably be checking in from time to time to see if we have received the fax. We can’t rent him a room without it. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2011 at 6:58 pm\r\n\r\n    SNEAK AWAY SPECIAL\r\n    So our sneak away special has a flaw. Duck Soup is not open on Mondays and Tuesdays (in June, will only be closed Mondays in July). I’m waiting to hear from Cindy and Laura on how to proceed. For now, I offered the reservations we have on the books already the COHO as an alternative (they are open, yeah!)\r\n\r\n    STATE PARK PASS\r\n    From now on when you park your car at a state park (lime kiln) you’ll need a pass, $10 per day, $30 per season. Passes are available at Ace and Kings. Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    FD PRINTER\r\n    We currently can’t print from the right (our right) FD computer. It asks for a password I don’t have. I left a message with Chris. Please call him again tomorrow if you haven’t heard from him.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2011 at 4:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys, we sent out a newsletter last week and I failed to blog about the special so here it is: If a guest calls and asks for the SNEAK AWAY SPECIAL, which includes a FREE $50 DINING CREDIT when they book a 2 night stay between now and June 30, 2011, just enter the promo/password: SNEAKAWAY and make a voucher for a $50 dining certificate to Duck Soup for them (and offer to make a reservation for dinner at the same time).\r\n    KT Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2011 at 1:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, I apologize for bringing my friend’s dog to Birdrock the other day. That was highly irresponsible of me and I am offering to vacuum/sweep/mop the floors if that will make up for it. Sorry Regino for irritating your allergies. It will never EVER happen again.\r\n    ANGELA Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2011 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi–thank you so much for the reminder on the Clipper reservations! I personally have trouble remembering all that needs to happen with those. :-)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2011 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Please order 5# of coffee from San Juan Coffee Co tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    I double checked some Clipper reservations which had been checked twice already (?!) and found the following:\r\n    Several reservations weren’t linked to the clipper corporate account. That’s important, that’s what suppresses the pricing.\r\n    Several canceled reservations weren’t put back into inventory, as in a room wasn’t closed out again after a reservation was canceled. That’s also important. We got a Clipper in block reservation today, but we didn’t have any rooms. I figured it out, but please close out rooms in case of a cancellation.\r\n\r\n    MOVING GUESTS\r\n    When you move a guest to a different room and HK is gone (if they aren’t, please call them right away). Please close out the room to be cleaned the next day, but also: leave a huge note for Raquel on the back desk AND blog about it. We checked somebody into a dirty room last night, because it wasn’t communicated that that room is dirty.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. You rock!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2011 at 8:21 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    In case you weren’t aware… CAFE ZIA IS OPEN! Let the guests know we’re out here, Wednesday through Sunday 7:00am-11:00am. I like to tell the guest upon check in when we are showing them around the property map :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2011 at 12:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder about the whale watch delight special, we do not get commission for the one free trip that is included in the room rate. For example, if a guest books the whale watch delight special and wants a whale watch for two adults, we will only get %5 of the second persons whale watch trip. Make sense? :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2011 at 9:23 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK SOME MORE\r\n    Innlink reservations where we don’t charge the guest but rather a travel agent credit card upon check out, we need to suppress the pricing on those. Very important!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2011 at 1:26 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please put all purple bikes on one rack and all orange bikes on the other.\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    Is broken again. Cindy will call the repair people and keep us posted.\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    One of the guest washers is out of order. The quarter slot thingy is stuck. Seth will have a look.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER ABOVE BLOCK\r\n    Clipper reservations above block will get the same rate as Clipper reservations in block, but we reserve the right to not sell rooms above block on holiday weekends or if we are almost sold out.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for doing a great job. The season is here, uuuuiiiieeeeeehhhhhh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    CHOCOLATES\r\n    From now on we don’t order chocolates from San Juan Florist or Robin’s Nest anymore. We order them directly from SJ Coffee Co 1-800-624-4119. Ask for the romance package chocolate assortment. They may be able to deliver sometimes, but mostly we will have to pick them up. They made us a nice packages which looks good and consists of high quality chocolates.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 11:25 am\r\n\r\n    New Special is up:\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHER’S DELIGHT! Read all about it on the specials page, but here’s the scoop: Guests who call and say WHALE or book online using that code and stay with us for at least two nights in June arriving on Sunday through Thursday nights will get one free whale watching trip. That’s only one person per reservation. If you have any questions, ask me or Steffi.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2011 at 9:24 am\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Will open on June 15 and will be open daily through Labor Day from 6:30AM to 11:30AM.\r\n    Stevie, Khaili and Tory: there is a training with Cafe Del Arte scheduled for you guys on Monday, June 13. We don’t have a time yet. Laura or Cindy will let you know when that is. Please come!\r\n    We think what we’ll do this season is have the coffee shop person check out beach cruisers during their open hours. So we’ll need beach Cruiser release forms, paper clips and a couple of folders out there, and the bike lock and helmets. And you’ll need to let the guests know that they can pick up their credit cards at the front desk after the coffee shop closes.\r\n    Sound good? Make it so!!!!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Please email schedule requests to me or put them in my box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    INN LINK\r\n    Grrrrr. So: if we get an innlink reservation, please check the guest name against the name on the credit card. If it’s the same, take 10% deposit and confirm reservation. charge guest’s card upon check in, just as always.\r\n    If the guest’s credit card doesn’t match the name on the reservation, check on the innlink website (see Laura’s blog below)if it’s a travelocity booking. They have this deal where they charge the guest, then play with their money until the reservation is, then we charge their (travelocity’s) credit card when the guest checks out.\r\n    For those:\r\n    confirm reservation without taking any money, write superbig “TRAVELOCITY” in the remark section of WRP. Then, when the guest checks in, take the guest’s cc number and put it in the remark section as well (not in the credit card section). DON’T erase the travelocity cc on file.\r\n    Charge travelocity cc upon guest check out.\r\n    We just need to make extra sure to NOT charge the guest cc, because they have paid already and that just wouldn’t be good.\r\n    Questions? Ask one of your lovely boss ladies.\r\n\r\n    Have a great week everybody. Thank you for all your hard work.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2011 at 7:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that 301 is dirty for Saturday June 5th. The guests in it moved to a larger room.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2011 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hiya Everyone!\r\n    So we have a new computer system. We are now Mac people!! Chris is setting the computers up so that they turn on at 7:30am and off at 11:30pm all by themselves!! I also typed up a little cheat sheet on how to do some of the everyday stuff. Also feel free to ask me any questions about the new system.\r\n\r\n    :D\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 1st, 2011 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW WEBSITE\r\n\r\n    Check it out! Our new website is up! We’re still working on the photos, but the content is all there. We’ve worked really hard on it and it should be a good resource for our guests. I would really like for each of you to look it over thoroughly and let me know if yup have any corrections…or compliments ;-) .\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2011 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Raquel wanted me to let the front desk know if there ever comes a time when there are no pool towels in the pool house or the housekeeping laundry she has a stash in the orca room for backup.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2011 at 9:54 am\r\n\r\n    We are missing:\r\n    the hole puncher for gift certificates and the lighter for the candles. Anybody?\r\n\r\n    Crib got returned safely.\r\n\r\n    Ordered hot coco and 1/2 & 1/2 for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    Please bring the insane amount of left behind items to Post San Juan tomorrow. Please note the i-phone charger owner would like to have a quote first before we ship it. It may be cheaper to just get a new charger.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2011 at 12:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Another FYI:\r\n    I’ve rented a crib to a couple who are up visiting their parents who live on the island. They had extra family show up and they didn’t have enough baby-friendly sleeping areas to go around. I made a copy of his credit card and his drivers license. I put it under the cash organizer in the cash drawer. They will be returning it on Monday. Let me know if you have any questions. This is Morgan by the way. For some reason it won’t let me post a comment unless I say I’m Steffi. Weird.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2011 at 11:38 am\r\n\r\n    HI ALL!!\r\n\r\n    Just another friendly reminder that we need to make sure we are charging for extra persons in rooms, especially down at Bird Rock. Children are anyone under 4 at BR, under 13 at EB. And remember it’s $20 per night for extra people at BR and $10 at EB. Also please be aware of what rooms you can let folks pack extra people in. Water Places are for 2 adults and *maybe* in a pinch, a small child. We also don’t usually allow roll-aways or futons in those rooms either. They are just too small. This goes for the Cypress, Matia, Patos, Shaw, Skipjack, & Succia as well. So always keep in mind room occupancy limits when booking folks. Always try to get the number of people that will be in the room before you quote them prices. Thank You!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2011 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Ang,\r\n    we do put a little doggie blanket, food and water bowl, doggie towel and treat in the pet rooms before our pet guests check in. At least we planned to. Did a guest say something to the contrary?\r\n\r\n    Guys, I’m sick and will take tomorrow off. Thank you so much Tory and Myah for helping me out (0×0x0×0x0x). Please call me at home if you need help with anything.\r\n\r\n    What a great weekend, sunny, busy and we have such a great team. Yeah!!!!!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2011 at 8:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest Suggestion:\r\n\r\n    With our pet fee maybe we could provide doggie amenities such as dog bowls, bed, etc.\r\n\r\n    1-800 Number:\r\n\r\n    I’ve had several calls tonight on the 800 line and each call had long delay and garbled voice. When the guest calls back on the 360 line all is fine.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2011 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n    Just FYI that the lost and found forms and the commission sheets have been moved to the filing cabinet under the fax/printer/copier.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 9:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Angie, who does all the cooking for Road Scholar has asked that we not book Rm 307, unless it’s the only 1 left, between May 31-June 4. She has been getting in at 330am and trying to tip-toe around, but she still makes noise and doesn’t want to disturb anyone below. Thank you.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 12:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again!\r\n    I called Town Graphics and we should be getting our 2011 San Juan Island Maps in this weekend! I asked for multiple boxes!\r\n    (:\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2011 at 11:04 am\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone!\r\n    Okay so we had ANOTHER key card update! Your key cards that you have now may or may not work. Silly, I know… But if that is the case and your card does not work, please let Cindy know and she will make you a new one. Lets hope this is the last time!! Thanks for all of your cooperation guys!\r\n\r\n    Also, Guest who where checked in prior to the update may need to have a new key made. If that is the case just make a new key card and they should be good to go! (:\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2011 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPLASH UPDATE!\r\n\r\n    I just changed the spring splash special.\r\n\r\n    I’ve extended it through this weekend, it’s only valid on Earth Places and the rates are different. Check it out on our specials page: http://www.earthboxmotel.com/specials-packages/\r\n\r\n    INNLINK BOOKINGS:\r\n\r\n    I’ve now set it up so that you guys can take a look at the Innlink website and see the upcoming reservations. Sometimes you’ll be able to see which website it was originally booked through (i.e. Travelocity, Orbitz, etc.) so that you can get some idea how to process it. Steffi or I will show you how to go online to check these and will get you a cheat sheet so that you will know how to process them. Stay tuned…\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 4:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone!\r\n    We have NEW KEY CARDS!! If you have not gotten one yet they are in the cash drawer. (:\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    SELL THIS WEEKEND\r\n    Hi guys, we still have lots of availability for this weekend, so I took out the 2-night minimum for Saturday for our regularly priced rooms. Our discounted rates still will require a 2-night minimum. Sell. Sell. Sell.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2011 at 10:54 am\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    is working fine according to our fill in IT guy.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please don’t forget to put an arrival date in every alarm you create in WRP.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2011 at 9:26 am\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Wifi in Building A is not working. Please let our guests know. Offer to move them or to connect here in the lobby.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BOOZE\r\n    San Juan Island Distillery (Westcott Bay cider) is having their grand opening next weekend. Us hotel folks are invited next Friday from 3:00PM to 5:00PM out on Westcott Bay. Who wants to go?\r\n    We got some rack cards for them, distillery and cidery tours every Saturday 3:00PM to 5:00PM. This is a cool tourist attraction. Make sure to include it in your island tour spiel.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2011 at 2:56 pm\r\n\r\n    TOMORROW BIKE GROUP\r\n    The bike group which is staying here has their bikes stored in the maintenance shed. They can’t access that. They will go on a ride to Roche Harbor tomorrow, mid morning. Please have Regino open the maintenance shed for them when they would like to go.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please don’t forget to double check that the beach cruisers are locked up every night.\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Everybody needs new all access keys AGAIN. Don’t ask:) Just have Morgan, Cindy or I make you a new key the next time you work.\r\n\r\n    TORY & STEVIE 5/24 GROUP\r\n    On 5/24 Victoria San Juan Cruises will be staying with us. Seth will do luggage handling. For this one stay we will give them a ride into town that evening to take them to dinner (some of those guests are unable to walk, they used to go to Jimmy’s, the new Jimmy’s is not open for that date yet). So, Tory or Stevie you will need to take them downtown when they would like to go to dinner and pick them back up. We’ll need a copy of your driver’s license (please put in Cindy’s box) so we can put you on the van insurance. Please let us know before that date if you want a van lesson.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2011 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS SPECIALS SPECIALS\r\n    I made a specials cheat sheet with all our ongoing specials on it. A longer version can be found in the front desk manual. A quick reference sheet can be found on each of our computers.\r\n    Rock on!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2011 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST PHONES\r\n    Remember the memo you all initialed on 4/15. We really meant it. Please let Cindy or I know if below is not clear to you:\r\n    Remember when guests called to say their message light is blinking and there was nothing we could do about it? It’s fixed, yeah!\r\n    What we need to do is check guests in and out in the phone system every day. This might seem tedious at first, but it will be easier in the long run.\r\n    Every morning print out your check-outs for the day and around 11 go to the back desk phone (not the phone console, the actual phone), hit the “check in/out” button and follow the instructions.\r\n    After every ferry rush check our guests in in the phone system by using the same button and following the instruction, then file the invoices away (put in white box in bathroom), so we only have in our drawer the invoices of recent guests which need to be checked into the phone system. The reason being, we can’t clear message, messages clear automatically when we check in another guest.\r\n    I know this must sound overwhelming. It’s really no big deal. Have us show you. Please ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER PART VCXXXXXXCVCXIIIII\r\n    Showtime: first Clipper guest will arrive on May 21. We started today to print out upcoming Clipper reservations from the Clipper website:\r\n    AM shift:\r\n    1) Go to the Clipper website and sign in\r\n    2) go to “view bookings”\r\n    3) click on “arrival date”, select today through seven days from today, print\r\n    4) note which reservations have been cancelled, which are active\r\n    5) Look up all reservations on WRP, make sure everything is correct, the active ones are active, the cancelled ones are cancelled. Make changes as necessary.\r\n    6) Look up “unit closeouts” in WRP, release all rooms for that week which haven’t been released yet.\r\n    7) Date and initial, put in back desk basket to be double checked.\r\n    PM shift:\r\n    Take report from back desk, repeat steps 5-7, date, initial and file in Clipper file (under printer in my office).\r\n    Any questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    CLOSED SIGN\r\n    Please put the closed sign for the lobby door UNDER the chair as opposed to behind it. It scratches up the wall behind the chair.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you. Have a great week everybody. Call me if you need me:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2011 at 11:09 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Angela for handling the power outage notifications so well:)\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR EARLY ARRIVAL/STAYOVER\r\n    It’s not necessary to have our road scholar guests who are staying longer to check in with us twice. Just make their key for the entire stay.\r\n\r\n    INNLINK\r\n    When you process in innlink reservation, please make sure to go into the edit screen after charging the guest’s card, and change the guest status to “confirmed”, select “innlink” as the source code and select their credit card type (if you don’t it will say invalid credit card, which isn’t true). Please don’t forget to take this step or WRP won’t assign a room to the reservation.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2011 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY 5/26 PLANNED POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Opalco is having a planned power outage on Thursday 5/26 from 11:45PM to 4:00AM. Kathy or Angela, will you please call the guests staying with us that night, explain the situation and offer to move their reservation if this is unacceptable to them? It’s island wide.\r\n    If you make a reservation for anybody staying that night, please mention the power outage. Nobody should have any issue with that if they know up front and why.\r\n    On that day, we’ll need to get flashlights for our guests upon check in. Maybe we should make a sign for the front desk as well.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 5:17 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL USAGE\r\n    Hello all! This is just a reminder that the spa has a deal set up with us that their guests can pay $5 to use our pool before/after their treatment. The pool use can only be done on the day of their treatment and you need to call the spa to confirm that they do actually have a treatment to let them in. Just ring it up as a point of sale purchase. Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We will not sell rooms to the Victoria Clipper above block (that’s when they call us as opposed to emailing us)during July 2, 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n    DUCK SOUP\r\n    Is now also on our voucher program, so for Romance package dining vouchers we can offer COHO, The Place and Duck Soup Inn.\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    We will not provide room service anymore. All references to it have been taken from the website. I took most references out of the guest directories (which we will re-do very soon). For now if somebody inquires about it, please say we are phasing that out, but please accommodate the guest and do room service until we will have the new guest directories.\r\n\r\n    GUEST INJURY\r\n    If a guest gets injured on our property or on our bikes we NEED to have an incident report filled out by the guest.\r\n    Always be passionate, never admit to any fault on our part (as in:”Yeah, those stairs, we all trip over them all the time”), offer to call a doctor.\r\n    The incident reports are in the upper file cabinet under the printer in my office.\r\n    And: never give out drugs. We are legally not allowed to dispense any drugs, not even Tylenol or Aspirin.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2011 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    The moped is back… This is for advertising for Susie’s Moped’s SO, if someone comes in side to inquire about it, sell them a voucher for Susie’s..\r\n    ALSO this moped will need to be moved into the pool gate EVERY night and moved outside the gate EVERY morning..\r\n    Thanks..\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2011 at 12:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n    We have a gust who has lost their wallet. If you happen to find it he is conf. # 3124780 and to just call the number on file. Thank you so much!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2011 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    BECAUSE I’M TRYING TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY…\r\n\r\n    I have uploaded two more specials. But these each require a password for the guest to access (and remember if you are given the password, you can just enter it into the booking form and you should just see that price).\r\n\r\n    HARBORS: This entitles people who are members of the Harbors Travel Club to get 10% off, regular rate only, subject to availability, i.e. not on holidays, not combinable with other discounts or specials. They must show their Harbors Travel Club card on check in to get this rate.\r\n\r\n    TRIPSTER: An all new kind of special. For guests booking a minimum of two nights, they will get a free (to them) $50 dining credit. They must STAY between now and June 30th and AT LEAST 2 nights. IMPORTANT! Remember to make a dining voucher for them of $50 to Duck Soup restaurant. File this the same way you would any other gift certificate or voucher.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2011 at 9:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPLASH – New and Improved…\r\n\r\n    Read the new special details on our Specials page. Make note, it is similar to the previous special EXCEPT, it is only good on Sundays through Thursdays. Questions? Don’t be shy about asking.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2011 at 4:14 pm\r\n\r\n    A few things :)\r\n    Porsche Club will be returning the August, please take a moment to look at their group info. Take a look at the billing information and the 2 day min..\r\n    Victoria Clipper\r\n    You may notice that their rates are a few cents off on their email confirmations, don’t worry about what that says, what I have in our WRP system is the correct rate.\r\n    New Time Clock\r\n    Yahhoo , we have received new time clocks.. I am excited, you probable won’t notice the difference except for BR will actually have a clock you can use, but when I get it all up and running, please take note that you will all have new swiper cards, you don’t actually swipe these, you wave them in front of the clock.. I will be putting up instructions on how you clock in at the different hotels and departments so watch for the notice..\r\n    Thanks everyone for coming to the party.. It was fun and the food of course was awesome..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2011 at 2:31 pm\r\n\r\n    MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\r\n    Please don’t take any more Saturday night only reservation for memorial day weekend. We instituted a 2 night minimum stay. Can’t do it on WRP today though, because WRP is down. Grrrrrr.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2011 at 7:20 pm\r\n\r\n    TWO NIGHT MINIMUM STAY\r\n    Just a reminder: in July and August we require a two night minimum stay on the weekends. On the day of, if you have a walk-in you may sell a room for just one night.\r\n\r\n    HAGGLING\r\n    You are not only allowed, but also encouraged to cut deals with people in order to get them to stay here, especially midweek or when we aren’t sold out, BUT be very careful how you present the price. ALWAYS start with our rack rate, then if you get resistance offer a 10% discount for example, BUT make sure you say something along the line of:” We don’t officially have a military discount, but if you make the reservation with me right now, I’ll give you a 10 % discount.” Then if the guest needs to discuss it with their travel partner and says he will call us back, please tell him your name, how long you will be there and when you will be back and that they should call YOU back. This way we can avoid scenes like: “That will be $227 per night.” “Well, the other girl told me it was $149.”\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. Have a great week!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2011 at 4:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Mother’s Day Frolic:\r\n    This is what the spa is calling their mother’s day special. What it is is $5 off any treatment any mom gets over the Mother’s Day weekend :) Please tell the guests!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2011 at 9:30 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all..\r\n    I know we all like to come into our shift with things in order, so from today on, please do the following and before you leave your shift: lobby vacuumed, counters dusted off, candles in order on counters, (if they are empty, please put a new candle in, I LOVE it when I come in and see that the person on the shift before has all new candles in the extra candle holders in the back ready to go) garbage taken out, (don’t forget about the recycle), pillows in order on the couches and chairs, coffee service stocked, flowers dealt with (dropped leaves on the counter, pick them up, new water needed in the vase, change it out, dead flowers, out they go) The lobby is your responsibility, housekeeping is not in here on a consistent schedule..\r\n    One more thing, please have the candles lite at all times, if the smelly candle bothers you, you don’t have to light that one.\r\n    Thanks everyone.. I appreciate all you do and all the little details that I ask you to do that you do..\r\n    :)\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2011 at 8:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n    I had a lady come in today who stayed with us and thinks she may have left a grey scarf. I didn’t see one but took her info and said I would ask about it. So if anyone has seen one let me know please. Thanks!!\r\n\r\n    Stevie Mae\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2011 at 10:18 am\r\n\r\n    SOCIAL MEDIA:\r\n\r\n    Hi guys, we live in a really strange age where there is less and less separation between our personal lives and our work lives. This is especially true on our little island where we all are friends with each other in addition to being coworkers–a fact that I actually adore. It does, however, has its complications.\r\n\r\n    I can’t and don’t want to control what you post on Facebook or Twitter, etc., even if you post something about not liking your job or tourists or whatever. I certainly hope that you don’t make posts like this because I want all of you to LOVE your job and all of the visitors who come to this island and help us to be able to live here ourselves.\r\n\r\n    BUT, you have to be VERY CAREFUL about making sure that you don’t post anything relating to Guest Privacy or the inner workings of the properties. So please, before you post ANYTHING related to work, think twice.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for listening!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2011 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    May 7, 2011 Saturday 4pm to 6pm\r\n    It is time for our annual Cinco de Mayo Party.. Here at Earthbox motel & spa, out on the pool patio, open to our guests and the public we will be serving yummy authentic Mexican food, have the lovely Mexican dancers and a charming Flamenco Guitarist Ms. Amanda Brast…. Remember to let all guests know that we will be having this..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2011 at 3:50 pm\r\n\r\n    $$$$$$$$$$$\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we have some money missing.\r\n    I really need you to count the till at night, every night, and drop your cash. Please do this!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2011 at 9:18 am\r\n\r\n    What a bummer, Morgan. I’ll keep my eyes out.\r\n\r\n    Oh Angela, what a lovely letter you got from the coast guard guy from Port Angeles. It’s in Laura’s box, check it out. Great job! Thank you so much!\r\n\r\n    We’ll talk about May specials. Right now our bookings look so good that we almost don’t “need” one. We’ll go over the numbers tomorrow and look.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. What a great weekend we had, and with key cards and everything;)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2011 at 11:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello.\r\n    My jacket with my sunglasses in the pocket was taken by a guest while I was closing the pool Saturday night. I had taken it off and set it, rolled up, on the table to do the chemicals. I had my back turned while opening the chem room door and when I came back out and noticed it missing, the guests were gone. Now it may have been an honest mistake because they had a bunch of clothes on the table and may have just grabbed it by accident. They were a heavy-set couple in their 40’s. He had dark hair and a beard. She had reddish-blond hair around shoulder length. They were wearing our robes so they must have been in either Building C or E. If you see anyone matching the description will you please ask them? Hopefully they will return it in the morning when they notice it not theirs. It’s the black Sterns fleece jacket I always wear. The sunglasses have an odd name but they are manufactured by Smith. Thanks.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2011 at 5:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi! Lots of calls for May reservations. Most folks are wondering if we are going to be offering a May Special. Do we know that yet??\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2011 at 2:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All!\r\n\r\n    Just FYI the Spa says it now will cost extra if a guest wants a pre-natal style massage. Also only certain practitioners over there are trained in it so pre-natal massages may not always be available due to scheduling.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2011 at 2:13 am\r\n\r\n    The new key machine is in! Woo! Downside though, we had to reprogram your login password so check with Cindy or Morgan if it isn’t working. Also, you may need a new master card as well.\r\n\r\n    Also just FYI, I pulled a bonehead move and accidentally over-filled the hot tub last night while working on it. This brought the temperature down quite a bit and it may still be reheating when you open. I put the “use if you choose” sign up but I just wanted to make sure you all know in case a guest asks.\r\n\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Key machine did not arrive today :( , I sent an email and left a voice mail at Onity.. Hopefully it will arrive tomorrow.\r\n    If you have key issues, call Seth or I..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 1:54 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered more bottle openers from Island Paper today.\r\n    New key machine is not in yet, but hopefully will be here today..\r\n    Angela got a class schedule for the new XYZ Studio, I have taped it to the white board in the front office.. Let’s go ZUMBA everyone… :)\r\n    Seth is working on the decks in building D, so those rooms are closed out until Friday..\r\n    Happy Wednesday…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2011 at 12:15 pm\r\n\r\n    InnLink customer service:\r\n\r\n    If you have a problem with an InnLink reservation and need to contact the guest directly, you are going to first have to call InnLink at 800-525-5864 to find out who the travel agency is they booked through and get their telephone number.\r\n\r\n    I have found InnLink customer service to be very friendly and they are open 24 hours a day. Please let me know if you have any problems contacting them.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2011 at 10:35 am\r\n\r\n    Keys…\r\n    Super Seth is making keys for the rooms that are being occupied tonight. We now have special keys until we get the new key card machine yesterday… Ask if you have questions..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2011 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    INNLINK RESERVATIONS\r\n\r\n    Very Important: When you process Innlink Reservations, will you please select “Innlink Reservations” for the Market Code. Thanks!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n    Wow today has been quite the day!! Having no key cards is a big pain in the butt, BUT we’ll get through it! (:\r\n\r\n    Laura or Cindy: Should we call tomorrows reservations and ask them if they would like to cancel their reservations or be moved to Bird Rock if possible?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 4:31 pm\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Oh boy, oh boy. When the ferry came, the key maker stopped working for me. Just stopped. Luckily Seth got on the phone with Onity, Raquel led our guests to their rooms. Seth accepted $175 charge from Onity (o.k.ed by me) to help us out. Apparently the whole thingy got erased. They think maybe from a power surge (it’s on a surge suppressor though, mhm). They are reloading our hotel info and then we can make keys again. Yeah!\r\n\r\n    CHECKING GUESTS IN/OUT IN PHONE SYSTEM\r\n    Yep, that started today. Re-read the memo on the white board and do it, please.\r\n\r\n    Have a great week everybody!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2011 at 11:47 am\r\n\r\n    Wednesday UPS – a package is going to be delivered on Wednesday from Global Industries. Please REFUSE SHIPMENT on this package. It is the wrong product.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2011 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    So I don’t post that often, so when I do, you really pay attention right?\r\n\r\n    Details, details, details…It’s all in the details. One of these details is that we want to be a very pet-friendly place. One of the ways that we do this is to treat our four-legged guests as well as we treat our two-legged guests. And, just like we get the names of all our human guests, we should get the names of all our pet guests and write it down so that we can write it on the pet policies form. Please also write the name down in the Housekeeper section because I am instituting a new housekeeper policy regarding pets as well.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2011 at 9:14 am\r\n\r\n    Aaron\r\n    You guys know Aaron, Morgan’s friend? He won a one night stay at Earthbox from Browns. He doesn’t have a gift certificate yet. So if he calls in the next few weeks, please make a reservation for him anyway or refer him to Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    ROOM PLACEMENT STRATEGIES\r\n    Did you read our review on Trip Advisor, where everything was super except the noise? There are things we can’t control, but right now in the off and shoulder season, there is no reason for us to get noise complaints. When checking guests in, don’t just leave them in the room the system assigns. Move them far away from each other with plenty of room in between, especially in building D.\r\n    If you are bored or while you go through upcoming reservations (which you should, every day, I found loose ends today when I did it), go to the availability page and just move rooms away from each other, please.\r\n\r\n    MORE STUFF\r\n    There is more important info in a memo hanging on the white board. Please read and initial. I wanted to keep it one page, so I didn’t write: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. YOU ROCK MY WORLD! But I meant it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2011 at 1:43 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING REPORT\r\n    When Raquel or Regino come to the office and give you the housekeeping report around 3 or 4, please update the housekeeping report in WRP. It’s very confusing for Raquel and us checking guests in the next day if you missed that step. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please remember to double check the clipper reservation notices in the basket on the back desk. You can’t check your own, but all others you can. Check the reservation in WRP (date, that it’s linked to Clipper account, that pricing is suppressed, that clipper number is written in guest comments, number of rooms and finally that room has been released, then check on clipper website that all info is correct and reservation is confirmed). Then date and initial and file the booking report.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Will be closed until Tuesday. Be aware of that when picking up the phones. 378-5800 is the line where Bird Rock phone calls come in. Also: please check the Bird Rock WRP over the next couple of days for online reservations.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2011 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    ROOM COFFEE\r\n    Sysco doesn’t carry Tully’s. We have to order that from FSA (info in my rolodex). I’ll order it Monday.\r\n    Thanks Kathy.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2011 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Weekend Everyone~ I left a message on Brad’s phone at Sysco saying, per Cindy, that we need 6 cases of Tully’s Reg.packets and 4 cases of Decaf-I never heard back from Brad on Friday. If someone can follow-up w/him(317-6300), I’d really appreciate it. I’m off for next 3 days…neener neener\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2011 at 8:34 am\r\n\r\n    USE OF ALARMS\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Great use of the alarms for massages to be booked and things to take care of. Just make sure to also leave notes in the guest comment section in WRP.\r\n    For example: alarm says “refund guest”. Please write in the guest comment section the story why we have to refund.\r\n    Alarm says “left message with guest about massage”, write in guest comment section “wants SBS massage, fee added, not confirmed, voucher needed.” And always write today’s date and your initials.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    CANDLE 101\r\n    So the new candles burn just fine when you take the wax of the wick and trim the wick a tiny bit before lighting. Also please please remember to put a little water in the votive before you put a new candle in. It makes the cleaning so much easier. And please don’t put smudgy votives out. Soak them in hot water and get all the old wax out with a paper towel, before placing in lobby.\r\n\r\n    GUEST PHONES\r\n    Remember when guests called to say their message light is blinking and there was nothing we could do about it? It’s fixed, yeah!\r\n    What we need to do is check guests in and out in the phone system every day. This might seem tedious at first, but it will be easier in the long run.\r\n    Every morning print out your check-outs for the day and around 11 go to the back desk phone (not the phone console, the actual phone), hit the “check in/out” button and follow the instructions.\r\n    After every ferry rush check our guests in in the phone system by using the same button and following the instruction, then file the invoices away (put in white box in bathroom), so we only have in our drawer the invoices of recent guests which need to be checked into the phone system. The reason being, we can’t clear message, messages clear automatically when we check in another guest.\r\n    I know this must sound overwhelming. It’s really no big deal. Have us show you. Please ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Rock On!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2011 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHER BOOK & MENU GUIDE\r\n    Guys, while we still have a little breathing time every once in a while I would like to make sure our menu guides and voucher books are up to date. I know some of you have been working on it, but I don’t know where we are at.\r\n    Please blog and let me know where we are at and what else needs to be done (which restaurants are missing, which provider’s rate sheet needs to be renewed). And then do it. Pretty please.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR – MORGAN\r\n    Will you please double check the road scholar rooming lists tomorrow and check for early arrivals and stayovers? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2011 at 12:00 pm\r\n\r\n    INN-LINK\r\n    We quit Unirez by Pegasus and switched to InnLink for our third party reservations like Priceline, Orbitz, Expedia, etc.\r\n    All should work smoother from now on and the procedure is the same: take 10% deposit, confirm reservation.\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT: don’t ever cancel InnLink reservations. Guests who wish to cancel or alter their third party reservation need to do so with the company they booked with (i.e. call Travelocity directly).\r\n\r\n    Please ask Cindy, Laura or I if you have any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2011 at 6:19 pm\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCH TOURS & KAYAK TRIPS\r\n    Looks like most providers are changing their prices a bit this year. So it doesn’t get too confusing for us, I changed all prices in WRP as follows:\r\n    Whale Watch: $79 pp, $52 for kids under 12\r\n    Kayak Trip: 3 hour – $79 pp, 5-6 hour – $99pp\r\n    Let’s see once we get all the new info from everybody if we need to adjust that.\r\n    If a guest notices or complains about the price difference (for example SJS kept their prices at $75)go ahead and adjust, but in general it won’t be necessary to adjust for every single provider. Too much info for us to keep track of.\r\n    But note: the zodiac trip at Western Prince ($99, $76 for kids under 6-12) and the price for kids with Capt Maya ($65) need to be manually adjusted.\r\n    If you are confused, please take a second and check out the provider you chose on the web. They all list their prices there.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2011 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN AIR TOURS – SCENIC FLIGHTS\r\n\r\n    Begins in May (Memorial Day) thru mid to late October. Fares start at $59/person. Phone for reservations is 378-7717.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Kathy!!! Steffi will be calling you today about the folio you had called her about yesterday. Cheers and have a super great day!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 12:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, Laura wants us to all be making sure when we put on Slacker Radio, to then click on Thievery Corp.Mix for appropriate lobby music ;)\r\n    Also, it seems like we are needing to double-check the dishes as they’re coming out of dishwasher at Birdrock-It doesn’t look like they’re coming out as clean (like coffee stains and jam left on dishes.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2011 at 9:48 am\r\n\r\n    Please do not reserve ANY reservations for anyone that is requesting that we do donations for them UNLESS Laura or I have given you the okay.. :)\r\n    Thank you :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2011 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY – RELAY FOR LIFE\r\n    We donated 6 room nights to the American Cancer Society, not valid 4/30/11 to 9/15/11. Dina Currier, their community relationship manager, will call in and reserve a Sky place during valid times when she comes up to work on Relay for Life. Please make her a complimentary reservation then. Ask Cindy or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Also: guests who come up for Relay for Life get a 10% discount.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2011 at 1:41 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFF BUSINESS CARDS\r\n    I have my own business cards, yeah! So if I’m not here and folks are inquiring about group bookings or (let’s hope not) need to speak to a manager, please hand them one of my cards. They are on my desk.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2011 at 10:45 am\r\n\r\n    PET POLICIES\r\n    When a guest makes a reservation for a pet friendly room:\r\n    Ask for pet’s name\r\n    At check-in, have guest fill out a pet registration form and file with invoices.\r\n    Hand guest our pet policies (write name of pet on it) and a doggie bone.\r\n    Those forms & bones can be found in the third drawer of the back desk.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    We had complaints this morning of too much chlorine in the pool. Eyes stinging, trouble breathing, a dark blue swim suit turned light blue, a black swim suit turned brown. Cindy, let’s check in with Seth & Morgan and see if we can use less chemicals.\r\n\r\n    BEACH CRUISERS\r\n    When checking out a beach cruiser, please have EACH guest sign a release form, the legal guardian of minors has to sign for them and print the minor’s name on the release form.\r\n    Then we need to hold on to a credit card or ID as long as the guest is out biking. Paper clip credit card to release forms and file in “cruisers out” file on back desk.\r\n    When guest comes back, give back credit card and file form with invoices.\r\n    Kids under 18 need to wear a helmet; it’s the law. But offer a helmet to all guests.\r\n\r\n    CASH\r\n    When you drop money, please use the small manila envelopes on top of the safe. Write your initials, today’s date and what’s in the envelope (cash, check, receipts) in small on the envelope, so we can empty them, cross out what you wrote and re-use them.\r\n\r\n    CURRENCY\r\n    We DON’T take personal checks as payment. Only credit cards (visa, master, amex), cash and traveler’s checks. Checks only with Cindy, Laura or my approval.\r\n\r\n    Gosh, I have a lot to say today. Thanks for bearing with me. Thanks for all your hard work. You rock my world!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2011 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys, Welcome to a busy Friday for me tonight! Time flew by! So the Lavendera Spa folks want to make sure that 1 of us tells (I mean asks)the gardeners to clear a way to the hose they need to water plants with. It is being blocked by a lovely rhody! Thanks, Kathy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2011 at 2:19 pm\r\n\r\n    MAGNESIUM?\r\n    Which wonderful person put the magnesium products in my box? Thank you so much. Looks like something I can rub onto the dog, the husband and myself and we’ll all get prettier and healthier, yeah! Thank you!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2011 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! I just wanted to let you know that Western Prince is up and running for the season. They’re wanting to do a trip every day but it does depend on the number of bookings they get. They have also spotted Orcas in the area on and off recently even though it is still early in the season.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2011 at 4:22 pm\r\n\r\n    A guest in the Sea Place recommended we have steak knives or some sort of sharp knife for cutting.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2011 at 3:38 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Our hot tub filter will be fixed, so we don’t have all thats and in the tub all the time. This will happen on Wednesday April 6th. So on April 6th and April 7th we won’t have a hot tub. Please let our guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2011 at 9:08 am\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    Just a reminder: we’ll have a mandatory all front desk staff meeting this Friday, 3/25 at noon at Earthbox. Myah will come at 12:30, so we can start with EB only stuff first and don’t bore her to death. Stevie will be out of town.\r\n    Everybody else: see you there!\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2011 at 11:40 am\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We’ll go over Clipper procedures during our staff meeting next Friday. For now, when you get a booking report from Clipper via email, please open the Acrobat Attachment and print it out. Put in Cindy’s or my box.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2011 at 8:23 am\r\n\r\n    FRONT DOOR KEY\r\n    Dude, I almost had a heart attack this morning, when my key didn’t open the front door. But worry not: the dead bolt key now works for both, dead bolt and front door lock. And the door knob is fancy, yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2011 at 1:19 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL REMINDER\r\n    When selling a special over the phone, please don’t select the special as the room rate in WRP, rather choose the rack rate and manually adjust the price.\r\n\r\n    ALARM 101\r\n    When a guest books an ad-on on an online reservation, please make an alarm and keep contacting the guest until whatever the guest requested is booked, fee added, confirmed, voucher made.\r\n\r\n    When a guest merely wants to be called about an ad-on (i.e. massage – I’m thinking, call me), we make an alarm to call, then we call the guest once, then we turn the alarm off. We don’t want to seem pushy or upselly.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, guys. Also: please don’t forget our front desk staff meeting on Friday, 3/25 at noon in the Earthbox lobby.\r\n\r\n    German lesson of the day: Atomkraft? Nein Danke!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 16th, 2011 at 8:50 am\r\n\r\n    Mr. San Juan:\r\n\r\n    We have donated the use of our pool as an award for the Mr. San Juan competition. Dan Deshon will come by and pick up the gift certificate. The deal is, they can use the pool “subject to availability”, see expiration dates on gift certificate (doesn’t include summer).\r\n\r\n    Dan Deshon Pool Party:\r\n\r\n    They will be having a small pool party on Saturday, March 26th. Please welcome them and give them a key, etc.\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2011 at 6:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! Kathy and I noticed a yucky smell back by Cindy and Laura’s office and found that that box of oranges were all moldy! :( We saved what we could and got rid of the rest.\r\n    - Stevie Mae\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2011 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    And remember:\r\n    F3 is your friend.\r\n    pressing the “F3″ button opens a search window and you can search the blog for key words, like “cancellation”. Neat stuff!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2011 at 2:02 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m going through reservations and noticed a couple of things:\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    When adding a massage, ww, kayak tour, etc. the three magic words I would like to see in the guest remarks are:\r\n    fee added\r\n    confirmed\r\n    voucher made\r\n    (alright it’s five words:)\r\n    And variations on that: so if a guest added a massage to their reservation online and you called and left a message asking when she would like to have it, the magic words would be:\r\n    fee added\r\n    left msg with guest\r\n    voucher needed\r\n    …and an alarm to follow up on this.\r\n    Once you got a hold of the guest and know the time and date, talked to the spa and made the reservation, and let the guest know when the massage is and the cancellation policy, the magic words are:\r\n    fee added\r\n    confirmed\r\n    voucher needed\r\n    …and an alarm for the voucher. Like that. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n    CANCELLATIONS\r\n    To properly cancel a reservation (say 10 days before the arrival, when we just keep the 10%deposit) please\r\n    1)cancel the reservation in WRP\r\n    2)cancel all add-ons and take charges off bill\r\n    3)apply cancellation fee by dividing 10% deposit by 1.078 (that’s the B4 tax total)\r\n    4)send cancellation email to guest\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Please write only in the subject line of alarms. All alarms should start with the arrival date of the reservation it pertains to.\r\n\r\n    Thank you guys. It was wonderful to have you all in one room the other day, my team! What a treat. We’ll have a great season and you rock!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2011 at 5:55 pm\r\n\r\n    The back office phone is now connected to it’s headset thanks to a little determination and our friend GOOGLE!!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2011 at 2:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS in the summer.\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    At this point, guests wanting to stay on a Friday or Saturday night in July, August or the first weekend in September, need to stay at least two nights. You can make an exception on the Friday nights at this point, but please don’t make exceptions on the Saturdays. If you have any questions, ask me.\r\n\r\n    p.s. This does not apply to Clipper bookings or Road Scholar guests wanting to extend a night. Oh, or for guests who are on a multi-day kayak trip and are coming for just one night at the beginning and just one night at the end of a trip.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 7th, 2011 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    MARCH 11 SPRING STREET PLAY “MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING”\r\n    Folks who come for the play and stay with us get rooms (Sky, Earth, Water) for $99 plus tax per night.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2011 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! Both vending machines are not functioning. Had to refund $$ and guest was not happy. Who do we call for service?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 4:28 pm\r\n\r\n    MARCH & APRIL SPECIALS\r\n    Check out our specials page on the website for our March & April special. We called it “Spring Splash” and it is what we were doing: $129 for a Water Place, $99 if you stay 2 nights or more, $149 for a Sky or Earth Place, $119 if you stay 2 nights or more.\r\n\r\n    Now: when you take a phone reservation, advertise those specials, but don’t select the special when making a phone reservation. Select regular rate and adjust room rate accordingly (unless guest says he was on website and saw special there). This way we’ll know who is actually reading our website.\r\n\r\n    REPEAT GUESTS\r\n    When making a phone reservation please always ask the guest if he stayed with us before and if he has, please select “repeat guest” as market code.\r\n    We are really trying to figure out where our guests heard from us and how we spend our advertising budget. Help us do it right!\r\n    Stevie Mae Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 9:52 am\r\n\r\n    Hey!! Duck Soup just emailed us, they will be open April 8th and I updated the menu in the restaurant guide!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2011 at 9:26 am\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Please make some. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2011 at 9:17 am\r\n\r\n    10% OFF KEY CARD SPECIAL\r\n    Just a clarification: our guests get 10% off their next stay upon showing us their key card ONLY off rack rates, not good with any other special.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2011 at 9:24 am\r\n\r\n    And our weekend super hero front desk goddess award goes to\r\n\r\n    ANGELA\r\n\r\n    yeah!!!!\r\n\r\n    who worked a double shift, while not feeling well and had 33 check-ins, a million phone calls and handled it, of course, like a pro!\r\n\r\n    Thank you Angela, you rock my world!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2011 at 10:25 am\r\n\r\n    EARTHBOX KEY CARD SPECIAL\r\n    Tell our guests upon check in: if you keep your key card and present it to us on your next visit, we’ll take 10% off your room rate. One key card discount per reservation. Cool.\r\n\r\n    PERSONAL CALLS\r\n    Please have all your peeps call in on the 378-4000. That way we’ll see who is calling on the caller ID and don’t have to interrupt guest calls or rush to the phone with our mouths full to get that call. Also: please limit your personal calls to the absolute minimum. Emergencies, a quick call to make an appointment or to confirm a lunch date. Phone calls are picking up and “running around like a chicken with no head” time is approaching, aaaahhhhhhh. No, this is good, this is why we are here and don’t forget to have fun.\r\n\r\n    PHONE LOG\r\n    Cindy is working on a final version to log our daily calls. We won’t count personal calls, but all other calls will need to be logged. We’ll show you how. This way we can better plan for staffing.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. This is going to be a great year. You should see the reservations we have on the books already. Uiiihhhh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2011 at 11:00 am\r\n\r\n    MANDATORY FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    on Friday, March 11, noon, at Earthbox. Short and sweet meeting about our new brand. Yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2011 at 10:43 am\r\n\r\n    WT?\r\n    Somebody is stealing water from our laundry room. They come equipped with hose and everything.\r\n    So, keep your eyes out. And: we changed the laundry room door so it functions like the pool door. Every guest can open it with their key and it locks itself at 10:00PM.\r\n    It’s o.k. to leave the laundry room open during the day when we are here. But let’s close it in the evenings.\r\n    Hey, this way guests can also see the sign which says when to stop doing laundry. It’s all good!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 13th, 2011 at 11:46 am\r\n\r\n    W4 2011\r\n    Hey everybody,\r\n    I put a W4 form for 2011 in each of your inboxes. Please fill out and put in Cindy’s box.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2011 at 1:55 pm\r\n\r\n    EXPEDIA\r\n    If you need to contact them for a reservation (I really hope you don’t, oh man), their vendor number is:\r\n    877-expedia\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2011 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE VAN\r\n    We will make the current shuttle van parking spot into a handicapped parking spot. The van will be parked in front of building D or up by A for now. Once we start hopping in the summer the van will be parked by Cindy & Laura’s office in front of the spa.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 4th, 2011 at 9:31 am\r\n\r\n    NEW WIFI PASSWORD\r\n    playful1\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 13th, 2011 at 10:47 am\r\n\r\n    CANCELLATIONS\r\n    Just a reminder: if you cancel a reservation, make sure you cancel all their add-ons as well (massages, whale watch, flowers, etc.), because we will have to pay for those.\r\n\r\n    You can’t cancel a UNIREZ reservation. The guest needs to cancel with whoever he booked directly, otherwise we will have to pay commission.\r\n\r\n    After canceling a reservation, apply a cancellation fee in the amount already paid: guest payment, divided by 1.078 (that’s the B4 tax amount) and send the guest a cancellation email.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered a box. Should be printed next week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 10th, 2011 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    WELCOME MORGAN AND KATHY\r\n    I miss you so much. Have a nice mellow shift. Call me at home if you need something.\r\n\r\n    Can one of you please take down the x-mas lights and cedar branches on the railing outside of the lobby, please?\r\n\r\n    Will you mop the lobby floor, especially if you used the de-icer, and vacuum, please?\r\n\r\n    FAX FOR LAURA\r\n    If you receive a fax for Laura, please put in my box. It’s important.\r\n\r\n    $50 OFF COUPON\r\n    Guests are starting to make reservations with those. Apparently Skagit Valley sent one to each Road Scholar participant.\r\n    The coupon is only good off the regular rate, not good with any other discounts. Expiration 5/13/11.\r\n\r\n    ROAD SCHOLAR\r\n    Just a reminder: road scholar participants get a 10% discount off our regular rates if they arrive a day early or tag on a night after their program. Make sure to write in the HK notes: Road Scholar early arrival or Road Scholar stayover. Also make an alarm for a month before their arrival, which stays: Road Scholar, make sure guest stays in same room. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 7th, 2011 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    TANNER-MCLEAN WEDDING 7/29\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    We’ll have a big wedding group in July. Guests will call in individually and make reservations for however many nights they want. Just make sure you link those reservations to the group.\r\n\r\n    FEBRUARY SPECIAL\r\n    We have a LOVE special in February. $129 for Sky, Earth, Water or $99 for the same rooms if you stay 2 nights or longer. Specials are in WRP.\r\n\r\n    JAN MURPHY – WILD AT HEART – 2/5\r\n    Jan will have a workshop here on 2/5. All participants will get rooms for $99. They’ll probably ask for the Wild at Heart rate.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    January 2nd, 2011 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody-\r\n\r\n    Mac got the decorations off the top of the tree for me :) Unfortunately, the star lights in the gift shop windows can only be removed after we take down the blinds, which I don’t know how to do and I worry about breaking them so I’m leaving it to someone more skilled with tools. Other than that, have a great month!!! See you all again in February :)\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    January 2nd, 2011 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    DECORATIONS\r\n\r\n    Got all of the front lights from windows except for giftshop. I couldn’t figure out how they were connected from window to window. :-( Also got tree ornaments wrapped and packed. Will take down tree lights if I’m able to.\r\n\r\n    FIRE\r\n\r\n    Okay, maybe it’s just me (and Regino)…….but we COULD NOT get the fire started this morning. Wood not dry enough?? And if there is any cardboard going to recycle, let’s keep it for fire starter. It works fabulously.\r\n\r\n    bye til february!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 30th, 2010 at 3:12 pm\r\n\r\n    YUK SEWER\r\n    We have a bit of a sewer back up in building A. Only 107 and 108 are affected. Seth called a plumber. The problem should be fixed by next Wednesday. The rooms are blocked out until then.\r\n\r\n    328\r\n    Is dirty, I moved guests. Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Seth will be off island tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY\r\n    Angela, Halley, will you be our grinches and start taking down the X-mas decorations, please? Boxes are in luggage room. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back. I missed you guys!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2010 at 8:38 am\r\n\r\n    Coffee is ordered for lobby :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2010 at 5:30 pm\r\n\r\n    EAT!\r\n    COHO brought us delicious homemade cookies to thank us for our referrals. We have chips, salsa, hummus & crackers in the back and, last but definitely not least: some of Mac’s outstanding smoked salmon in the fridge. Eat up!\r\n\r\n    105 – HIKING BOOTS\r\n    Guest left hiking boots. Raquel will bring them to the lobby tomorrow. Guest is on Orcas and will come and pick them up in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\n    314 – KID’S SHOES\r\n    Guest left kid’s shoes. Raquel found them. Left msg with guest.\r\n\r\n    Cindy will be out of town but reachable by phone until Monday. I’ll be back next Thursday (also have my phone).\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas everybody. You rock my world!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2010 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    JANUARY\r\n    When you make a reservation for a guest arriving in January, please let the guest know & write in the confirmation letter that our January office hours are 9AM to 5PM. Please also make a little note in the guest’s WRP file that he knows our open hours. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY SPECIAL\r\n    Our January special will be: any room (except of Wind Place) for $99 plus tax per night with the booking of any spa treatment. Guests will need to call for that special, they can’t book it on the website. Make sure to set up spa treatment right then when you have the guest on the phone.\r\n\r\n    AARP/AAA/Military discounts\r\n    As you know we officially don’t have them, but we do kind of. If a guest calls asking for any of those discounts, say:”We would love to give you a 10% discount for that.” BUT only on regular rates, NOT in addition to any special. Come Summer, make it more like 5%, please.\r\n\r\n    RADIO TRADE SCRIP WOMAN\r\n    O.K. there is a future guest, she has $300 in radio trade scrip. I talked to her at length twice about the fine print: radio trade scrip is only good on regular rates, NOT on specials, tax needs to be paid in cash or cc. She will stay with 5 people in an Earth Place and wants to negotiate a better deal than the regular rate ($167), says the rules aren’t fair, etc. Please adhere to the trade scrip rules. Ask Cindy or Laura if you have any questions. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for the fun party last night. I had a blast. Love you.\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2010 at 1:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, if any guests are wondering which restaurants are open over Christmas, here it is-on Christmas Eve (Fri.)the following are open: Downriggers, Rumor Mill(only until 3pm) & Rocky Bay(until 2 or 3pm). On Christmas Day the only place open is Coho’s and they’re almost sold out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 18th, 2010 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE CHANGES\r\n    Halley, Morgan and Kathy, please have a look at the schedule. We closed Bird Rock Sunday and Monday and we had to cut some shifts. Sorry, guys. But the following week we are hopping!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 16th, 2010 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    THE DEAL WITH BUILDING E\r\n    The roof is leaking in building E. 309 is not affected by this. The most affected is 310 where the leak seems to be above the bed (fun). I blocked those rooms out until next week. We have someone requesting 308 next week. Use you best judgment. If it’s raining, apologize and move the guest, please.\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN OUTFITTERS\r\n    Brian called to let us know that they are open for business in January. So if somebody wants a kayak tour, leave them a message and he will confirm it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2010 at 9:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Ho Ho Hello all,\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of easy things:\r\n\r\n    1) Be sure to check the water level in the tree every day. It’s a thirsty bugger.\r\n\r\n    2) With Xmas coming, a lot of personal packages will start being delivered along with the usual business materials. In order to minimize the chance of visiting staff offspring seeing boxes that might contain gifts, please place all incoming parcels in the back office until L or C can sort them. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 9th, 2010 at 3:08 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATE SPECIAL\r\n    We are having a 10% off sale on gift certificates. if someone buys one online, it’s calculated automatically. Do you all know how to process online gift certificates (they come through email via Boomtime)?\r\n    If someone calls and buys a $100 gift certificate, charge him $90 and put $10 in as a voucher, mention special in guest comments. Ask Cindy, Laura or I if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I’m listening to “Highway to hell” by ACDC, cool.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 6th, 2010 at 4:58 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK WRP\r\n    Please check the Bird Rock WRP several times during your shift and process new reservations. We are only open on the weekends, so also remember that you’ll get phone inquiries for Bird Rock on the 5800 line.\r\n\r\n    FUZZY FRIEND\r\n    Dave and Seth are looking for our fuzzy friend in my office. It’s a mess. Hopefully tomorrow we’ll know more.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there. Happy happy shift.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2010 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON\r\n    the decorating contest, Yeah!\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Please make some spa and lodging vouchers tomorrow. We are getting a lot of gift certificate inquiries for the holidays.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 2nd, 2010 at 4:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Wanna boat ride?\r\n    Naknek Charters is going on their sea lion tour on Monday at 1PM. They invited us to come and see the sea. If you are interested, give them a ring: Peggy – 378-9288.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 30th, 2010 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    Okay, I did a little market research and found out that customers don’t like looking through lots of specials, so I’ve changed our December special to read:\r\n\r\n    Dazzling December ~\r\n    Give yourself the gift of calm. Celebrate the Island Light Festival with us, do your holiday shopping away from the malls, have one of our beautiful beaches all for yourself. Stay any two nights in December and get the second night free. Only have one night? Come anyway and get any room (except the Wind Place) for just $129 per night. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).\r\n\r\n    In WRP, there are two specials, so that people can book online easier, there is the Dazzling December-Multiple Nights, and the Dazzling December-One Night. It will be difficult for a guest who is staying for more than two nights to figure out how to book online, so they will hopefully call. Here’s the deal on that: If someone is staying for three nights…they would get the first night at full price, the second night for free and the third night for $129. If they are staying for four nights, they’d get the two night special two times. Make sense?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2010 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    YEAH, Steph, Hiiiiiii! We miss you!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The new schedule will be up on Thursday. I have some calls in to people with reservations at BR trying to talk them into staying up here, so we can close BR midweek. If one of those guests call, please have Cindy move the reservation.\r\n    Stephanie Walker Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2010 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    Hi! It’s me. The other Steph. Just sitting here with Malcolm on my lap, thinking about you guys and wanted to say hello. Frozen pipes brings back memories. I miss you all and the Earthbox. So much snow! None here yet. I’m sure Malcolm would have loved to have gone to work with me at the front desk. Another life, I suppose. We will be back at least for a visit. Mark my words.\r\n\r\n    I hope today is smooth sailing with lots of bookings.\r\n    Love from Chicago,\r\n    Steph\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    November 28th, 2010 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    Hellooo, looks like Bldg D is back in service thanks to our local plumber.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2010 at 2:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thanksgiving! Well, I thought it’d be quiet, but turns out I was wrong. :-)\r\n\r\n    Bldg. D is closed temporarily due to a broken water pipe under the cedar room. I’ve moved the one guest that was checking into a Sun Place Pet today to Rm 314 with Cindy’s permission. Housekeeping has been informed of the pet. Another guest was booked into a Sun Place on the 28th and I have moved them to a Sea Place as well. (if fixed before then we could move them back to Sun Place Room) Bldg. D has been put into “Maintenance” through November…..so if the pipe is fixed before then please remove from M status.\r\n\r\n    Guess that’s all the good news I have. Hope you had a yummy Thanksgiving Day!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    ANGELA WEDNESDAY\r\n    Will you please make sure to write the correct opening hours for Thanksgiving (10:00AM to 4:00PM) on the door sign before you leave on Wednesday night? Thank you!\r\n\r\n    HEATER\r\n    Please leave the lobby heater (not the space heaters, the one outside the front desk) at 65 when you leave, at least as long as we are having this cold snap. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Stay warm everybody!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 4:06 pm\r\n\r\n    RESTAURANTS OPEN ON THANKSGIVING\r\n    Bluff – set menu, $50 per person\r\n    Downriggers – regular menu plus Thanksgiving specials\r\n    COHO – fully booked, only take reservations for waiting list\r\n\r\n    That’s it. Back Door, Place and Mc Millens are closed. Waiting to hear from Vinny’s.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2010 at 11:14 am\r\n\r\n    Two new specials are up for December, the first is for two nights, the second is for just one night.\r\n\r\n    “Dazzling December ~ Give yourself the gift of calm. Celebrate the Island Light Festival with us, do your holiday shopping away from the malls, have one of our beautiful beaches all for yourself. Stay any two nights in December and get the second night free. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).”\r\n\r\n    “Last Minute Getaway ~ Wanna give yourself the gift of calm but can only get away for one night? Come anyway and get any room (except the Wind Place) for just $129 per night. Valid thru December 31, 2010 (not valid on the Wind Place or with any other special).”\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2010 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    JANUARY CLOSURE\r\n    Just to clarify: we will be open at Earthbox through January. The trinity of boss ladies will run the hotel, yeah!\r\n    We will however we closed at Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK WRP\r\n    Whenever we are closed at BR, please make sure to check the BR WRP for online reservations and process. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 15th, 2010 at 3:12 pm\r\n\r\n    $$$$$ CASH $$$$$\r\n    Please count the cash drawer everyday before closing. Also, Halley or Cindy, whoever is running errands tomorrow, will you please take the $100 and break it into $10’s and $5’s at the bank, please?\r\n\r\n    ***** HOLIDAYS *****\r\n    Angela, Kathy & Morgan: Please email me your plans for Christmas, your work availability and your preferences. Thank you.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 13th, 2010 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST VOICE-MAIL\r\n    I can’t seem to get into the guest voice-mail boxes to clear old messages. I think the automatic dialer’s timing is off.

He also said that all of building D is ready to be put back into use. Should we unblock it? Also, I need someone to show me how to block out rooms and unblock them.

You know those lovely, yummy candles we have floating around these days? You know, the ones that start to smoke when their wicks get too long and they leave a black ring around the top of the glass and the wick gets all goobery?? Pretty please, before you light them, can you please trim the wick so they don’t get too long and turn into yucky, icky candles instead of lovely, yummy ones?\r\n\r\n    Thanks for humoring me.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2010 at 3:43 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Starting 10/1 the spa will be open from noon to 5 Monday through Friday. 9-5 on the weekends.\r\n\r\n    EXPLORITAS\r\n    Are now called Elderhostel again or Road Scholar, either works.

The December one will be an underwater tree decorating. Is that cool or what?\r\n    Guests who are going diving with them on those dates get a special rate with us. In WRP go to the month, group folios, see notes. Questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n\r\n    STAFF DINNER\r\n    Oh cool. Thank you Cindy and Laura! What a wonderful thing to do for us. You guys are the Bestestest!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 23rd, 2010 at 11:52 am\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT CHANGES **** :)\r\n\r\n    1.

Please make sure to let all check in ’s know our schedule and make arrangements for them if they are checking in after that time..\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have any questions..\r\n\r\n    Thanks,\r\n\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Uh, so much to say tonight:\r\n    FANS IN ROOMS\r\n    HK took all the box fans out of the rooms today. And all our guests are calling to get them back. Coolish or not, it is still warm in the rooms. Will you please let HK know NOT to remove the fans I brought back tonight. Also: if somebody calls you for a box fan, there are in the upstairs HK closet (walk in, turn right, open closet door) in building A.\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK HAS NO INTERNET\r\n    Hey guys. Our sister has no internet. Cindy and Laura will find a way to fix this soon.\r\n    For now the guys and gals down there will take phone numbers from guests who wish to make a reservation, then call us up here and we’ll need to call those guests back and make the reservation from up here. If it’s too complicated, please make sure to leave those phone numbers for Morgan on Wednesday, so we don’t loose those guests.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY 10/3\r\n    Laura o.k.ed a kid’s b-day party for a friend (Tanja)in our pool house that day.

It’s important for all of us to be there and talk about the future.\r\n\r\n    MY PHONE MESSAGES\r\n    Guys, we need to find a better way to take phone messages for me. I had many calls on my phone today after working at Bird Rock all week for things already past or group inquiries which could have already found a different place to stay. From now on: if somebody calls for me, will you please take the message and email it to me? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, Laura and I planning something fantastic for you, because you rock our world!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2010 at 1:16 pm\r\n\r\n    First-Aid kit has been restocked w/thermometer, advil, neosporin, and lots of band-aids and other things-it’s in the bathroom.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2010 at 8:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi! Looks like we’re starting to get calls for reservations in November and folks are looking for special rates. Are we going to offer a special for Thanksgiving?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2010 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE SPECIAL SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN\r\n    What Kathy said:) And: this special is not in WRP, please manually adjust the room rate for runners to $99. This special does not have a 2 night minimum.\r\n\r\n    ISLAND DAZZLE\r\n    We lowered the Island Dazzle (midweek, 2 night minimum) to $99 plus tax per night. Entered in WRP\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR\r\n    We have a promotion going on the Ttrip Advisor page for 10% off any room any night regardless of length of stay. This promotion is not in WRP. If a guest makes a phone reservation and asks for the Trip Advisor discount, please manually adjust the nightly room rate. Please also use “Trip Advisor” as the market code for those reservations.\r\n\r\n    Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    Miss you guys.

Please let our night managers know.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Khai or Cindy, can you print out some more spa voucher, please? We seem to be low.\r\n    All of us: please make a handful of spa vouchers each shift. It is so not nice when you have to make one on the fly and we are all out.\r\n\r\n    BLOGGING?\r\n    I’m the Bird Rocking girl for the next couple of weeks. Will you guys please blog a thing or two everyday so I know what’s what?\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    Hang in there, Gorgeous, for your double shift. I can’t believe you are leaving us. I will miss you so much. Thank you for all your hard work. Good luck and have fun and be good, but have fun, but nothing dangerous, and learn a lot!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2010 at 12:39 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered more printer paper 9-9-10, they will bring it to us on 9-10-10..

I think we might need to print some out–didn’t see anymore in the basket. I’ll try to make a bunch on Sunday when I’m on the night shift.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2010 at 3:18 pm\r\n\r\n    SAUNA\r\n    Is reset. Seth will talk to Dave tomorrow to get a new relay switch.\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Don’t forget to ship the you know what today, starts with “p”, in plastic bag underneath our inboxes……\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2010 at 3:13 am\r\n\r\n    The sauna does not appear to be heating up. I don’t know If it is related to the recent power outage or not. The control panel seems fine and no breakers have been flipped. We may need to call Dave or West Mechanical to take a look.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2010 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    POTATO\r\n    O.K. so Raquel was approached by a guy to please put a potato between the sheets in room 325. He is playing a joke on the guests in there. So if the guests run into the lobby furious over the unwanted vegetable add-on, please explain: this was a joke from your friend. I sure hope, they find it hilarious.\r\n\r\n    206\r\n    Has a broken sink. This needs to be fixed before Tuesday. Please give Seth a heads up on Monday. Guest moved, room blocked out.\r\n\r\n    $50 SUPER COOL GUEST SAVINGS CARDS\r\n    Our guests (only the super cool ones) are starting to redeem those. Just a reminder: they are ONLY good on rack rates, can not be combined with any other specials. If a guest books a “special rate” or “limited offer” room, calculate room rate from rack rate (as in: rack rate is $150, limited offer room rate is $130, room after $50 off coupon would be $100 – $50 off rack rate). Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    Other than that we are doing great. Had another add-on mishap, but the ultimate guest whispering team Brynn & Steff straightened it all out. We’ll do better next time, right?\r\n\r\n    Happy end of the season everybody. Have a great vacation Brynn and Halley. Love you all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2010 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Guys, we had 2 reservations today with lot’s of add-ons and nothing was booked. Plus it’s difficult to book things this weekend so late in the game. Please please please check all online reservations very very carefully for massages, whale watch tours, kayak trips and Romance packages. Do it for your coworkers.\r\n    Also: whenever you have a minute to breeze, go through upcoming reservations and make sure we didn’t miss anything. Our season is almost over. Just hang in there for a little longer. Eyes wide open, brain on, go!!!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2010 at 10:22 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n\r\n    Okay, now I remember this happened last upgrade. So for now, all existing reservations that were made before August 31, 2010 may have a 1 cent overage or shortage. If this happens please post the difference to payment selection “voucher”\r\n\r\n    This should not happen to reservations that were made after the upgrade.\r\n\r\n    **I just noticed the blog clock is off, it is actually only 10:38 am.. That threw me for a minute..\r\n\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2010 at 10:18 am\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS**\r\n    We have our Island Dazzle up and running, starting Sunday September 5, 2010 book two nights between a Sunday and a Thursday night and get a nightly rate of $149.00 on either Earth, Sky or Water..\r\n    Thanks to Khai we now have our new SJ Health Club vouchers.. Check them out and offer them up… $15.00 for a day at the fitness club 17 yrs old and up, children the age of 6 yrs to 16 are $10.00, children under the age of 5 are free.\r\n    Please treat them as you would any other voucher.\r\n    Enjoy the sunny day… It is perfect back to school weather..:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2010 at 12:37 pm\r\n\r\n    I made some new vouchers for the health club. If anyone wants to use the pool or gym there, it costs $15 per person for a full day pass. Just add the charge like we add any other “adventure” voucher. The vouchers are in the voucher folder :)\r\n    kathy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 5:20 pm\r\n\r\n    We need to make some Earthbox lodging vouchers\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    Okay, the booking options are fixed back to the way they were.. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2010 at 11:13 am\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n    We just updated our WRP, you may not even notice much, but please check it out. One thing I noticed was that now it shows which guest are in, when you view the main calendar page.\r\n    The other thing is that now when an online reservation comes in it does not show the details of the extra’s they are interested in on their main customer page, you have to see if there are additional costs and then go into their profile and see what they have selected. I have an email into WRP, and am requesting this to be changed back to the old way, so I will let you know if they can.\r\n    Under miscellaneous on the left hand side of the WRP page, click on New Features to see what they have added. You can also look at the training videos there also. Just to refresh of course :)\r\n    What do you think of this weather, it tells me it is time for school…:)\r\n    Have a good Tuesday..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Our beach cruisers took a beating today. I think we had 7 fallen soldiers. Morgan brought them to island Bicycle for repair. they will call us when they are ready.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Will you please call Rochelle from Victoria Clipper 206-448-5000 tomorrow when you get in. They don’t know who’s cellphone you dropped off and I don’t either. Thank you, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2010 at 1:04 pm\r\n\r\n    DINING VOUCHERS\r\n    Great job, Halley! Cindy will write McMillens a check on Monday.\r\n    Just to make sure we all know: the restaurants participating in our dining voucher program are: Back Door Kitchen, COHO, Vinnie’s, The Place, The Bluff & Duck Soup Inn.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE WEEK OF 9/6\r\n    We needed to make some changes to the schedule. Affected are Kathy, Angela, Khaili, Brynn & Morgan. Please look closely. Thanks for hanging in there for the final sprint to the end of the season. You all rock!!!!!!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2010 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Y’all!!!\r\n    The guy I accidentally double booked at Birdrock never showed up over there tonight. We had an emergency hold room here for him but since he was a no show we gave it to someone else. Also, some guests were either misinformed about how dining credits worked or just spaced out on the restrictions. They tried to use theirs out at McMillan’s. The server said she would honor it but we have to write them a $75 check. The guests were still sitting at their table so I OK’d that, didn’t know what else to do. Let me know if there’s a problem with that solution and I will help try to work it out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2010 at 10:07 am\r\n\r\n    Champagne has been ordered from Market Chef. Should be here Tuesday. Half come here, half goes to BR. Thanks!\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2010 at 7:22 pm\r\n\r\n    I put a purple bicycle on the side(by the van)- it has a flat tire, thanks, Kathy\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2010 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys– just to let you know, Lakedale has a Cabin available on Friday and a room in the lodge open on Saturday..so refer people out there if they are asking about availability this weekend!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 10:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Water\r\n    We are out of water for the lobby. I believe Steffi said that she left a message with Island Water to get more but please call again tomorrow (Tuesday). The two water bottles in the back office belong to Ace. We need to return them and let them know “Zia” has brought them back. There is a $7 deposit on each bottle they will take off our account.\r\n    Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Off camping. Rattlesnakes and bears and beers, oh my.\r\n    Be good. Love you.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2010 at 4:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Map paper ordered\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2010 at 10:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin!\r\n    Lots o’ fun things to pass on.\r\n    – There are two bikes behind the house. The black one is fixed and needs to be returned to BR. The purple one needs to go to Island Bicycles due to a loose bottom bracket and sketchy braking. They may be related.\r\n    – If they can’t drop them off when we are open, 302 will be leaving a few bags by the door. They will be back on Thursday to grab them.\r\n    – Had my first crash of the TV system. I think it just got too hot in there and the breaker blew. Whee.\r\n    – If it hasn’t been ordered yet we need to phone in for another case of map paper.\r\n    I think that’s about it. BTW could someone please turn off the heat?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2010 at 5:05 pm\r\n\r\n    OUTDOOR ODYSSEY\r\n    Clark from Outdoor odyssey checked in with me today. We had a little glitch with #2456413 at BR. They didn’t have that couple on the books at all, the couple didn’t know anything about the tour, etc.\r\n    Whenever you book an adventure, just write in the guest remarks with whom you made the booking (has kayak with OO on 9/14, 10AM, fee added, confirmed 9booking made with Clark), voucher made).\r\n    Clark will also bring by a flier we will attach to OO vouchers which explains what to bring, wear, expect, etc. Those fliers will be kept with the vouchers in the voucher logs.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2010 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy….\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Our wifi is slow. We are in the middle of upgrading. Please ask our guests for patience. All shall be wonderful next week.\r\n\r\n    SODA MACHINE POOL\r\n    Seems to be out of things. Left msg with pepsi guy. Cindy, can you call him again tomorrow, please?\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    The older one keeps eating folks’ money and not doing the job. I put an out of order sign on it. Any word when the washer we ordered will be installed?\r\n\r\n    TONER\r\n    In printer in my office is almost empty. Morgan, can you replace that when you have a chance, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy middle of the Summer season!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2010 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Message from Duck Soup: Always, always, always make a reservation! They had to turn away some people last night who we had sent out there saying it was mid-week and they wouldn’t need reservations….bummer! Oh well, just something for us to keep in mind.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2010 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Please please please keep the safe locked at all times. We have lots of guests belongings in there :)\r\n\r\n    Speaking of which, I couldn’t find any safe deposit bags, so there are a guests belongings in the safe in a ziplock bag with their name on it. Please ask me if you have any questions about this.\r\n\r\n    Brynn or Lilly, the bag in the back needs to be sent off tomorrow. Their name and everything are in the bag, you will see it.\r\n\r\n    342 may stop by in the morning, possibly trying to switch into a earth place. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\n    See you all soon :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2010 at 6:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Well we are selling out quick for this week. I took the liberty of putting 303 (our last room) on hold for Wednesday and 215 on hold for Thursday. Friday and Saturday already have hold rooms.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 10:01 pm\r\n\r\n    A few FYI’s\r\n    115 needs a new remote. I brought new batteries to them and reprogrammed their old remote and it didn’t quite work. I got hit by the ferry rush at 9:30 and couln’t make it up there until it was clear. They called in to tell me they were just going to bed. They ask that we bring them a new remote in the morning. Khai-chan could you see to that?\r\n\r\n    There is a bag of jackets in the back office by the “storage room” door. That needs to be mailed off on Thursday or Friday. Use the CC info and address on file.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY\r\n    Please please please take the garbage out (wipe prints from garbage can), vacuum, dust, and straighten up the lobby every night. This is the first impression our guests have, when they come to visit us and we shall make it a clean one!\r\n    Thank you so much.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2010 at 9:43 am\r\n\r\n    Lilly or Brynn-\r\n    There are a couple of jackets on the back desk, they will need to be sent via post san juan on Thursday. They are for reservation #2181195.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2010 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    2011 RATES\r\n    We are starting to get 2011 inquiries. Our summer rates are not entered yet. The boss ladies will work on that after labor day. Until then, if somebody wants to make a reservation for 2011, take their name and number, we’ll match 2010 prices for them, I will call them and make a reservation for them.\r\n\r\n    What a gorgeous day today, island freshly washed, perfect weather, good air, nice!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2010 at 10:41 pm\r\n\r\n    FUN WITH ATM’s\r\n    One of the guest in 203 had her ATM card “eaten” by the Wells Fargo ATM. It took her card, gave her a “Out of Service” sign, and then shut down. Steffi left messages with as many of the WF employees as we could track down. We are trying to see if the bank manager can open the machine up to free the card. There is a small stack of papers next to the fax/copier with phone numbers to the WF employees we found. Keep an ear out if the bank manager calls us. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2010 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All..\r\n    New item: When you open the pool patio doors please make sure the pad lock is on the front wood gate. There is no exceptions to this, it must be locked as long as the pool doors are open, once they are closed you may unlock the pad lock. Remember no one else may have the key to unlock it, only the front desk staff.. Ask Khai or Steffi where it is kept now.\r\n    If you walk by the pool and the side door is propped open and no one is around, please close the door and let Steffi or I know..\r\n    Any questions give us a call..\r\n    Have a good weekend, and remember you are all a bunch of ROCK STARS..\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    The bag on the back desk is for a guest that will be checking in tomorrow (the name is on a tag on the bag) please make sure she receives it when she checks in!\r\n\r\n    Also on the back desk, one of our irons has a short in it…guest said it would turn on then off repeatedly..should we get rid of it or can it be fixed?\r\n\r\n    We need more trash bags at the front desk…we only have the little ones! Also we need to get some more tea..we are running out..do we have any in the orca room?\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Anyone know where the pool patio pad lock is?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    OOPS one more thing, please do not edit or add anything other then what is on the Earthbox Groove on Pandora..\r\n    Thanks…\r\n    Kathy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    The guest checking in tomorrow (confirm.#-2453048), first name Katie, has a bag in the backroom on the desk. Please remove the tag w/guest name on it and give to her. Thank you, Kathy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2010 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Our favorite maintenance man broke his wrist :(\r\n    He is going to be left handed for a while.. Regino will be helping out with maintenance for a little while..\r\n\r\n    Guest survey’s~I just sent off a stack of survey’s back to the SJIVB, Yah.. thank you for getting those out to the guests. Don’t forget to keep passing them out…The information is important..\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2010 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of things-\r\n\r\n    First, the Mary Kay makeup bag on the back desk needs to be taken to post san juan tomorrow. I tried to take it today but they needed a credit card to pay for packaging (box) and then they will charge the shipping costs to the fedex account written on the Post SJ slip. Please call him tomorrow and let him know that his credit card will be charged for the packing costs.\r\n\r\n    Also, a guest named Leora Peterson left something plugged in underneath the bar in her room. Could you please have Raquel check for it and then call Leora.\r\n\r\n    Thanks guys, see you soon\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    324\r\n    is blocked out because it has no fridge. We moved their fridge into 335 because 335’s fridge smelled like sour milk. 335’s fridge is in the cedar room to air out. Please let Raquel know and make sure the fridge in 324 gets replaced before tomorrow’s check-in.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    We have a lost& found request over a week old (i-pod arm wrist and charger). Guest called back to ask again. The sheet keeps getting moved from the back desk to my office without anybody writing on it if the item has been found, if the guest has been contacted.\r\n    Can you please ask Raquel tomorrow if the item has been found. Then please call the guest with the answer. Then write on the sheet what all happened.\r\n    Thank you so much!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone…..Just a quick reminder for AM shift–please try to get the “check outs” done before you leave. PM shift gets busy with “check-ins” and miscellaneous room requests, reservations, etc. especially when we have a full house. Thank you!! :-)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2010 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Cindy.. you’re on vacation. No blogging allowed.\r\n\r\n    I watered the orchid :) It will probably need more water in a week\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    110\r\n    Checked some folks into 110 and it wasn’t clean. PLEASE make sure you tell Raquel this time!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone! Just let you know that Victoria Clipper reservations are exempt from the “two night” minimum for Saturday stays. So if the Victoria Clipper calls to make a reservation for a Saturday night go a head and let them. Thank you!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2010 at 2:00 am\r\n\r\n    Refilled the jacuzzi last night. I didn’t put the sign up. Water will be fine chemically but a bit colder than it should be. Feel free to put it up if people complain. It’s just inside the chem room door.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2010 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    by Morgan’s door have a fallen off chain. Please bring to bike shop in the morning.\r\n\r\n    110\r\n    moved guest because of noise. Please let Raquel know that room needs to be cleaned\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 4:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Island Dazzle….\r\n\r\n    I’m just so dazzled by this special, I decided to extend it through August 26th.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 12:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Fritz will be coming to pick up 2 or 4 more standard size pillows, and returning 2 king pillows, Raquel has them in the back so call her if I am not here.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2010 at 12:32 pm\r\n\r\n    REMINDER\r\n    Please remember to tell housekeeping if a guest extends their stay or leaves a day early. If it happens after you print the housekeeping report they won’t have any knowledge of the change. So please. Keep them in the loop. It makes Raquel and Regino happier.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 5:35 pm\r\n\r\n    2 NIGHT MINIMUM\r\n    I had some guests call and ask if we could make an exception to the 2 night minimum stay on Saturdays through the summer. We can’t. But I said if they call the Friday before the Saturday they would like to come and we still have many unsold rooms we would consider a one night stay on a Saturday. Make sense?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 11:37 am\r\n\r\n    Happy blogging :)\r\n    Sometimes we have envelopes for people to stop by and pick up at the front desk. I am going to start putting them in the voucher file under the front desk, under the person’s last name. This way we don’t have a bunch of stuff on the back desk. There are two in there right now that had been sitting on the back desk since the beginning of last week.\r\n    :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2010 at 2:31 am\r\n\r\n    Some maintenance stuff that needs to be addressed tomorrow:\r\n    343 – Complained late at night that their AC isn’t working. Said that they had it on “Cool” and it hadn’t turned on for several hours. I went over some possible fixes with them over the phone and I hadn’t heard back. Seth might want to take a look just to make sure it’s nothing other than the usual.\r\n\r\n    102 – Tub faucet fell off. The retaining ring that tightens to hold it on to the pipe snapped. I couldn’t find a replacement so I had to move the lady in there. Please have Seth take a look at it. I think all it needs is a quick replacement.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2010 at 4:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Halli hallo!\r\n\r\n    $50 OFF PROMOTION\r\n    Please make sure to give them to all our guests, together with the SJIVB surveys.\r\n    Please know the $50 off promotion is only good for rack rates, may not be combined with any other special. Read the fine print on the back.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please double check the Clipper allocation release forms in the basket on the back desk. You can double check all but the ones you entered.\r\n\r\n    CASH $$$$$$$$$\r\n    Please count the till every night and drop cash income into the safe.\r\n\r\n    Happy sunny day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2010 at 3:32 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m on a blogging streak….\r\n    The new, gorgeous orchid in the lobby needs to be watered once a week at most. It was just watered on Friday, so next Friday it could probably use some water. I think we should blog when we water it. Orchids are picky :)\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2010 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a post san juan slip made out for samantha wood on the back desk. she will be receiving a package soon address to her name, please forward the package through post san juan using the pre made slip. thank you!\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2010 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n    Just a reminder to ask how the guests want the bed in the Wind Place, and write it in the housekeeping requests and in the remarks. Thanks!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2010 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    *EMAIL*\r\n\r\n    We didn’t receive any email today until around 7:30pm, and many guests say they haven’t received the confirmation emails we’re sending out. I think there may be a serious glitch in our email.\r\n\r\n    BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS OK!!! :) We’re sold out tonight. Yahoo!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2010 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Please make sure room 218 gets a fan tomorrow, they are staying for three nights and didn’t have a fan in their room for some reason but would like one for their next two nights, thanks!!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2010 at 5:16 pm\r\n\r\n    #2429483 left a pair of shoes and an i-phone charger in their room. Can someone please call housekeeping in the morning and find out if they have any of these items and then call the guest and let them know. Thanks!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2010 at 11:31 am\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    HI folks. Just a reminder that when you are making clipper reservation (by either phone or fax) to make sure you attach them to the Victoria Clipper corporate account. That way they will show up when Cindy does the billing. Also, when you book the rooms for them via fax. Make sure you write our reservation number next to the guest name on the fax you are sending back to the Clipper. That way they will stop calling us to get the number. Thank you! :D\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2010 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    Hello :)\r\n    I wanted to let you all know that we just ordered a new coin operated washer for the guest laundry….No more coin eating machines..\r\n    I also ordered some IPOD clock radio’s for BR, so if you see that come in, let Raquel know so she can bring them down there.\r\n    Please be really careful when setting a wake up call.. We want to make sure all our guests get up when needed, also recommend to them to use the clock radio’s as a back up..\r\n    I have a call into Bob, for him to come and finish the phone console…Let me know if you see him if I am not here..\r\n    Remember~ASK your guests to comment on TRIPADVISOR.COM…..we want to hear from them.. That is how we can continue to improve..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2010 at 8:00 pm\r\n\r\n    206 – HAIRDRYER\r\n    keeps blowing the hair dryer fuse. Guest requested a new hair dryer for Tuesday. Please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK PRINTER\r\n    is not working, something something cartridge….\r\n\r\n    A/C UNITS BUILDING D\r\n    We had all our A/C units serviced. They are all in working order. However, those are older units and they won’t make the room icy cold on hot days. They will maybe take the temperature down 15 degrees, but not much more. And they shut off when they reach the point where they would freeze up otherwise. Just explain to our guests to turn on the fan after the units shut off. They will turn on again after they are ready.\r\n    And if somebody rents a room solely for the A/C, please let them know, the room won’t be like a walk-in cooler.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2010 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    I organized the shelves in the back office this morning. I put all the manuals in the middle file cabinets in the back if anyone needs them.\r\n\r\n    I got some more of the backdoor menus in the rooms. There are only a few left :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2010 at 12:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody– Sunday 8/1…Would anyone be willing to switch a shift with me? I am trying to go offisland with my Dad but he only has weekends off :( I could switch with any of you and work your Monday or Tuesday. Please let me know asap! Thank you :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2010 at 6:27 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS\r\n    We need them. Please make a few every shift.\r\n\r\n    PET POLICIES\r\n    We need them as well. If we run out, please print some more.\r\n\r\n    MENUS\r\n    There are still rooms which have the old Back Door Kitchen menu in their guest directory. Let’s try to get them in in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\n    With it being summer, me working at both properties and all of us being so busy I need you guys to be my eyes and ears. If we run low on something, fill it or blog that it needs filling. If I ask you to do something, do it or blog that you didn’t get to it. Pretty please?\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS\r\n    Please read emails and our website for new specials.\r\n\r\n    Gorgeous day, happy guests, fairs and plays and whales and things, it’s summer!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    Oh one more thing there are “GUEST SURVEY’S” at the front desk… EVERY GUEST needs one at check in, and please ask them to return them before check out….It is for the Visitor’s Bureau to gathering some information on our guests that visit the San Juan’s.. When the guest return them, please put them in my box..\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 11:10 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday~\r\n    Please don’t give anyone Seth’s cellphone when they call. I just had a rude experience with some sales call.. We may take messages for Seth but don’t pass sales call off to him or non sales calls.. Messages please.\r\n    AC~there is nothing wrong with the AC’S Seth has cleaned them and checked them.. If they click off have the guest turn the knob more towards the cool.. Seth will call to ask WM some questions today and I will keep you updated if there is anything else we need to do.\r\n    The washer in the guest laundry has a new cord on it. Seth is doing a load right now to make sure it is all cool to go..\r\n    Sophie will be here this weekend..:)\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2010 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone! I was working Weds evening and Webrezpro went down for quite a while and I was unable to retrieve any information regarding check-ins and room availability. Not fun….Morgan came down and helped me out….Thank you!!!\r\n\r\n    So Cindy has asked that the morning shift print a “check in” list every day. That should keep us out of trouble if we lose power or the reservation system goes down again.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 10:08 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    We call West Mechanical if something is wrong with the guest washers and Seth can’t fix it. Khai, can you have Seth have a look at the washer and then call West Mechanical, please (number on phone list)?\r\n\r\n    338\r\n    Khai, can you make sure Seth looks at the air conditioning in room 338. It wasn’t working for the last 2 days (had to refund) and we have a guest checking in especially for the AC tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Thank you. Have a great shift everybody.\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    The first washing machine knob has broken off and there is no way to start it….who do we call to fix it?\r\n    Valerie Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello=)\r\n    Steffi, i changed summer menu in 6 rooms for today!\r\n    I continue in next time!!\r\n    ohhhh…motel is really busy!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    MARKET CODE CHANGES:\r\n\r\n    Important changes guys. And when I say important, I mean it! This is super critical stuff for us to be able to track how people hear about us so that we can know where we need to advertise.\r\n\r\n    I have changed the market codes so that there are only 12 codes now. Please STUDY THEM CAREFULLY. If you have any questions ASK, ASK, ASK. I would much rather that you ask me about this stuff than just fill something in that is not correct.\r\n\r\n    When you study this list, you will see two NEW entries. One is X-direct online booking. Do not use this code…ever. This is automatically entered when people book directly online.\r\n\r\n    The other new booking is the $50 Super Cool one. This is used for the new CUSTOMER RETENTION CARDS which you should give to each guest that checks in. READ this card and see all of the information. This card is to be used on any future booking, but it cannot be used in combination with any other special.\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS? ASK!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2010 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Please remember to keep the bikes locked throughout the day..\r\n    AND\r\n    Don’t forget about the cute little red MOPED, it needs to come out of the pool patio ever morning..\r\n    Please don’t leave the broken bikes sitting for more than 12 hours, if there is something that needs attention on them, make sure to have Seth or Morgan look to see if they can fix them and if not, or if they are not on schedule, ship them over to Island Bicycles..\r\n    Front Desk Staff\r\n    When you have a few moments can you keep your eyes out for garbage that is left out by the garden and entry area to the office. It will just take a few moments to walk up and do a quick pick up..\r\n    Enjoy…..You are all AWESOME….\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2010 at 5:24 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHING MACHINES\r\n    It looks like the “newer” washing machine that was just fixed is starting to act up again. It is making some very loud “thunking” noises while operating. I know Seth called Geiser and Sons to look at the “older” machine. Perhaps they can look at the other one as well.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2010 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    NO PERSONAL COMPUTER USE!\r\n\r\n    Hi guys, I hope you’re all having a great summer. You are working so hard and I really appreciate it. Our computers are also working hard, and as you know, they are sometimes “freezing up”.\r\n\r\n    It has become clear that several of you are using the computers for personal use. I need to reiterate that this is absolutely NOT okay. When you use these computers for personal use, you are opening up our ENTIRE system to viruses. This costs us lots of money and can wreak havoc.\r\n\r\n    Please do NOT use the computers for personal use and do NOT erase the “history” in Firefox or Explorer. We absolutely need to see what websites have been visited so that we can track down where these viruses are coming from.\r\n\r\n    So, in summary, PLEASE treat these computers with the utmost respect and TLC. If you need to use a computer for any personal reasons, use the lobby computer (or the upstairs one at Bird Rock) during your breaks.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    Laura\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 5:13 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ\r\n    We are having some issues with UNIREZ. For now, in case you get 2 reservations with the same name, please call the travel agent and confirm that the guest really meant to make 2 reservations.\r\n\r\n    AIR CONDITIONER 334\r\n    There is nothing wrong with it. Please let our guests know that the thermostat (the big knob going from red to blue) needs to be turned all the way to blue, otherwise the air conditioner thinks you want it warm. Also, on really hot days, the thingy shuts off every once in a while and kicks back on 10 minutes later. It’s just taking a little break so it doesn’t burn out. Like us:)\r\n\r\n    PHONE CONSOLE\r\n    Our phone console is feeling ill. She don’t work correctly right now. Centurytel is working on it. Right now our guests can’t check messages and we can’t either. So don’t leave messages in guest rooms and tell our guests patiently, if their message light is blinking, we can’t clear those old message right now.\r\n    Cindy, all the other issues are still going on. Please let the guy know.\r\n\r\n    Happy week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY MENUS\r\n    Hey Khai, Brynn & Lilly. On Wednesday will you goddesses please finish to put the summer Back Door Kitchen menus into the rooms? They are in Valerie’s box, together with a map of the rooms which are done already. Thank you!\r\n    Valerie Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2010 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone=)\r\n    Steffi, i changed menu for today just in 3 rooms, because other rooms are occupied!! and we need continue this!\r\n    Wow…This is my first post!!!)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2010 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDDING BAND\r\n    Our guest in 340 lost his plain gold wedding band. he doesn’t know where. If somebody turns it in, please call him.\r\n\r\n    341\r\n    Our guests in 341 may need help with their luggage upon check out on Wednesday. They are super nice and fit, but have bad backs.\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    Please call the Clipper again on Monday. We need to get yesterday’s release on the books.\r\n\r\n    VALERIE\r\n    Please continue putting the Summer 2010 Back Door Kitchen menus in the rooms you couldn’t get to today. I put them in your box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    326\r\n    Is our hold room for Monday. We are sold out Monday and Tuesday, yeah!!!!!\r\n\r\n    We got a nice review on Trip Advisor from one of the wedding guests a couple of weeks ago. Thank you all for your hard work. You rock!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2010 at 12:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of reminders:\r\n    First off, market chef is now open on Saturdays :)\r\n    Secondly, we need to all make sure that we leave confirmation numbers when we leave messages on the spa’s answering machine, so that we can locate the reservation that needs the treatments\r\n\r\n    I never received a clipper release report yesterday. I called them yesterday and today and left messages with the “person in charge” and am yet to hear back from them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2010 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    ASSISTANCE NEEDED\r\n    Khai, just a warning that the lady in 102 might need assistance getting from her room to the spa. She is in a wheelchair and she thinks she is going to need at least two people to get her down the hill. Her appointment is at 10:30 and she will call you in the morning if she needs help.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2010 at 2:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Room 108–lost a pair of jeans in the washer or dryer. Morgan let her finish up some laundry in housekeeping a few nights ago because it was late and now she can’t find a pair of her jeans, Joe’s Brand. I called housekeeping but they didn’t find anything. Please let her know if anything turns up #2435237.\r\n\r\n    There is money in an envelope on the back desk for Captain Maya from some guests who went on a whale watch cruise with him yesterday but didn’t know he couldn’t accept credit cards, he should be picking it up later today.\r\n\r\n    Brynn went to the bank and got us 20’s, 10’s, 5’s, 1’s …we were all out!!\r\n\r\n    Please make sure someone goes to Post San Juan on Monday to put the i-touch charger i8n the mail on the back counter, they are closed today.\r\n\r\n    Very hectic day! The phone never stopped ringing!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2010 at 8:04 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone,\r\n\r\n    Several things…room 334 is blocked out, a/c is not working properly. Room 336 is also blocked out, the water doesn’t seem to be working properly, Seth knows and will be fixing it hopefully today.\r\n\r\n    The back computer has a virus!! Please leave it off until Chris Teren gets here to fix it.\r\n\r\n    It’s gonna be another scorcher today…bring on the sunshine and heat!! A littler reminder from Cindy that we should be reminding guests as they book reservations that we do not have a/c in all of our rooms, this way we can avoid surprising guests by the lack of a/c in their room when they arrive (but all the rooms do currently have fans in them!)\r\n\r\n    Enjoy the beautiful weather everyone :)\r\n    Brynn Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM 336\r\n    Shower/tub heads are very finicky, the guest and I both played around with it but it was very difficult to make it work, plus hot water wasn’t happening. I moved him to room 337.\r\n\r\n    ROOM 334\r\n    AC troubles. Apparently it won’t stay on or get cool enough. Moved guests to room 306.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 12:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh soooooo busy on my last day!!! Totally overwhelmed!\r\n\r\n    The van. It’s back and running. Hooray.\r\n\r\n    Morgan- thank you for opening the windows for me. The cross-ventilation helps!\r\n\r\n    We need more pet registration forms. I’m looking for the document on the computer but haven’t found it yet. Will keep looking.\r\n\r\n    So today begins my maternity leave. But if anyone is desperate to have a shift covered and I haven’t yet gone into labor, then I might be able to help you out. So call me.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2010 at 10:30 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    Anyone know what is wrong with the 2 bikes over by Morgan’s? If so, please let Seth know.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 11:56 am\r\n\r\n    Thing that make you go hmmmmmm….\r\n\r\n    The key saga continues. No idea what is happening but keys are mysteriously not working. Seth said he would re-program the doors… but we both think the issue is with the key maker in the office. It reads that the keys are valid when they don’t actually work in the doors.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to say to the blogosphere that the washers are being finicky lately. Sometimes they work, sometimes they decide to eat a guest’s quarters. Not sure what this is all about.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2010 at 8:27 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys (Angela & Halley)…\r\n    Johnny is wondering if either of you took a message yesterday from a large group inquiring about the hours of the juice bar. (It wasn’t me and it wasn’t Morgan.) If so, do you have contact information? I couldn’t find a message anywhere.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2010 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hmmmm…..I think we’ve entered the Bermuda Triangle of keycards. Rm 314 is having major door lock issues and Seth is being wonderful and taking care of it. Also, the Wind Place keys weren’t working. I made 3 different sets and none worked. Then magically, they worked again. Just a ‘heads up’ for the next shift. :-)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    YOU DON’T HAVE MAIL\r\n    We seem to be having email difficulties again. I went all shift without receiving an email. I processed at least 10 online bookings and guests tried sending us stuff a couple times so I know we should be receiving. I tried restarting Outlook and the back computer to no effect. Be prepared for a possibly very full inbox in the morning.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Lovelies!\r\n    Miss Laura is also off to an adventure, so if you have any issues, call me at home.\r\n    Have a great week. Check out our new special Island Dazzle, uuhhhh!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 5:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi ALL~\r\n    Stephanie and Halley when you are working on Tuesday, can you please remove all the decorations? The outside ones as well. You can ask Raquel where she would like you to store them, not in the back luggage room though :) More than likely in the Cedar room..\r\n    Island Paper is coming tomorrow, and they are going to pick up 4 coffee makers we purchased from them for return, those coffee makers are in the Orca Storage, Raquel knows where they are.\r\n    I found a few reservations for the future that had not been charged the 10%, don’t forget to process that deposit, it helps you to know ahead of time if the credit card number is valid..\r\n    Stephanie, thank you for your thoughtfulness when you made your cupcakes for the 4th, you are so sweet.\r\n    The van is currently at the Lube Guy, Morgan knows the details..\r\n    There is a check on my desk for Raquel, she is picking up some shampoo for Bird Rock on Wednesday, can you make sure she gets the check Stephanie..\r\n    Speaking of Raquel, did you know she has a birthday on Friday.. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS RAQUEL… We love you..\r\n    I am going on a college adventure…. You can reach me on my cell.. or my email…..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2010 at 12:35 pm\r\n\r\n    PEPSI\r\n    left msg with Pepsi rep to please come and fix his machine.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2010 at 1:25 pm\r\n\r\n    PEPSI MACHINE IN BUILDING A\r\n    is out of order. We put a little sign up. I tried to call the Pepsi folks, no answer. Will try again tomorrow.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2010 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th everyone~Enjoy your weekend..\r\n\r\n    When you do a POS charge make sure that you only use the category Gift Shop Misc, for Gift shop items..\r\n    This will make it much easier for me when I am seeing how well our gift shop is doing..\r\n\r\n    See you at the parade..\r\n\r\n    :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2010 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy July 1st to all you fabulous people.\r\n\r\n    This is just a little love note to tell you how amazing each and every one of you are and how much I appreciate everything you do every single day. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there this weekend!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2010 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    So you know Western Prince’s orange zippy little zodiac boat? It’s called the “Western Explorer”… Anyway, did you know that the prices are different? Well, they are. They charge $99 for adults and $76 for children under 12.\r\n\r\n    Also, all passengers on the Western Explorer wear full “exposure protection suits” over their clothes. So if you book a guest on the Explorer, advise them not to wear anything too bulky. Light layers are recommended. A sweatshirt or light fleece would be appropriate. They also recommend close-toed shoes like sneakers. As Chris from WP said, “It’s a full experience!”\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2010 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    4TH OF JULY availability-\r\n    FYI…In case we need to refer anyone elsewhere for the night of the 4th, as of 2:42 on Tuesday Juniper Lane Guest House has her cabin available for the night of the 4th only. It is a little house w/ full kitchen and balcony that sleeps 4 comfortably. Rate is $199. Juniper’s number is: 378-7761\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2010 at 12:25 pm\r\n\r\n    RUN LADIES RUN\r\n    is hosting a ladies-only half marathon (13.1 miles) on October 17th, 2010… and we are offering a discount rate that weekend for anyone staying with us for the run. If they mention run ladies run, the rate is $99.\r\n\r\n    BooBoo dropped off flyers with info about the run- they’re under the wipe board by the swing gates. The backside of the flyers have a training log. Pretty handy for anyone wanting to train for this. Who’s in?!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 5:43 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW NEW NEW\r\n    There is a new company out of Roche that is offering private boat charters on a classic wooden motoryacht. They are called Choice Charters. They do not have a price sheet because they offer flexible trips that are catered to the guest’s specifications. They do say that they will be comparable to the average whale watching prices/trip times just to give you an idea. They can also do hors d’oeuvre catering and even an on-board seafood dinner. Everything is flexible. Brochures are over by the swing-gates.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 3:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Seth picked up the map paper today from Printonyx. Yay. Thanks, Seth!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2010 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Maloulas Restaurant\r\n    is now open all week except of Wednesday. Oh yummy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2010 at 6:01 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered map paper from Printonyx about 2 weeks ago. We are now completely out. I printed out some to use but we need to call Printonyx Monday morning to see if they have it completed yet. If so, we need to go get it. If not, we should see if they can print us off enough to get us by.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2010 at 12:56 pm\r\n\r\n    I ordered coffee from SJ coffee today…it should be delivered tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2010 at 3:00 pm\r\n\r\n    TESLA ELECTRIC SUPER CAR\r\n    This is exciting: on Saturday, July 3, the Tesla Motors company will come to Friday Harbor to introduce their new electric super car. What makes it super is the fact that you can drive it on the highway.\r\n    So from 10AM to 4PM people (guests, us, islanders) can sign up to take the thingy for a spin. Our property will be the staging area. I will get some more info on this soon. They are staying here with us.\r\n    Yeah for finding ways to get us less oil dependent!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    PRINTER TONER\r\n    Our front desk printer is low on toner. I put a replacement cartridge on my desk, so when the time comes, we don’t have to take the entire luggage room apart:)\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Please make sure to release the blocked out Clipper rooms when you input the reservations from the allocation.\r\n    Go to: Unit Closeouts, click on respective date, unclick arrows, save. The 4 closed out earth places per day are the clipper block.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation #2328908 thought they left a book and book mark in their room, I went back and checked and housekeeping checked, there was no book/bookmark in the room. The guests will be coming back by here in a few days to check and see if we found it, please let them know we did not.. :(\r\n    I feel summer…..\r\n    Enjoy..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2010 at 2:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    From now on Raquel or Regino are going to give us a call everyday around 1:00pm so that we have an update on which rooms are clean for that one-something ferry arrival.\r\n    Yay :)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2010 at 8:13 am\r\n\r\n    Hey front deskers (that doesn’t sound right)…\r\n    Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that last week I went kayaking with Crystal Seas as they invited me to go… and promised I would fit in the kayak. (And I did!) It was a blast.\r\n\r\n    I highly encourage you to take the opportunity to go out with a kayak tour to experience first hand what it is like. You might already be well aware that most of the companies will extend an invitation to us Earthboxers (that also does not sound right) and a guest to go for free as long as they have room. Go now before the season gets too busy! It’s so much easier to talk to guests about the kayak tours if we’ve experienced it ourselves.\r\n\r\n    If you want to read more about my experience and see pics, you can check out my blog post about it. (of course I blogged about it!) Right here: http://twoyearsonanisland.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/paddling-and-pregnant-at-35-weeks/\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 9:10 pm\r\n\r\n    With warmer weather coming, just wondering: Are we getting fans for the rooms with no AC? Had a guest call and ask how to turn on the air in Bldg A. “Room is stuffy.”\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 8:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest Laundry: The first washer continues to eat quarters and NOT produce service. Morgan was able to get it working earlier, but another guest lost his coins. :-( Left work order for Seth.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 1:34 pm\r\n\r\n    The pillow question has been answered and the pillows have been picked up. Bye, bye pillows!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2010 at 11:18 am\r\n\r\n    A guest ordered pillows from us and was wondering if they had come in. Does anyone know if they have?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2010 at 4:37 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER UPDATE\r\n    Soooooooo, Cindy and I conferred and decided the nightly booking report has too many ways for us to mess up, especially if they won’t even cancel previously made reservations.\r\n    As of today: we will disregard the nightly booking report. We will use the Allocation Release only to make our Clipper bookings. This means we need to pay extra super attention to the Allocation Release, but if we do (and we will!) everything should be fine.\r\n    BUT: please continue to look for Clipper reservations by name before you make new ones, because we may have them on the books already from previous nightly booking reports.\r\n    ALSO: continue to look at the nightly booking reports for cancellations.\r\n\r\n    Again, please ask Morgan or I if you have any questions. Thanks for staying tuned.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2010 at 4:30 pm\r\n\r\n    iPod Docks\r\n    Well it seems like we have some new iPod docks set up in Building D and E. If people need adapters for different models of ipod they are in a bag, in the drawer in the back desk above the pet registration forms.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2010 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER PART XXXCCVCCIIIIIIII\r\n    Hokay. Just when we thought we got it all figured out, a new curve ball: if somebody cancels a Clipper booking within 6 days of the booking, Clipper doesn’t send us a cancellation on the nightly booking report, they just send the allocation release WITHOUT the canceled name on it. Great. So:\r\n    When you process your allocation report, release blocked out rooms, double check Clipper reservations already made, fax it back to them and then:\r\n    Please go to that day’s check ins and make sure there isn’t a Clipper reservation on our books, which didn’t show up on the allocation report. If there is, double check everything, and I mean everything, then cancel it.\r\n    Ask Morgan or I if you have any questions. Pay good attention to processing the Clipper reports, this is really important and can bite us hard if we mess up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2010 at 4:34 pm\r\n\r\n    334\r\n    Had dripping sound all night long and moved rooms. Please let Raquel know that room needs to be cleaned on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE ROOM\r\n    What’s up with the food and shrimp basket in the luggage room, anybody know? Also: big box of pillows with my name on it, I don’t know what that is and why they are there, why, I ask, why why why?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2010 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE ROOM\r\n    Morgan, Valerie, let’s organize the luggage room in the next few days. Put boxes on higher shelf, etc. It’s a date?\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2010 at 10:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Had quite a few compliments on our establishment this evening. A couple of folks came from Best Western and wanted to look at a room here for future visits. They were “blown away” by the grounds and loved the feeling here. Will definitely stay with us next time. Also, have a number of guests who came in to tell me specifically how much they enjoy staying at Earthbox. Yay!!!! Pretty sure we’ll get a few TripAdvisors….I gave them the website information. Oh, and one guest wanted me to tell Management that the website is ‘fabulous’!! Go us!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a heads up: A guest called requesting a fan while I had a bunch of folks in the lobby. It took a while for everyone to leave so I could shut down and go take one to him. Now, I swear the guest told me he was in 205 but when I showed up there, no one knew anything about needing a fan. So if the guest who actually needed the fan calls please offer my apologies for not getting it to him.\r\n\r\n    We really need to start getting fans into all the rooms for the season.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Ordered map paper.\r\n    stephanie Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2010 at 11:41 am\r\n\r\n    Aaaaaaaahhhh! Two Clipper groups checked in at the same time after arriving on the 10:35 ferry. Along with regular guests. Very hectic. I tried to make it as smooth as possible… but didn’t have much notice. They arrived earlier due to the Clipper breaking down. Hopefully they are happy :-)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2010 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER BROKE DOWN\r\n    All guests scheduled to go back to Seattle on the Clipper today, Sunday 6/13, are advised to check in at the Clipper booth at the Harbor between 3:45 and 4:00 where they will receive instructions about how to take the Washington State Ferry and a shuttle back to Seattle.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    EMERGENCY HOLD ROOMS\r\n    I blocked our 2 Earth Places every Friday and Saturday night through Labor day.\r\n    On Friday mornings:\r\n    if we aren’t sold out, release the 2 rooms for Friday only\r\n    On Saturday morning:\r\n    if we aren’t sold out release the 2 rooms for Saturday\r\n\r\n    If we are close to sold out, release one room per day.\r\n\r\n    If we are sold out release one room mid day (around 4PM), keep the second one until most of our check-ins are here, (around 7 or 8PM). If things look good around 6 and you get folks asking if we have availability, you may say, that you have an emergency room you will release around 7 or 8 and ask the guest to call back (or take down her number and call her).\r\n\r\n    Please ask Cindy, Morgan or I if you aren’t sure how to properly release blocked out rooms.\r\n\r\n    Rock’n Roll, Summer here we are!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Mistakes where made…..Please pay extra special super mega very intense attention to the daily booking report and the release allocation report. Especially to:\r\n\r\n    how many nights:\r\n    that was our problem tonight, sold out, but had a Clipper staying 2 nights not 1\r\n\r\n    guests currently enjoying your establishment:\r\n    those are multiple night stays and do not require a new reservation for today’s date\r\n\r\n    status: new or canceled\r\n\r\n    Steph, Morgan, Lilly and I went over this. Steph will triple quadruple check upcoming Clipper reservations on Monday.\r\n    After that no more excuses. If we are over booked and the paper has your initials, you will take the guests home and cook them a nice dinner:)\r\n    Onward!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2010 at 10:09 am\r\n\r\n    DOWN BEDDING ALLERGY…\r\n    Just found out from Raquel that our bedding in SKY PLACE rooms has down in it. A couple of guests checked in early today but needed hypo-allergenic bedding and I didn’t know to check with Raquel on that first. She said that any time we have guests with a down allergy, she needs to change all the bedding to accommodate them so to check with her first.\r\n\r\n    So- while the guests waited, Raquel (like a rockstar) changed the bedding for them.\r\n\r\n    We should probably always put a note in the housekeeping line when the guest is allergic to down and check with Raquel/Regino first to make sure that the room is ready before checking anyone in. Sorry, Raquel!\r\n    Steph\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2010 at 3:12 pm\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Starting June 20th Western Prince has a new schedule for their tours.\r\n\r\n    The big boat (Western Prince II): 2PM daily + an added tour on Fridays, Saturdays & Sundays 10:30 AM.\r\n\r\n    The Zodiac (Western Explorer): 11 & 3 daily\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 9:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Spring Street School may need the conference room on Thursday afternoon if it rains for the 8th grade promotion. They will set up the conference room and clean it up (supposedly).\r\n    angela Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 4:07 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI: The number for Bob’s Taxi needs to be changed to 378-6777 on our “important numbers” list. The old number goes to their office and not the driver.\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2010 at 9:51 am\r\n\r\n    MOPED\r\n    Susie dropped off a moped yesterday. It’s by the bikes. Whoever works the closing shift will need to bring the moped into the pool area and lock it up. The opening shift person will then need to bring it out and set it up by the bikes in the morning.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The spa is now open at 9AM, FYI.\r\n\r\n    SLUG\r\n    There was a slug in the lobby this morning. A big one. Just saying hello. Probably looking for his little 6 1/2 year old friend who is a guest here and loves slugs.\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2010 at 4:05 pm\r\n\r\n    IDEA: maybe we should check to be sure the new TV Guides are correct. :-)\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2010 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi: I put almost all of the TV Guides in the rooms. (and removed the old guide from every book while inserting the new one) But….there were a couple of rooms that I didn’t get to and I left a note on the stack of extra TV Guides. Sorry I only remember 110 was one of them.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    TV GUIDES\r\n    Had another 2 rooms with the incorrect TV guide in the guest folder. Who put the TV guides in the rooms? Did you miss rooms? Any recollection on which rooms might not have the correct one?\r\n    Khai, Angela if you guys aren’t busy tomorrow, can you go into our open rooms and check that each guest directory has\r\n    - spa menu\r\n    - TV Guide (the one which starts with “02 CNN, 03 Headline News”, if there are 2 TV guide throw out the incorrect one)\r\n    - Back Door Kitchen menu\r\n    Then write on a property map which rooms are good and let the next shift know? Angela and Lilly, can you continue this the next day?\r\n    Thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n    For those of you who had to endure me going on and on and on about my landlord and the construction at my house: the landlord o.k.ed my request for some $$ off the rent, yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER SOME MORE\r\n    Hokay. We need to read the nightly booking reports more closely(not the one we fax, but the one which shows reservations and cancellations made during the last 24 hours). We missed a cancellation this weekend. So: highlight the booking status on the nightly booking report. When making a Clipper reservation make sure it says: NEW, not CANCELED. Sounds so easy, but we all missed it.\r\n    Further: when making a booking for a future Clipper reservation, make sure you release one of the rooms blocked out for Clipper on that day.\r\n\r\n    Eyes wide open, brain on, big smile on your face, t’is the season. We all feel the stress. But we can do this. We have all the tools we need (and if you don’t, you’ll let me know, deal?), we have a killer crew this year. You are all loved and appreciated. Together we are strong.\r\n    Onward!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 10:36 am\r\n\r\n    WORK TIME:\r\n\r\n    Cindy and I aren’t getting enough of it (work time, that is)…\r\n\r\n    As of today, we are now officially the BACK OFFICE OGRES. From 12:30 to 2:30 every week day, Cindy and I will be closing our doors and silencing our phones. Please don’t knock on our doors unless the building is burning down. If any body comes asking for us, please let them know we are not available.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    BICICLETAS\r\n    Just a reminder to please make sure to lock up all the bikes so they don’t end up taking a joy ride by themselves.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2010 at 8:35 am\r\n\r\n    LAUNDRY-\r\n    I JUST saw Cindy’s note about the first shift person needing to open the laundry room and prop open the door. I had a guest first thing ask to get in and I called Raquel (but she wasn’t here yet. Oops.) I will add the laundry room door into my morning opening routine.\r\n\r\n    ONE PROBLEM THOUGH… Raquel said that a guest was able to access the laundry room and did laundry at 11 PM the other night. How do we make sure that doesn’t happen?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2010 at 2:20 pm\r\n\r\n    CHECKS\r\n    We don’t take personal checks as payment. Cash, credit cards and Traveler’s checks only.\r\n\r\n    BUSINESS ACCOUNTS\r\n    We have accounts at Island Bikes and ACE, no need to pay with cash.\r\n\r\n    INITIAL\r\n    Please initial paid out receipts and write why the paid out was made (if it isn’t obvious).\r\n\r\n    Yep, you guessed it, I’m reconciling money:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2010 at 12:24 pm\r\n\r\n    TO OUR MARATHON RUNNING GUESTS:\r\n    You are rockstars! When the rains were coming down this morning and the winds were howling, I would have made a b line to the hot tub, but not you guys. You ran. I’m proud of you.\r\n\r\n    TO MORGAN:\r\n    Thank you so much for the excellent food yesterday. The home made pickles were a real treat and my 6 foot burger, well, for once I finally got enough meat. Thank you.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2010 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    We still have a guy from the SJ Golf Classic who never showed up…he was supposed to check in yesterday but didn’t show up and we saw no sign of him today. His invoice is on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    The stack of invoices on the back desk is for the Abbott group that had 6 rooms…they split their bill 13 ways so we have their receipts that they requested. They’re checking out tomorrow so if they don’t ask for their receipts just recycle them.\r\n\r\n    Clipper no-show #2292103…hmmmm.\r\n\r\n    Pretty quiet night, lots of people taking bikes out! What a beautiful sunny day…we’ve been waiting for this!\r\n\r\n    We’ve got several late checkouts tomorrow 6/6 because of the marathon and half marathon.\r\n\r\n    Thanks again for the yummy food Morgan :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2010 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    AIRCONDITION\r\n    Our Earth Places do NOT have air condition, neither do our Sky Places. Our Water Places and Sun Places do have air condition. This info is also in the room descriptions in WRP or when a guest makes an online booking.\r\n\r\n    INVOICES BACK DESK\r\n    There are a ton of invoices on the back desk. Why?\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    When checking the allocation release forms (the ones you fax) please do a search for each guest name on the form and make sure a reservation hasn’t been made already. Gracias!\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Thank you so much for covering for me yesterday. I owe you a favor:)\r\n    They took my house apart and installed a heating system (started to install I should say). It took me all night to clean up after them and put our rooms back together, aaaahhhhh.\r\n\r\n    What a fabulicious day on the island, sun, whales, baby foxes, smiling guests, it’s summer!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2010 at 10:39 pm\r\n\r\n    The t-shirts are actually all put away. they look great, Lil!\r\n\r\n    324 is dirty, please make sure housekeeping gets in there\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Yay, Angela and I got a big chunk of the t-shirts folded and tagged. I will continue working on organizing and putting them out tomorrow when I am here. Other than that, a pretty slow night. Finally we had a sunny day though!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Each front desk employee gets (2) blue shirts up here at the Earthbox. Please let me know when you pick up your (2)..\r\n    Also, if you are the opening shift of the day, please take your all access card and open the guest laundry and prop open the door..:)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 11:34 am\r\n\r\n    SUMMER ATTIRE\r\n    The new bright blue EarthBox t-shirts are in and they’re very cheery. Be sure to get yours on your next shift as the blue t-shirts are replacing the black for our front desk summer attire.\r\n\r\n    My ‘bun in the oven’ is much more obvious in the new blue shirts than the black ones. (Just thought you’d like to know.) Putting the blue shirt on made me feel instantly more summery. Okay, I’ll stop now. Got some shirts to tag and fold.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    WOW, I am so happy we can blog again, it feels like we are all connected. :) The sun is SO beautiful this morning, I even opened my sun roof..\r\n    What a weekend we have coming up, Celebrity Golf Classic, SJ Marathon, and many more fun things to do…\r\n    Enjoy…..\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2010 at 7:56 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    The sun is shining. Hallelujah!\r\n\r\n    LOBBY CLEANLINESS\r\n    This morning I had to clean chewing gum off of the desk next to the guest computer. Gross. Who does that?! Anyway… the lobby was, well, not spic and span overall. I think the rain storm yesterday left it’s mark… it needed a good vacuuming. Done and done.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    We had a guest calling earlier, very upset that they couldn’t find NBC on the TV and were missing the hockey game. I tried to help them out but couldn’t find an accurate channel guide, (the one’s in the back are incorrect) and she didn’t have one in the room either…do we have them anywhere or should new channel guides be made?\r\n\r\n    Not a very busy night, everyone is scared away from this place because of the rain!! Hopefully our summer weather will be here asap :)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    SPA RATES\r\n    Hey guys, just discovered an error where someone charged a guest only $85 for a prenatal massage… actual price is $95. Please double check massage treatment prices when processing vouchers for guests. Thanks! (this is a reminder for me too!)\r\n    Stephanie Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2010 at 10:49 am\r\n\r\n    No Kayaking Today.\r\n    Icky weather… winds on the water have canceled all kayak trips today. Bummer for the guests who were here specifically to kayak. Word is they’ll be going out tomorrow as the weather looks to be better.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2010 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL TOWELS\r\n    Hi folks, as you are not doubt aware we are painfully low on pool towels. If we are out in the pool house, take them off the shelves in housekeeping. If there are no more in housekeeping, you can take them off the shelves in the building A housekeeping closets. Try to avoid taking them off the carts. Thank you!\r\n    Brynn Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2010 at 1:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Raquel has blocked out room 330 for at least today because of a bad smell. Hmmm.\r\n\r\n    It’s been a fairly calm day for Lilly and I so far…and it looks like we have a slight break from rain. Let’s hope!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2010 at 6:29 pm\r\n\r\n    WT…….????????\r\n    Today 2 ferries broke down. The morning sailing and the 4 something sailing was canceled. Seriously? This weekend?\r\n\r\n    So fare so good. Had one reservation call in frustration to ask to get out of their booking since they have to spend their vacation in the Anacortes ferry terminal and sold their room 10 minutes later.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The Spa called and asked for ways we could insure we have the correct massage reservations for the correct dates on the books. We had some glitches. So, when you make a massage reservation, make sure to repeat the time and date after each booking. Also note with whom you spoke at the spa. We might institute something like a call before each big weekend to double check our bookings. Ideas anybody?\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2010 at 10:05 am\r\n\r\n    Res. #1975425 canceled her room for this Sunday but apparently no one told her about the cancellation policy when she booked almost 6 months ago. Let’s try to resell her room…even though we aren’t sold out. She will call in the morning and if we couldn’t resell her room then she will just keep the room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2010 at 6:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n    when switching shifts, please make sure you are not going into overtime (just yet). If it seems like there is no other way, please talk to Cindy and I first. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    AAA BATTERIES\r\n    We need some in a bad way. Please go to Ace tomorrow and get some for the weekend. Cindy, can you order us some bulk someplace?\r\n\r\n    215\r\n    Is the only room on the property which doesn’t have a remote control (there is none for that type of TV). Cindy ordered a replacement TV, should be here soon.\r\n\r\n    Happy Memorial Day weekend, everybody. Summer Season 2010 here we come!!!!\r\n    Angela Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2010 at 6:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Western Prince is running a 4pm Whale Watch Tour on Sat and Sunday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2010 at 3:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi All!\r\n    Just a reminder that we need to make sure everyone remembers to check the requests field when they are processing online reservations. I discovered a couple of reservations for this weekend that had requests for kayaking and/or whale watching trips. You need to make sure you take care of those or at the very least make an alarm so we are aware of it. Thank you all!!!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2010 at 9:09 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Daylight savings time! Set your clocks forward.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2010 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    I wonder if this will get deleted….\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2010 at 8:59 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub is refilled and heating. It will probably be fully ready to reopen late afternoon Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 4th, 2010 at 1:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Hally & Morgan!\r\n    Have a happy shift!\r\n    Got 2 jobs for you:\r\n    1) Please take the letter sized Back Door Kitchen menus and put them in all of our guest rooms. Place in the guest directories after the page explaining the room service. Thank you.\r\n    2) Please make spa vouchers.\r\n    Call me at Brrrr if you need anything. Miss you!\r\n\r\n    Also: our elevator is still out of order, but we have promises from the amazing elevator fixer that it will be repaired before April when our Exploritas groups start coming.\r\n\r\n    And: one of our guest will arrive around 2PM tomorrow and will need a ride from the ferry. Please call Regino for a pick up when the guest calls.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2010 at 12:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello, hello!\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY 3/2\r\n    Seth will work on the hot tub. It will be out of order for 3 days. Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Sasha from Back Door will drop off their menus soon. Please put in my box. I will place them in guest directories shortly and then it’s ON with the room service for the season, yeah!!! Do you all remember how to do this?\r\n    1) Guest will call Back Door to place order\r\n    2) Back Door will call us for pick up\r\n    3) We will pick up food, place on tray with silverware, plates, napkins (we don’t plate the food, just bring the to-go boxes on the tray)\r\n    4) Add food bill plus 15% to guest’s invoice\r\n    5) Bring food to guest’s room. Have guest sign invoice.\r\n    6) Charge guest’s cc or make change for cash and bring back to guest if applicable\r\n    7) Put food bill with guest confirmation # in Cindy’s box for payment\r\n    Ask me if you have questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2010 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    MONDAY – ECOLAB\r\n    Morgan, the stuff Ecolap sent is in the Cedar room.\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    Our elevator isn’t working. That was a bummer for our 100ppl event. They had to un-invite their handicapped guests. We got to make sure that we know these things beforehand.\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR\r\n    We got a great review. Check it out!\r\n\r\n    Oh it’s wonderful here tonight. Everybody is just beaming with the sun out like this. It’s like summer, busy, lot’s of kids and puppys(the dachshund beagle mix is my favorite). Thanks you, happy guests!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2010 at 12:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning sweet staff people!\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY\r\n    We have a group in the conference center. They will have a fund-raising dinner on Saturday, and will set up for it on Friday. They’ll arrive around 3 and will need table cloths. Raquel had all table cloths ironed and they are in the conference center already. It’s Raquel’s day off, so please call Regino with questions.\r\n\r\n    MONDAY\r\n    Eco-lab will be here first thing on Monday morning (7:40AM ferry) to install some equipment in the laundry rooms of both hotels. Morgan, will you be there at 8AM please, open the laundry room for them and drive some equipment to Bird Rock in our truck, please?\r\n\r\n    Also: I blocked out building E Monday and Tuesday. Seth will caulk the bath tubs. Just so you know.\r\n\r\n    WONDERFUL BOSS LADIES\r\n    Cindy will be back next Thursday. Laura will be back the week of March 1. Please let people know and ask if I can help them with anything. If you need me call me, no matter where you are, no matter how far, just call my name …… well, it probably works better if you call my phone.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2010 at 2:08 pm\r\n\r\n    THE CINDY PROJECT\r\n    Hey Morgan, Halley and Khai. Cindy left a project on my desk: labeling the 2010 file folders. I don’t know what the task is, but each of you does. Will you please work on this and get’er done before Cindy comes back? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 12th, 2010 at 7:48 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Made more spa vouchers. We were completely out. There are more to assemble. Have at it if you have time.\r\n\r\n    HOLE PUNCHER\r\n    Jan borrowed our 3 hole puncher over the weekend, just so you know.\r\n\r\n    DER HIMMEL UEBER BERLIN\r\n    I watched “Wings of Desire” by Wim Wenders last night again for the first time since it came out in 1987. It was the first movie filmed in the death stripe (the stripe between the West wall and the East wall). The East German government had never allowed that before. It really touched me, seeing the city before the wall came down, seeing Germany period. I guess I’m a little homesick. Anyway, if you are in an artsy tone poem mood, and want to check out what angels feel and long for, this is your movie.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, Seth, and Raquel for working so hard to get everything ready. Both properties look great. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    needs a tidy, please. Guests moved to different building.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 4:25 pm\r\n\r\n    F3\r\n    Please know that we don’t expect you to remember everything we blog about, you just have to know how to find it: press F3 to search the blog for keywords. Having said that:\r\n\r\n    We have new and exciting Spring specials (2/15 -3/31/10).\r\n\r\n    PEACE\r\n    Book a room at regular rate and we’ll donate $10 to Habitat for Humanity to build shelter for our fellow islanders in Haiti.\r\n    All you need to do is select that special if a guest wishes to. The boss ladies will tally and donate. IMPORTANT: do not select that special if you give a guest a discount.\r\n\r\n    LOVE\r\n    $20 off any Lavendera Day Spa treatment if you book a room at regular rate.\r\n    Book room, book spa treatment of guest’s choice as you would in any other case.

We will pay spa their regular\r\n    rate.\r\n\r\n    HAPPINESS\r\n    Selected rooms (Earth, Sky, Water) for $99 plus tax per night. Can’t be combined with other specials.\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2010 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    LISTS LISTS LISTS\r\n    I updated the front desk daily check-list (in folder on back desk). Please fill one out every shift and put in my box.\r\n\r\n    POOL POOL POOL\r\n    One of the new things on the list is: turn off outside pool lights in chem room (chem room key in safe).\r\n    Also: Morgan, can you please fill the hot tub every morning and keep an eye out on how much water evaporates? And please turn off bathroom lights in pool every night.\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    If our spa fills up over this weekend, please refer guests to Spa de Bune. They will be open Sat and Su.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 10th, 2010 at 4:45 pm\r\n\r\n    LOVE LOVE LOVE\r\n    I’m in romance package heaven, yeah! When you get back to work, please go through all upcoming reservations and make sure I didn’t forget anything, please.\r\n\r\n    SPA SPA SPA\r\n    The spa has a fantastic special this weekend: EVERY treatment comes with rose pedal foot soak and chocolates, wow! Please let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    MORE CHOCOLATE\r\n    I picked up an extra box of chocolates from SJ coffee today in case we get a last minute request. It’s by the champagne.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    February 6th, 2010 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Steffi-\r\n    2066077 had some loud dogs. I couldn’t get a hold of them on any of their numbers. Left multiple messages. You might want to have housekeeping check for damage in their room. Also, I had to move 2010020 rooms because of the dogs barking and scratching at the door.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I got all the labels printed but I couldn’t find anymore folders. The labels that are left are on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, everything else was all good.\r\n    See you guys when I get back from Costa Rica!!\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 4th, 2010 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello, Hello!\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, for switcherooing the computer screens. And thank you for your Earthbox art on the chalk board. The leaves on the tree are little “e’s”, wow.\r\n    Can you please laminate our business licenses and put in Cindy’s box, please? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    SPARKLING LOBBY COUNTER\r\n    The lobby counter needs another day to set. Please have our guests sign their invoices on a folder or the coffee table. Don’t put things on the counter until Saturday or Seth will kick you in the chin.\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    Somebody will rent the conference center for next Wednesday tomorrow. I think for a cosmetics thingy. She will bring by a check. I quoted $50.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    If you are bored, please make vouchers and pet policy envelopes. Also go through the voucher folder and make sure we have current vouchers and voucher logs. I spoke to Brian from SJO. He will not raise prices this year, haven’t heard from the others yet.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Did you know that San Juan Coffee, which we serve in both of our hotel lobby’s is fair trade and organically grown by small family farms. They are so small that they can’t afford the organic certification, but it’s ethically, environmentally and taste bud wise excellent coffee.\r\n\r\n    VALENTINE’S\r\n    Is just around the corner. Remember last year when there was not a seat in any restaurant to be had? Let our guests know to make dinner reservations early. Here’s what’s open:\r\n    Vinnie’s – special menu\r\n    COHO – set menu, $35 per person\r\n    BLUFF – special menu\r\n    McMillan’s – regular menu + set menu for $45 per person\r\n    Downriggers – set menu\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend everybody. Let’s blog a lot, because we don’t see each other very often these days.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2010 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Sweeties!\r\n    Welcome back to work, kind of, well, yeah.\r\n\r\n    GUEST DIRECTORIES\r\n    Guess who has updated guest directories in each room? We do! Yeah! Check out the one on my desk, so you know what our guests see.\r\n\r\n    FEMA APPROVED\r\n    Guess who is FEMA approved for Federal Employees? We are! What does that mean? Federal employees, when traveling officially, must stay in FEMA approved facilities. So if a guest asks if we are, we are. Our FEMA number is on my pin-board.\r\n\r\n    BROCHURES\r\n    We got some cool new brochures, from the whale trail folks and a scuba diving map. Check them out.\r\n\r\n    LIL JOB FOR KHAI\r\n    Can you please copy and laminate our master licenses (on my desk) and put in Cindy’s box?\r\n\r\n    LIL BIGGER JOB FOR MORGAN\r\n    Can you please take the computer screen in the luggage room and install it on the Bird Rock front desk computer. Bring the one at Bird Rock back up here and connect it to our server. And take the server one and put it in the luggage room with a sticky note, saying: Chris T.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you. Call me at home if you have any questions or issues. Have fun, be kind and excellent!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2010 at 10:20 am\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n\r\n    FYI: The Mullis Center puts out a discount book that offers discounts to island businesses. We are going to be included in there for 10% off. To get this discount, guests will need to provide the tear out sheet from the book.\r\n\r\n    p.s. The book has lots of great deals in it, you can buy one for $20, too!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2010 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    Testing.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 3rd, 2010 at 1:02 pm\r\n\r\n    GLITTER IS FOREVER\r\n    Thanks, Khai and Morgan for taking down all the decorations. Boy, that glitter sure is persistent, ain’t it?\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    Can you bring the toy on the back desk to Post San Juan tomorrow, please? There is a little boy in Seattle waiting for it:)\r\n\r\n    Have a pleasant month off. I’ll call you the last week of January with the new schedule. Please call me at home if you have any scheduling requests for the first 2 weeks of February.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for a great season and all your hard work. Love you all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2009 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    STEALING CHRISTMAS\r\n    Alright, it’s official. On Saturday 1/2/10 we will take the Christmas decoration down in the lobby. Please put everything neatly away in the boxes in the back. Seth will remove the tree that day as well.\r\n\r\n    BOOMTIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    When entering a boomtime GC into WRP, please know the GC buyer has been charged already. So simply input a gift certificate with the boomtime # as the confirmation number, the recipient as the guest name and write in the guest remarks: boomtime GC for bla bla $ from (buyer’s name), no restrictions, name, initial.\r\n    Then go to the payment screen and charge as a gift certificate the amount the GC is for.\r\n    Then, when submitting the reconciliation report to Cindy, highlight the GC charge (will show up as cash) and write “Boomtime” next to it.\r\n    Questions? Ask Cindy or I.\r\n    Happy chilly end of the year everybody.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 27th, 2009 at 9:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    I hope everyone had a wonderful christmas!\r\n\r\n    The guests from 314 moved to 309. Halley, could you have Raquel or Regino go check it out, make sure everything is clean. They weren’t in there long, but they said it smelled like someone had cooked in there recently and the scent still hadn’t left the room. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 24th, 2009 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh man, I would have loved to hear them. They didn’t sing for you? What kind of Christmas spirit is that?\r\n\r\n    SPA JETS\r\n    Dave ordered a part and we’ll have those jets fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    WATER HEATER BUILDING C\r\n    We got us a water heater for Christmas, yeah! Building C and the laundry room are back in business.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK COMPUTER\r\n    BR’s computer screen died this morning. As per Cindy I installed our server screen down there. The dead screen is in BR’s luggage room.\r\n\r\n    FELICITY\r\n    Brought us delicious homemade cookies. Check them out. I know I will.\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas Eve. Tonight at 8:00: “It’s a Wonderful Life”. Tonight at 8:08: Steffi starts weeping.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2009 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    “The German Club” came in to sing you Christmas carols, accordion and all. They asked for the women in the red jacket.. they were really disappointed when they saw that it was me here and not you. They said they would come back next year…\r\n\r\n    Merry Christmas everyone!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2009 at 6:19 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN, KHAILI & HALLEY\r\n    Apples of my eye, my front desk warriors, my team. I feel like a broken record saying this: I NEED you to COUNT the TILL when you work at night. This week we were under $45, last week it was $20. I can’t figure out what may have happened if I don’t know when it happened. If this happens again, I will write you up. I still love you, but I will.\r\n\r\n    SPA JETS\r\n    Morgan, they aren’t working. Can you have a look, please and blog about any tricks you may know?\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Either our water heater got delivered or Aliens have landed in front of building C. In which case you don’t have to count the till. Just run!\r\n\r\n    CHECK-INS CHRISTMAS\r\n    Khaili and Halley, will you please call all our check-ins for 12/24 and 12/25 and let them know our opening hours? Please write in the guest comment section that you called and what our guests said. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Will be leaving for Alaska tomorrow and will be gone for a week. Please call Cindy or I for maintenance issues. If it’s something minor, call Regino or DIY.\r\n\r\n    Also: count the till.\r\n\r\n    Happy beginning of Winter, everybody. Shortest day – check, and onward.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Kidding about the trip advisors… I just read the e-mail.\r\n    Oops :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2009 at 2:02 pm\r\n\r\n    There are two new trip advisor reviews.. check them out\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 17th, 2009 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    You are so welcome, Laura. What good is a cold boss, eh?\r\n\r\n    LA LUCE\r\n    Alrighty, we need to talk about light: below find all the plugs which need to be plugged in at 3:45PM every day to make Earthbox the Winter Wonderland it can be:\r\n    2 plugs on Morgan’s porch\r\n    1 plug outside 312\r\n    1 breaker by 5 mile sign\r\n    2 plugs in little outbuilding between 308 and 309\r\n    2 plugs by pool gate\r\n    1 plug on pool fence by 314\r\n    There will be a test on this on Monday, so study up!\r\n\r\n    MORGAN/HALLEY GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    Hey guys, I printed out a whole bunch of spa vouchers and gift certificates for both properties. Can you assemble them, please?\r\n\r\n    Oh, you know who has lived in the US of A for 13 years today? This girl! Thanks for having me.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 16th, 2009 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi and Daniel are my new superheros. What is their special power you may ask… Carrying wood. Yes, they saved this soon-to-be fire-starved woman. The dynamic duo brought and stacked an entire load of beautiful rounds under my deck yesterday. What a wonderful treat to come home to. Thank you for saving my back side!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 14th, 2009 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, thank you guys, for a pleasant evening. I’m still dreaming about the food. Morgan’s wings, Dave’s salmon and Pete’s duck were absolutely to die for. Thank you for the various song and dance performances (most of you missed the late night disco hour, uh BR girls, I love you!)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 14th, 2009 at 10:03 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a wonderful, cheerful Christmas party, the gift exchange was a hit….\r\n    I have ordered coffee for EB lobby.\r\n    Thank you Steffi and Morgan (and who ever else) for cleaning up after the party was over.. :)\r\n    There was snow at my house and then I came to town and it was gone, I think I will go back home….\r\n    Happy Monday..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2009 at 4:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Our new hot water heater that works the laundry room and building C and the conference room, will not be here until Friday the 18th at the earliest.. I have blocked out building C..\r\n    Don’t forget about the party on Sunday… Christmas is upon us..\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2009 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    336\r\n    The guys who moved from 314 to 336 today called and said they forgot a bag in 314. I went in there and couldn’t find it. Please let them know.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL is off tomorrow. Call her at home, if it’s important. Or better yet, call Regino or I.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 10th, 2009 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Our water heater died in building C:(\r\n    Moved all guests. 325 needs to be cleaned. Waiting for further instructions from the WBL’s (wonderful boss ladies).\r\n    Stay warm, everybody.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 10th, 2009 at 11:10 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Guys,\r\n\r\n    Long time, me no post.\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to give you guys a heads up for the busy season. I know, at this point, you’re wondering what busy season, that seems like so far away. But it will come again and when it does, we will need to refer to other properties.\r\n\r\n    Among the other great properties to whom we refer, I would like you to consider referring our guests to the Friday Harbor Suites when we are sold out. They will be referring back to us as well. Their units are quite lovely and they have water views. They are located above the Golden Triangle. Check out their website at http://www.sanjuanislandsuites.com and if you have time call them to see them up close and personal. Their telephone number is 317-6423.\r\n\r\n    These folks will be coming by to take a closer look at our properties as well. Please be your normal gracious selves.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    December 6th, 2009 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone!!!\r\n\r\n    I realized I haven’t written on here in ages, so I thought I’d give you all a little shout :)\r\n    Our hotel is so beautiful, many thanks to everyone who made it the winter wonderland it is! I love driving by it at night. I especially love our REAL Christmas tree in the lobby. Not many businesses can boast that, lol. It smells great.\r\n    HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!\r\n    -Halley\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 4th, 2009 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    INVALID CREDIT CARD\r\n    WRP has a new trick or tick, rather. Whenever you edit a reservation and save, it gives you the “invalid cc” error. It’s lying. The credit cards aren’t invalid. All you need to do is select what credit card type you got (visa, master, amex) and it lets you save.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2009 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s gorgeous out. I can’t believe it’s December. My rosebush at home is still making flowers and my tulips are coming. The latter I think will be in for a frosty surprise.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS CARDS\r\n    Morgan & Halley, please sign the Christmas cards on my desk.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS TREE\r\n    Comes on Saturday. Seth will put it up. Please decorate with ornaments from luggage room.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS DECORATING CONTEST\r\n    The judging is tonight. Wish us luck!\r\n\r\n    BOOMTIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    We don’t get them very often. They come via email and are already paid. Make a reservation in WRP, select “gift certificate only, room still available” in guest status, import recipient’s name, write in guest remarks “boomtime gift certificate, bla bla amount, no restrictions)”, charge bla bla amount as gift certificate, and – this is important – use boomtime gift certificate number as confirmation number (see sample on my pin board). Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    KHAI – THURSDAY 12/10\r\n    We cut that shift, so you won’t have to work that night. Good and bad, eh? Thanks for bearing with us during this time of the year.\r\n\r\n    THE MONEY$$$$$$$$\r\n    Please count the till at night. Every night. Please. Really. Just do it.\r\n\r\n    Happy B-day, Mia. Now you’re a pre-teen. Have a fabulous day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2009 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    Hope you all enjoyed your Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to note that the cash drawer was a little short tonight.\r\n\r\n    See you on Wednesday :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2009 at 10:34 am\r\n\r\n    Have a wonderful Thanksgiving everyone… I am thankful for all of you :) ..\r\n    Morgan can you carry on with putting the lights up in the windows inside the office :)\r\n    Gift shop purchases\r\n    When making a pos charge, and taking the payment, please make sure you only enter the amount of the sale, so for instance if it is for $15.25, and the guests give you a $20.00 don’t enter $20.00, enter the $15.25.\r\n    Cancellation fee\r\n    If a guest cancels and we have the 10% fee still on the reservation, make sure you go in and post a cancellation fee so that the account does not show a credit balance.\r\n    Thanks everyone, eat lots of TURKEY…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 24th, 2009 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB JETS\r\n    New hot tub jets button is ordered. Should be here next week. Until then, they do work, you just have to patiently, gently and softly push a couple of times.\r\n\r\n    Happy Thanksgiving everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2009 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB JETS\r\n    Yeah, it seems they might be going. Can we have them checked out? It’s frustrating for our guests and frustration is not what we want them to experience.\r\n    It stopped blowing, is that nice.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 23rd, 2009 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN SUNDAY 11/29\r\n    We will be closing Bird Rock on Sunday, 11/29. Dani will make breakfast for our guests and wish them farewell. Morgan, would you go down to Bird Rock and help Dani close the hotel that day, please? Alternately if you can’t get away, walk her through it, then go down there at shift change and do a final walk through. Thank you so much.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2009 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n\r\n    Couple of things. First, the hot tub jets were being fussy. Have Seth or Morgan check them out.\r\n    Second, there were dishes left in the sink in the Wind Place.. might want to let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    Goodnight!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2009 at 11:12 am\r\n\r\n    Beach Cruisers\r\n    We are going to move our beach cruiser (4 of them) into the maintenance shop, please remember to still offer them to our guests, the only difference will be you will have to walk up to maintenance to get them when they are requested.\r\n    Staff Christmas Party\r\n    December 13, 2009 @ 5:00pm, please bring yourself and family or friend to the Earthbox annual Christmas lobby party :) Bring your favorite appetizer and a gift ($15.00 spending limit) if you would like to participate in our gift game. Make sure the gift is unisex..\r\n    Cheers…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2009 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER MEETING\r\n    Somebody left their purse at the meeting tonight. The chamber of commerce people took it with them. If that person calls, please have her go to the Chamber to retrieve it.\r\n    Uh, Felicity let me try some of her hors d’oeuvres. She is a real artist, yummy.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2009 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    331\r\n    Has an electrical issue. See maintenance report. I blocked it out for a couple of days. Keep me posted.\r\n\r\n    Happy Fall of the Wall day (20 years, wow, I’m getting old).\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2009 at 12:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you Morgan for posting the new report that I would like you all to run every morning. With this wind it seems likely we may experience a lovely outage..\r\n    Kitchen\r\n    I have a simple request for cleaning~when you are on your shifts please remember to clean out the sink by the coffee maker,just remove the strainers and spray the sink with the bleach water bottle, also spray the strainers with cleaner, let it set for a while and then scrub out the sink and strainers with the sponge, the strainers get REALLY gross and this has to be done.. Remember to rinse the sponge good so it doesn’t get stinky..\r\n    Keys\r\n    Keep the little key cards organized. This does not take time and is easier to take a key out when they are all in order.\r\n    Money\r\n    Please make sure we have enough change during the week when you are on your shift, if we don’t have enough small bills feel free to walk over to the bank and change some big bills for little bills, also when you do this you can check to see if the money is all going the same way in the cash drawer, it makes it faster to take money out when it is organized.\r\n    So I am on a organized kick… So remember the small things..\r\n    Stay warm everyone.. Thanks for all the stuff you do and for listening to the little requests as well as the big ones..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2009 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE/NO INTERNET\r\n    In addition to what Morgan said below: call Laura. Between her lap top and her phone she most likely can access our reservation system.\r\n\r\n    WHEN RAQUEL CALLS AT NIGHT\r\n    What she wants to know is how many rooms are checking out and staying over the following day. She is not getting the correct info from us, which is frustrating for her. So, when she calls, please do the following in WRP:\r\n    1) go to tomorrows date\r\n    2) go to “check outs”, scroll to the bottom of the page, let her know how many there are\r\n    3) go to “check ins”, scroll to the bottom of the page and let her know how many “stay throughs” there are\r\n    4) Double check that you are really on tomorrow’s date, not today, not some other date, only tomorrow’s date.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Will serve their last supper of the season on December 19 and will re-open in mid February.\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    Somebody updated the event calender on our website for the holiday season. Mhm, who could that be? Check it out. Let me know if you know of an event I have missed.\r\n\r\n    Happy blowy night.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2009 at 10:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SUMMER IN NOVEMBER\r\n    We have a soccer team staying here tonight. It is so lovely to see all those kids get excited about everything, ferry, rain, pizza, the pool (”I don’t want to have dinner, I want to go swimming”). I never consciously thought about this, but as soon as the season is over, we don’t have little guests anymore, babies and puppies and adults only. Not that I don’t love our baby, puppy and adult guests, but it is lovely to have a night of summer kid energy. Thank you, soccer team. And a good game to you, tomorrow.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2009 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all,\r\n\r\n    Seeing as we are getting into the stormy season and power/internet can quickly become unreliable, we need to start printing out the day’s check-in receipts. It’s quite easy. Just go to the check-ins page and at the top of the screen you will see a link that says, “Print day’s PDF receipts.” Hit that, it’ll think for a sec, then print off one copy of the pages it displays. Simple. If you have questions please ask.\r\n\r\n    Laters!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 4th, 2009 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello!\r\n\r\n    Not really anything to report, just thought you guys might like to see a pointless blog post from me..ooookay, see you on Sunday :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2009 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BIRD ROCK BIRD ROCK\r\n    Until Thursday:\r\n    Please don’t forget to answer the phone: “Earthbox & Birdrock, this is bla bla, how can I help you?” when the 5800 number rings (make sure you say “Bla Bla” and not your real name, for security reasons).\r\n    Bird Rock’s emails come to our inbox (thanks Mo). They are flagged purple. Please answer them.\r\n    Please check Bird Rock’s WRP several times per day for new bookings. If we have new bookings for Thursday, please call guest and let them know that the hotel will open at 1PM and let Cindy or Laura know (some rooms down there have yet to be cleaned and if we get bookings for Thursday we need to arrange for housekeeping) (did you want to know all this?) (there is more) (there is always more) (just ask)\r\n    On Thursday:\r\n    Please change email settings so Bird Rock’s emails stop coming here (instructions on pin-board above my desk).\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    S out\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2009 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    A guest checked in to 334 and then moved to 306 because they decided they wanted to bring their dog into their room. I marked 334 as dirty, just want to make sure housekeeping gets to it.\r\n\r\n    314 has three robes, Morgan, can you make sure they are left in there?\r\n\r\n    That’s all for tonight, hope everyone had a good Halloween!\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2009 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys-\r\n\r\n    It was my first night closing, I hope everything was up to par. It was kind of crazy with walk ins and such. Also, a guy dropped off the coffee for the rroms. I left the invoice in the box and put it in our back room, is this what I should have done? Have a great day,openers!\r\n\r\n    -Halley\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot tub is warming up… Yah… It should be ready by Saturday AM..\r\n    It is suppose to get windy so hang on….\r\n    Have a great weekend..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2009 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    I made a holiday restaurant schedule this evening. I put one in Cindy’s basket and one in the basket on the back desk.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, no new to pass on.\r\n    Hope you all have a good rest of the week.\r\n    See you on Saturday.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 27th, 2009 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n\r\n    The man from SJ Coffee dropped off the coffee and installed a new filter. Yay for clean water!\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I apologize.. I forgot to count the money on Sunday.\r\n\r\n    I also didn’t take out the trash tonight because it wasn’t even a quarter full.\r\n\r\n    We received a great e-mail from a guest this evening. Goooo Morgan! Check it out.\r\n\r\n    Have a good morning, Halley. See you in the afternoon!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 6:44 pm\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Is ordered.\r\n\r\n    TILL\r\n    Please count the till every night.\r\n\r\n    WINE OPENERS\r\n    We don’t have any. Can you please ask Raquel if she retrieved some from the rooms? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BENIDO CHAVEZ\r\n    What a great name. He will call for a room, in connection with a Legion event on 11/14. Please give him our lowest midweek queen room rate.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n\r\n    The weather is wild, sun, rain, sun, rain. I like it. Also love the guest contact we can have now, in the off season. I had such good chats all night. Thank you, lovely guests.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 11:16 am\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Rob has ordered the new pump, it may be here today.. I will keep you posted.\r\n    Thanks so much for starting those courtesy calls, I think this will really help in making sure our guests get everything there little hearts desire during their stay with us. :) Remember all the details matter..\r\n    Happy Monday,\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 26th, 2009 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    Domestic Violence Fundraiser Event discount. We are offering a 20% off discount to anyone attending this event, guests should know to ask for that discount by name.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Courtesy calls are fun.\r\n\r\n    Everything went well today, nothing to report.\r\n\r\n    See you on Tuesday!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2009 at 4:47 pm\r\n\r\n    COURTESY CALLS\r\n    As of yesterday, we are calling our guests in their room about 15 minutes after they checked in. We ask if everything is fine, if they need anything and if they are comfortable. Afterward we write a quick note in the guest comment section in WRP, stating that we made that call, what the guest response was, date and initial. It’s great fun, check it out.\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Is broken. Please apologize to our guests. We’ll fix this as soon as we can. Rob will stop by tomorrow and have a look. If we need parts they will need to be ordered on Monday.\r\n\r\n    KHAI\r\n    You better come out of that room and show me your homecoming dress. I’m on pins and needles here, girl! Have fun, Sweety!\r\n    A woman named Allison will stop by tomorrow to check out the conference center for a possible yoga retreat. Please show her around. She and her friend may stay the night. Give her a good deal, please.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 23rd, 2009 at 3:20 am\r\n\r\n    Boy, I am starting to think you’re right Khai, the odd stuff only happens when I’m working.\r\n\r\n    Ok. Had to move the folks in 118 because water was leaking in pretty steadily from the back corner of the room near the fridge. Water had pooled enough to make it all the way to the front door. It thankfully mostly kept to the right side of the room. The poor folks would have probably woken up to a lake if their dog hadn’t made some noise. I moved them to 116 so please let Housekeeping know they will have to do a big clean on that room once they are out. I laid down a bunch of old pool towels to try and contain the water. I wasn’t sure what else to do. Please make sue Seth knows about the problem first thing so he can deal with it. Hopefully the floor isn’t damaged. I left alarms and blocked out the room through the 7th. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2009 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a fabulous staff meeting today.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Khai, money is all good. I think Seth took some money to get a repair done, and tonight I had a receipt and all the cash. Thank you for noticing:)\r\n\r\n    333 & 310\r\n    Need to be cleaned. Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    I like the new lights along the back fence by the spa, very classy.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    October 21st, 2009 at 9:27 pm\r\n\r\n    There are three new keys in the cupboard for the conference room.Thank you Cindy.\r\n\r\n    The cash drawer was off this evening. I didn’t take any cash today, I’m not sure what happened. I filled out the sheet though, Steffi you might want to take a look.\r\n\r\n    Laura and the girls were busy out by the pool carving lots of pumpkins :) Crazy that it is almost Halloween!\r\n\r\n    See you all tomorrow at the meeting\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 21st, 2009 at 3:09 pm\r\n\r\n    A man named Dan Kahn called about getting a room for tomorrow but wanted to know first if we had feathers in our bedding. I told him I’d need to put him on hold so I could ask Cindy but he was in a hurry and just said he’d call or walk in tomorrow when he gets to the island. I told him we had multiple water rooms available. Also, a woman named Patricia Manly called to check rates and wants to stay in a sky place 0n 11/10/09 for 1 or 2 nights but had to check with her husband before booking. She’ll call back and just wanted me to leave a note for the front desk staff so they’d know her when she called. Anyways, rock on my bad*$! co-workers! see ya tomorrow!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 18th, 2009 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Slow night, got lots of cleaning in :)\r\n\r\n    Don’t forget to bring the clothes on the back desk to Post San Juan.\r\n\r\n    See you on Wednesday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 9:54 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    Regino and Raquel will be off-island on Sat. Orozco will be in charge. Raquel’s keys and cell phone are on the back desk for her.\r\n\r\n    1902418 was an after-hours check in. They should bring a signed copy of the invoice into the front desk in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s it.\r\n\r\n    PS. Watch Pandora like a hawk. Suddenly it thinks we all need to get religion and has been randomly playing christian praise music on the Groove channel.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation 1902512 was booked by Esary Roofing in Burlington for four of their employees. After booking, the woman asked if she was given the business rate. She has been a repeat customer of ours throughout this summer. I gave her the best rate offered, what are our business rates? And if I didn’t give her that rate, please correct the reservation. Thank you!\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 11:14 am\r\n\r\n    Cindy,\r\n\r\n    Kathy from The Place would like for you to get back to her about the voucher she had turned in a couple weeks ago. She wants to know if it has been sent or if it is available for pick-up at Earthbox. Thank you\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 16th, 2009 at 7:21 am\r\n\r\n    ORCA KITCHEN\r\n    Some workers from Pelindaba called me at 6 in the morning trying to get into the Orca Room. They told me Felicity said it was ok. We get inside an lo and behold there is Lavender oil and whatnot all over the place. Well this message is two-fold. Can we make sure Felicity knows that we don’t open before 8 so she should get a key the night before? And secondly. The front door to the conference room is jammed. I couldn’t open it from the outside or inside. Please let Seth know. On that note I gave the girls working for Pelindaba a spare key to the kitchen. Please make sure we get it back. (PS I love starting the day off with an allergy attack)\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    I am very sorry. I am not sure what took hold in the pool. I thought I had it under control before I went to go off-island. I worked on it again later yesterday evening. Everything looked like it was going away and the chemical levels were fine. Sadly, it looks like it made a comeback overnight. I spent some time in there this morning and I should have gotten it taken care of. I will continue to check it throughout the day but I hope it will begin clearing out. Again I am very sorry.\r\n\r\n    Call me if you have any questions. I will be around here and there until my shift starts. I am having to take care of my mother since she had surgery yesterday.\r\n    Halley Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 9:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone-\r\n\r\n    Thanks so much for bringing me on board, it’s been surprisingly fun :) I was secretly nervous about learning a new system, but it’s been great. Steffi and Morgan- An especially big thanks to you, I really appreciate your patience with my many, many questions. Hopefully I do ya proud. Tonight I had my first phone answering experiences, and I felt pretty comfortable. Steffi will let you know how I really did ;)\r\n    Adios amigos!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Sadie, thanks for making the menu guide all pretty.\r\n\r\n    ICE MACHINE\r\n    Is not working. Sounds like it has electricity, but no ice. Couldn’t check the breaker box because it’s locked, why? Cindy, can you have Seth look at it tomorrow, please? I bought some ice. There is a little left in our employee freezer.\r\n\r\n    UPGRADE\r\n    Now in the shoulder season, please upgrade our guests into nicer rooms if we have them and if they want to. For example if somebody reserved a Water Place, ask them if they would like to stay in a Sky Place. Thank you.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2009 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    The cellphone charger and scarf (hopefully) belonging to the woman from 1843421 was picked up by Angie from Exploritas today. She will give the scarf back to lost and found if it isn’t the woman’s.\r\n\r\n    I usually can’t stand any bit of cold in the air, but I have to admit, it’s pretty refreshing! See you tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2009 at 9:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n\r\n    Steffi- The SATs were good…. its a long day of testing but I feel like I did alright. I will just have to wait and see..\r\n    thanks for asking :)\r\n\r\n    I left a message on the woman’s phone who left the scarf.\r\n\r\n    The women from 1843421 believes she left her scarf in her room. Sadie, please check with Raquel in the morning.\r\n\r\n    Alright, have a good rest of the week everyone. See you on Saturday.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 14th, 2009 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!\r\n\r\n    There is a name tag necklace with a note for Pat(Exploritas leader) on Steffi’s desk. If Pat comes by, please give it to him.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2009 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    EXPLORITAS\r\n    ADVENTURES IN LIFELONG LEARNING\r\n    That’s right. Elderhostel changed their name and concept a little. Please read their mission statement on the white board and from now on, call our favorite shoulder season group by their new name: Exploritas.\r\n\r\n    HOT SAUCE STORE\r\n    Did you know locals get a 10% discount at the hot sauce store? I had to learn it the soft way.\r\n\r\n    ROVER\r\n    If you see our Exploritas guest with the service dog, you have to let him show you how Rover alerts him to sounds. Totally amazing.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Please don’t forget to count the till at night. Every night.\r\n\r\n    Happy week, everybody. Thank you, Morgan for your excellent help training Halley. Thank you, Halley, for catching on so quickly. Call us all on Thursday night, that’s Halley’s first “pick up the phones” shift, oh yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2009 at 1:27 pm\r\n\r\n    How did your test go, Khai?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2009 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan:\r\n    1892580 left their pillow in 309 this morning. Can you ask Raquel and Regino if they found it,please? If its found, his number is on file.\r\n\r\n    1869583 canceled their reservation this evening. They had ordered a romance package, so I called and left a message with SJF letting them know to cancel the flowers and chocolates. Would you mind double checking with them to make sure they got my message without a problem? I realized I talk really fast on answering machines and sometimes people have a hard time understanding what I am saying.. really need to work on that. Ooops.\r\n\r\n    217 has a light bulb that is burnt out. They didn’t want to be disturbed tonight so they asked if someone could do it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Thank you sooo much, Steffi and Sadie, for covering for me on Saturday. I really appreciate it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2009 at 1:01 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    - Please tell housekeeping that 343 was dirty. I had set up an after-hours check-in for that room and it wasn’t clean.\r\n\r\n    - 1892244 was a no show at closing. I called the number on file and left a message ~9:30pm looking for them.\r\n\r\n    - Strawberries have been picked up for 1886757. They are in the fridge.\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2009 at 2:38 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s been an incredibly busy day!! Much to do…\r\n\r\n    Steffi, flowers have been ordered from San Juan Florists for October 16th.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 8th, 2009 at 3:45 pm\r\n\r\n    ALL FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    Please join us on Thursday 10/22/09 at 3PM in the Earthbox Lobby for an all front desk staff meeting. This is a mandatory meeting. Sadie and Dani may join us, but don’t have to (maybe you can woman the front desks during the meeting).\r\n\r\n    SADIE\r\n    I arranged for a taxi for some of our Elderhostel guests before we open. The cab driver will come back at 8 for payment, please pay him out of the till (and give a little tip, they have such a bum deal in the off season). Many other Elderhostel guests will need rides throughout the day. Please call Regino.\r\n    Also: please let me tell you about an early arrival of the Silent World diving group on Saturday. Call me around 2 at BR (in case I don’t catch you).\r\n\r\n    FRAMES\r\n    Our broken frames are repaired and ready for pick up from Friday Harbor Art Studio. Please get them tomorrow, Morgan.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY STAFFING\r\n    Khai has her SAT test on Saturday (we will all be thinking about you:). Sadie will open EB, I will relieve her at noon. Morgan will take over his regular shift at 2. Halley was supposed to be training today, but is sick (hope, you feel better soon). She will let us know if she feels better on Saturday for her next training shift. Morgan, her training check list is in my box. Because of today’s missed training we have just covered key-making and a tiny glimpse into WRP.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY GROUP\r\n    We’ll have a small diving group staying with us on Saturday. Please charge card on file, make keys and give invoice to group leader. Rooming list is in my box.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 7th, 2009 at 10:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Wednesday!\r\n    I LOVE this weather! Its perfect for me. Fall is my favorite, even when it is raining :)\r\n\r\n    The sink in the kitchen seemed to be draining a little slow, maybe we should have Seth take a look at it?\r\n\r\n    Steffi, this is a reminder to call me about the potential shift switching on Saturday, in case you didn’t get my message.. or two.. haha.\r\n\r\n    I didn’t take out the trash tonight because there was barely anything in them. I figured we should save the bags.\r\n\r\n    Have I mentioned I LOOOVE this weather? ;)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 6th, 2009 at 9:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing too exciting tonight. Lots of guests in the lobby. Had some wonderful conversations :)\r\n    Be back tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 5th, 2009 at 8:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Halley and I had a great time training today. She will be up on speed in no time, yeah!\r\n\r\n    PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO:\r\n\r\n    1) Bring items forgotten by guests to Post San Juan ASAP.\r\n\r\n    2) Straighten out the chairs in front of building E whenever they have been moved around, but at least in the morning and at night.\r\n\r\n    3)Count the till every night.\r\n\r\n    4) Vacuum the lobby at least once per day.\r\n\r\n    5) Fill out your daily check list and put in my box for every shift.\r\n\r\n    Do it or the paycheck fairy won’t come (kidding, of course, but please do it:)\r\n    Happy sunny week, everybody!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 5th, 2009 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    What a morning, the sun is out and it has that fall crisp feeling… We live in paradise, I was reminded of that while I was tromping around downtown Seattle this weekend, the city is full of exciting things to do and see and of course buy, but to arrive home with the beautiful moon shinning on the pristine waters is unbelievable.\r\n    Have you all checked out the fancy new deck in the back yard? Seth is doing an amazing job on.\r\n    Remember to welcome Haley from the spa today, she is starting her training here with Steffi.. Welcome Haley:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2009 at 9:28 pm\r\n\r\n    CHANGE…\r\n    …we can believe in…..\r\n    Morgan, when you do the mail tomorrow, can you get us some 1’s and 5’s please? Look in petty cash for large bills. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2009 at 8:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Uh, I love our Elderhostel guests. Everybody is so sweet, excited to be here and so aware to be here. I’m having a blast. I had discussions with several people about water usage. Let’s remind Raquel to remind our lovely housekeepers to leave the towels when they are hung up and only take the ones laying on the floor. Several people were concerned we wash the sheets every day. These folks mean it. I told them we will change them only on the third day. One couple insisted to leave their sheets the same during the entire stay (that would be the Argentinians who want to teach me to tango, oh my).\r\n\r\n    Again I had a chance to impress several people with our new remotes, so easy to program, oh yeah (they think I’m a technological genius, ha)!\r\n\r\n    We need to get our guest directories together soon. I keep taking them from empty rooms to guests in need, but on nights like tonight it’s hard to find one.\r\n\r\n    And then there is the harvest moon. Wow. One of those days were I’m just grateful to be allowed to live here.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2009 at 9:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Morgan, superfrontdeskstaffpersonhero!!!!\r\n    You got slammed today. Great job hanging in there and not dropping any balls. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 2nd, 2009 at 3:31 pm\r\n\r\n    321-202 SWITCHEROO (I’m rhyming!)\r\n    Our guests in 202 really wanted an i-pod docking radio, so I switched their alarm clock with the i-pod thingy from 321. Morgan, can you please let Raquel know to switch them back on Sunday? Do you know if you need that little cable to play music? I couldn’t find one on any i-pod radio, mhm.\r\n\r\n    EMAIL NO SERVE\r\n    Our email still doesn’t work and Chris didn’t stop by. Please call him again tomorrow, Mo.\r\n\r\n    MEDICINE LEFT IN WIND PLACE\r\n    Our guest checking out of the Wind Place today left some things in the fridge. Most important some compounded medicine for their kid. Please ask Raquel first thing tomorrow if found. They are still vacationing on the island and will need the medicine.\r\n\r\n    LA LISTA DE VERIFICATION\r\n    There are printed out copies on the back desk by the beach cruiser release forms:)\r\n\r\n    10-10-2009\r\n    Khai, could you maybe just switch with Mo on that Saturday? How long does the test run? Got your day off requests for later in October.\r\n\r\n    SUSIE’S\r\n    Will pick up their moped tomorrow. They rent with a day’s notice until 10/15 and then they are done for the season. Fall, here we come!\r\n\r\n    LA MUSICA\r\n    I love the new play-lists, Laura. Thank you.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 1st, 2009 at 8:27 am\r\n\r\n    PANDORA\r\n\r\n    Okay, so at the risk of annoying everyone who works the front desk, I am going to set limits on Pandora. No more adding new artists. As you all know, I’m all about the details and music is a big part of it. I know that my musical tastes don’t reflect all of yours and I’m sorry about that. But we have a very specific image we want to present and when you change the music, you change the image.\r\n\r\n    So, if you would like to add a new artist, run it by me first. I will make several different stations so that you can flip between them, if you get maxed out on one.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for your understanding!\r\n\r\n    The Party Pooper.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2009 at 9:31 pm\r\n\r\n    ¿Dónde está la lista de verificación?\r\n    Apparently the front desk checklist has been moved from the desktop, and I cannot find it…\r\n\r\n    Some people from the Icelandic group will be charging long distance calls from their room. One man came to put his credit card on file this afternoon but I realized all the rooms were under one reservation so I just wrote his cc info in the reservation notes. I’m assuming more of them will make calls. What would be a more efficient way to arrange this?\r\n\r\n    It was a good night here at Earthbox. I’ll be back tomorrow :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2009 at 1:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone..\r\n    The spa called today, they have new hours..\r\n    Monday thru Thursday they will be open from 12:00pm to 6:15pm, the last appointment being 5:15pm, Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be normal business hours. Of course if you have a guest that would like appointments at times that they are not open you may call the spa and they will try to get a therapist in for the appointment.\r\n    There was some money in an envelope in the safe with Stefan’s name on it, did anyone know where that came from it was dated 9-5-09? It looks like a drop but i just found it?\r\n    Morgan, thanks again for this morning.. your the BEST…\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    September 29th, 2009 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Helloooo….\r\n\r\n    Very, very, quiet night. Not much to report. Cindy, I looked for the ASB card but never did find it. This is my last night here for the season. Hope everyone has a great winter, and I am sure I will be seeing everyone around town. :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2009 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER MEN’S ROOM\r\n    needs to be unlocked. Regino said Elderhostel has a key, but they called me to ask for it. Can you please make sure that somebody opens that tomorrow?\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    Hairdryer doesn’t work. I brought a spare. Wrote maintenance request.\r\n\r\n    Chilly tonight. Turned on the lobby heater for the first time. Brrrrr. Alright, it’s the end of September. I guess it’s allowed to be a little chilly.\r\n\r\n    AMAZING WILDLIFE\r\n    You know the guests we had for the memorial on Sunday? They had the ceremony out at Lime Kiln Park to celebrate his love for the whales. And just when they were starting, J-Pod came by and swam and jumped around for hours. Isn’t that something? Gave me goose bumps.\r\n\r\n    Another thing which gave me goose bumps, but in a different way: last night I drove home, foggy, and I see those little eyes. I slow way down and it’s a fox dragging some junks of meat across the street. I think to myself: huh, what is he snacking upon? And I look and it’s another (dead) fox. Yuk.\r\n    And that were the wildlife news.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 27th, 2009 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Mo,\r\n    I hope you feel better. All is good. Please let HK know to tidy/clean 216. Cindy’s fam was spending time in there.\r\n    Wow, I love the new remote controls. You don’t have to go to remote control college to input a code, super easy, yeah!\r\n    See you soon.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 24th, 2009 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Sadie and Morgan,\r\n    Cindy is off for the weekend. Sadie, call me at home if you have questions.\r\n    Morgan, I put a couple of thingies to do in your box. The Elderhostel one is time sensitive, please tackle soon.\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget to go through upcoming reservations when you have a moment. Found a couple of things not followed up for tomorrow, we could have caught earlier. No biggy, Sadie will make it right for those folks.\r\n\r\n    Also: we haven’t gotten the fall ferry schedules yet. Can you guys pick some up from the ferry during shift change this weekend , please?\r\n    Happy sunny weekend, everybody.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 23rd, 2009 at 8:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello\r\n\r\n    Everything is good here at Earthbox. Slow night.. I had all of my check ins by 4:30 this afternoon and not one walk in :( That being said, as per Cindy I am closing tonight at 9. Regino stopped in already to get the phone so I let him know. The front desk cell phone is almost out of battery so I put Regino’s number on the closed sign. I also changed the office hours so it says we close at 9pm. Steffi, you might want to change both of those tomorrow night :)\r\n\r\n    There will be some soccer moms from the Fusions calling to book rooms for Nov. 6-8. There aren’t rooms set aside, but there is a group folio.\r\n\r\n    The trash and recycling cans were all pretty much empty except for the bathroom and kitchen ones, so I took those out and left the rest.\r\n\r\n    Have a good rest of the week, see you on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    P.S. If a package comes for me, please call or text my cell. Thanks!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2009 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Why are there a bunch of vouchers that have made? Answer: Because Morgan and I are rockstars! Hee! Hee!\r\n\r\n    CRUISIN’ THE ISLAND\r\n    WOW! We had some guests that used the beach cruisers and went all the way out to Lime Kiln today! What a beautiful day for biking! They had a great time, and plan on taking them for a spin in the morning.\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    A big thank-you to Morgan for showing me how to program the new remotes….I think they are cool, very teal and retro.\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    I did everything on my checklist, but take out the recycling, it was only 1/2 full so I smashed it down so we do not waste a bag…go earth!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2009 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    What, nothing happens when I’m not here? Please blog a little. I want to know what’s going on, how you are feeling, what you are doing, are you having fun, are our guests having fun?\r\n\r\n    CHECK LIST\r\n    We now have our very own exciting daily check lists. They are by the beach cruiser release forms. Please fill one out for every shift you work and stick it in my box.\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL CHART\r\n    Last special chart is up. Starting October we have fantastic specials going on and won’t need it anymore.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE STATION\r\n    Morgan, can you sneak into the Orca room tomorrow and stock us up good on sugar (individual), coffee cups, TP, hot coco, cider and everything else you can get your hands on, please? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Please don’t forget to count the till every night and drop all cash income in the safe. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    POOL PATIO LIGHTS\r\n    I can’t get the rope lights to turn on. Is it me?\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Picked it up today.\r\n\r\n    I can’t get over this weather. I love it. Thank you, Rain Shadow.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2009 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday, enjoy your weekend, enjoy the sun.. We have had a gorgeous fall….\r\n    R & R\r\n    Are off island on Saturday, Orozco will be in charge :)\r\n    Morgan just found out the fence is down and the bushes are gone.. Sorry about that Morgan… It will be SO nice next week when Mr. Seth completes the fence.. No more stinky shrubs..\r\n    Check off list\r\n    Steffi is creating a closing check off list for EB, this will make it easier to make sure all the little things get taken care of before we close at night.\r\n    107 is being repaired, we had a little water leak, Seth will let us know when it is back up and running.\r\n    Enjoy..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 16th, 2009 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    307 needs to be cleaned, please let housekeeping know.\r\n    khaili Says:\r\n    September 15th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    map paper ordered.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2009 at 7:21 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Stefan or Cindy, can you please call Printonyx and see if our map paper is ready. We are out and Morgan ordered it last week.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Stefan, can you run to the bank and get us some 5’s please? Khai, don’t forget to count the till at night and drop any extra cash. Thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\n    302\r\n    has a package on the back desk. I keep calling, but nobody picks up. Please try some more tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    NEW SCHEDULE\r\n    is up.\r\n\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Bye bye, Sweety. It was such a pleasure working with you this season. You are amazing. Let us know if you ever need a letter of reference. Good luck with the life thing (you gonna be just fine). And please stay in touch.\r\n\r\n    Wonderful day here at EB. Lot’s of fun people, lot’s of walk-ins. This supersweet couple got me a a little bottle of vodka because they loved my customer service. How about that? Totally made my day. Thank you, sweet people, who also work customer service!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2009 at 8:31 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Guys, please remember to drop your cash income every day and count the till EVERY night.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    See Elderhostel letter on back desk. A whole group of participants want to stay longer and arrive earlier. I left a message with the guest in charge. Offer most moderate rate plus an extra 10% off for EH participants.\r\n\r\n    MORE ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    The participant’s health forms are in my box. In case of an health emergency, make sure to give the EMT’s the forms.\r\n\r\n    109\r\n    I spoke to Al today. He is thinking of staying here with his handicapped wife. I initialed our business card with the rate I quoted him. Please honor and try to give him 109 or a sun place. His wife is in a wheel chair but can walk a little.\r\n    Thank you, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2009 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    AND??????\r\n    Morgan are you an uncle yet? And Cindy a great aunt?\r\n    Happy Labor Day weekend everybody!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2009 at 10:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Morgan!\r\n    There is a gift certificate with a sticky note on it on the back desk, please read it :)\r\n\r\n    There are also some bridesmaids gifts on the back desk. The names are on the envelopes and they each also get a bottle of wine from the back desk and one white umbrella which are located in the luggage room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Please tell housekeeping that both 343 and 335 will need a tidy. Both guests moved to different rooms.\r\n\r\n    That is all.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 2:49 pm\r\n\r\n    High School Future Fair in October\r\n    I have offered a rate of $119, for a single or double room. Each individual will pay for their own reservation.\r\n    Thanks…\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2009 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Today is my last “day shift” working since school is starting. The wheels on the bus go round-n-round! :) Thanks to Khai and Cindy for working for me this morning while I was at the High School.\r\n    Not much to report. Our group is here and happy, and all is well. I cannot believe it is the last day of August….WOW!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2009 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    If a package comes for me, please call my cell phone :)\r\n    Thaaank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2009 at 9:09 am\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    I remade the keys. A good portion of them were wiped.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2009 at 6:00 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please bring bike #4 to the bike shop (breaks not good) and pick up the 2 repaired ones. We have an account with them. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    116\r\n    Needs a tidy, please let Raquel know. I moved the guests.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2009 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys,\r\n\r\n    1816942… check it out.\r\n\r\n    Kois Center is doing their breakfast in the conference room instead of at the pool patio.\r\n\r\n    Everyone is in. Life is good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2009 at 5:40 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN SATURDAY\r\n    Morgan, can you please take a 1/2 hour on Saturday morning, go down to Bird Rock with the key maker and read and redo guest keys if necessary. Also, can you show whoever is down there how to permanently lock/unlock the front door with the master key. This is really important, please don’t forget. If Stefan is too busy, have Khai help him for a bit. Thank you. Please blog about it, so I know it’s done.\r\n\r\n    #1814557\r\n    Is approved by all boss ladies. Thank you, Carla:)\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL\r\n    Our housekeeping warrior is off tomorrow. Don’t bug her.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2009 at 2:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy mid-week Wednesday! Wahoo! It was busy, busy, busy this morning! The group for today is all checked-in, and all went well! They are happy! :)\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Please check reservation #1814557 and make sure it is approved by you.\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    Don’t forget about opening on Monday, thank you, thank you, thank you! I will be here right after the school district breakfast. You are an amazing rockstar! :) :)\r\n\r\n    Is it me? Or is there a lot of runners here on the island this summer? I swear every 5 minutes someone is asking me about running trails and running routes!\r\n\r\n    Hope everyone has a great rest of the week!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2009 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh in addition. The act of me printing the reconciliation report for tonight made the back printer finally run out of ink. I replaced the cartridge but we need to order another one so we have one on hand. Please tell Techie Chris that the front desk computers no longer print to the back printer again. Probably had something to do with the power outage. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    How about that power outage eh? Fun times, fun times…\r\n    Jeez I swear. It can be dead quiet and the minute I get on the phone to make a reservation I get 2 rooms calling in. Why does that happen? whew! :) Just a couple of things:\r\n    - The water heater in building A’s vent got stuck again causing the heater to turn off. Is there anything we can do to make sure it doesn’t get jammed preventing the gas from igniting?\r\n    - As I was walking back in A’s parking lot I heard this horribly annoying sound. Sounded almost like a lawn mower. I tracked the sound down to the vent hood that is coming out of the roof of Building B above the kitchen. I don’t know if that will be a West Mechanical thing or if perhaps Seth can look at it. But it randomly turns on and off so it probably should be looked at. By the way one of the refigerators in the kitchen is really, really noisy.\r\n    - Can we possibly change the the books in the room to tell the guests that the current wifi password is on their invoice? It currently tells them to call us for the current PW. I swear 90% off the calls we get from rooms are guests asking for the password. Just a thought.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! Thanks all. Have a good one.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2009 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPS THIS WEEK\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY 8/26 HEARTLAND\r\n    Will arrive on 9:50AM ferry, Regino will do luggage and people shuttle, guests know the rooms might not be ready yet. Prepare remote check-in, suppress pricing, take cc from each guest. The next day they will store luggage with us and will go to Syndey in the afternoon. Regino will handle the luggage again.\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY 8/27 KOIS\r\n    Will arrive around 5PM by private boat. Regino will do luggage and people shuttle. Prepare remote check in, suppress pricing, take cc from each guest. They will have seminars in the conference center and will have breakfast in the pool patio on Friday & Saturday. Please put sign on patio gate, saying: Kois Center Breakfast, Private Party (in my box). They will use the patio from 7AM to 10AM. Our other guests can order coffee from the pool entrance side during those times. On Saturday SJ Transit will pick up the spouses for an island tour after breakfast.\r\n    They’ll leave Saturday before noon. Regino will do shuttle.\r\n\r\n    Detailed Itineraries and rooming lists for both groups are in my box.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2009 at 2:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh! Happy Monday! It has turned out to be such a pretty day, even though it was….BRRRRR….cold this morning! Here is all of my fabulous news!\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    Morgan, Morgan, Morgan, no worries…I have folded and straightened the gift shop. It is so beautiful now. Cindy, thanks for organizing the T-shirts some more!\r\n\r\n    STOCKED COFFEE AREA\r\n    The lobby coffee table is all stocked, stocked, stocked. We still need to ask Raquel if she needs anything when we order 1/2 and 1/2. I forgot. :(\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN ROASTERS\r\n    Called and ordered more coffee today, it should be here by 3:00. They wanted me to let everyone know that they roast everyday at 11:00 a.m. Monday through Friday. We need to make sure we order coffee on Friday morning for the weekend.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2009 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew. They kept me busy tonight. Phone calls, guest needs, pool towels, the works. Gift shop got hit hard too.\r\n    -I did a little bit of tidying when I could but if no one has time tomorrow to do a full refolding, I will try to do it tomorrow night.\r\n    -I picked up new batteries for the clock.\r\n    -Steffi I am going to ask you for clarification on just how you want the cash drawer done.\r\n    -We are out of liquid creamer packets. We should ask Raquel if she needs anything then put in a Sysco order.\r\n    -That’s about it. Happy Birthday Khai!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2009 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    $$ CASH $$\r\n    As of today I need everybody to drop cash income after every shift (invoice, money in envelope, drop in safe). The night shift shall count the till every night. New, spiffy and quite exciting till counting sheets are in the cash drawer. Thanks.\r\n\r\n    BIG CLOCK\r\n    Our big lobby clock needs a battery. Can you please go get one tomorrow, Morgan?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2009 at 12:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Will be closed tomorrow and Sunday. Please make sure the guests know\r\n    Thanks guys\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    One thing before I go Regino and I could not find the front desk cell phone so I posted Regino’s phone on the door I think it will turn up but for now…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2009 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    I just said goodbye to Lilly, I am going to miss her SO much. Thanks for all your hard work this summer Lil, you were the super hero coffee barista.. Have fun In Cali and remember watch out for the creepers… (it’s a mom thing:) XO\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2009 at 7:54 pm\r\n\r\n    OK so far so good! We had a bunch of walkins which is nice just a small problem though, the screen on key maker died you can still make keys but you cannot see what you are punching. I think all of us have done it for quite some time now so you can still do it by memory if you don’t remember however Khaili and I made instructions. They are taped right next to the machine so that can help. Other then that everything is OK.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2009 at 2:23 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Now that Lilly and Cody are gone, I am going to be out there. It will be closed Mondays and Tuesdays and whenever I am working the opening shift at Earthbox. All other mornings I will be out there until my front desk shift starts.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2009 at 4:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n    Seth is going to be gone until Friday. So he will not be available for consultations or maintenance until then. So in other words let’s give him a break. He thanks you for your consideration.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2009 at 1:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! Hello! Cindy has requested that we please put the check-in reciepts and the beach cruiser release forms the same direction in the drawer. That way, if we need to go back and check something it is easier and not so much of a hassle. :) Today is great, sunny and warm, and happy guests!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2009 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Saturday :)\r\n    We now have a variety pack of band-aids located in the bathroom on the shelf. Nice.\r\n    Besides that, not much to pass on.\r\n    The sun is out today. Yaaay\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2009 at 6:09 pm\r\n\r\n    BAND AIDS\r\n    Khai, please go to the store today and get some band aids in different sizes for the lobby and for the pool. We are very low at both places.\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    We are out of remotes. I ordered more on Monday, they should have been here by now. Anybody? Well, if you need one, try to fiddle with the older ones, we have some of those in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    SIGNS\r\n    Mr. Rand dropped off some new signs. They are in the luggage room. Please let Seth know.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 14th, 2009 at 9:57 am\r\n\r\n    Stefan\r\n    Grant from HP called. His number is in your box :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2009 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! I didn’t know where to put the no vacancy sign this morning. I placed it over by the wooden sign in the corner by the front door. Does it have a home? We will be needing it the next few days, wahoo! Hope everyone gets a chance to visit the San Juan County Fair! :)\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2009 at 7:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all, I had a great summer here and I am planning on at least stopping in on my breaks. Pretty busy today, fully booked yet again for the next few days. Bike #1 has an awkward seat, its by Morgan’s door. Thanks again for such a fun summer, gonna miss yall! Call me and stop by Pullman anytime!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2009 at 2:40 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I left a message with all upcoming guests regarding 312’s electrical issue. They might call back for clarification.\r\n    Also: make sure to mention it to each guest booking 312 until September (when Opalco will be able to fix it).\r\n    Here’s the spiel in short: the electricity in half the room cuts out sometimes and comes right back on. It’s not dangerous, it’s not on our end.\r\n\r\n    JIM LAWSON\r\n    is the plumber working on my new house (yippieeehh!). I left an envelope for him on the back desk. Please give it to him when he stops by.\r\n\r\n    ELIOT\r\n    Bye bye, Sweetheart! It was a pleasure working with you and telling you not to text at work:) Your people skills are excellent and you will be missed by our guests. Please give Morgan your office keys and your all-access key. Have a great time at college (don’t forget to learn something as well). Let us know when you are back for breaks. Take care.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2009 at 5:59 pm\r\n\r\n    303\r\n    Bathtub drains slow. Please have Regino have a look.\r\n\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Stefan was sick today. I haven’t heard from him. Please contact me if we need to cover his shift. I have covered his Sunday shift, but haven’t found anybody for Saturday. I hope, you are feeling better, Stefan!\r\n\r\n    BASKETBALL\r\n    One of our guests donated a basketball to us. They felt like shooting hoops at sunken park and bought a cheapo ball, he won’t need at home. It’s in the luggage room. thank you!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2009 at 2:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all-\r\n    Its good to be back.\r\n    I had to use the emergency hold room for tomorrow, we had a little reservation mishap. If there is a cancellation for tomorrow, please block it out as our emergency hold room :)\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2009 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    RADIO CAMPAIGN\r\n    We are part of a radio campaign, which starts today. Potential guests can obtain Trade Scrip towards a stay. This will be treated like cash, can not be used with any other discounts or special rates. Look at the white board, read the restrictions, have me explain the details to you the next time we work together.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2009 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    312 can be rented, but make sure you tell the guests, we have an off again on again issue with the lights that cannot be fixed for 2 weeks. If they have an issue, work with them. Ask Cindy or Steffi..\r\n    I moved all kinds of people so that other guests would be able to stay in their rooms the whole time of their stay, please remember to look at the overall calendar, when we are so close to being sold out so that we can manage our space to the best of our ability..\r\n    Thanks for all your hard work..\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2009 at 10:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy night surprisingly! The lovely ladies in room 335 will be stopping by in the morning before their kayak tour and will be extending their stay in an Earthplace, I already took care of everything :) , no complaints except the internet on the guest computer stopped working for some reason? Chris is being kept busy. See yall tomorrow! get better Khaili!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2009 at 3:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, what a day, 312 is rearing it’s head AGAIN… Opalco, Electricians were fast to hunt down the issue. The bad news, it can not be fixed until possible next week, we are sold out and I have left a message with the next arriving party, please look at the monthly calender, if this happens during a stay feel free to credit.\r\n    WRP\r\n    It has been SO slow, Chris T has been talking to the support system and they will be running tests today trying to figure out what the scoop is..\r\n    Thanks so much..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Whew! busy busy busy. Phones ringing, guests needing stuff. Kept me running.\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n    Mr. Lin, a guest from Bird Rock, is storing some salmon he caught today in the Orca Room freezer. He will be by around 9:30am 8/5 to pick it all up. (If I haven’t stolen it all by then ;) )\r\n\r\n    Eliot – The folks in 210/211 you were trying so hard to book a kayaking trip for decided to just bag it. Sorry.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    The power returned and when the guys came with the pinpointer machine to find the location of the short between the room and the transformer box, the power came back on, so here we go again, If the power shall short again, please call Frankie at 378.8174 he will shuttle right over and get his handy dandy pinpointer out to locate the short…\r\n    WOW, we were slammed today.. YIPEE……\r\n    Until then, if we happen to lose the power, please take $50 off the guest nightly rate..\r\n    Gracias..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2009 at 1:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all! Hope everyone is having a great summer. San Juan Safaris wanted to remind us today that they are only booking 5:30 sunset tours until August 22nd. Things went well this morning. Crazy busy as usual, but all is well!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2009 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Thanks to the quick efforts of Super Dave, he had OPALCO figure out the electrical problem that 312 is having. They will be in tomorrow to fix it. We had to move the poor guest that was in there though. Please let housekeeping know that they will need to clean it tomorrow. I blocked 312 out for 2 days. Please make sure you unblock it once everything is finished. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    I was unable to find the invoice you were looking for. There is another box in the back office it could be in but I only got through part of it. Perhaps we could go through that one tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2009 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    SAVE SAFE PLEASE\r\n    Lock that thing. Seriously. Otherwise it’s only an unsafe. get it? Ha, ha.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2009 at 3:46 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING REPORTS\r\n    Hey all. Raquel and Regino ask if we could all print out the housekeeping reports without “page breaks.” That way the morning housekeeping report gets boiled down to 2-3 pages unlike the 7-8 that would come out otherwise. Thanks!\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2009 at 4:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all!\r\n\r\n    If anyone knows anything about a navy blue appointment book which was left by a previous guest of ours, Janis Smith, PLEASE let me know. I have her information and she would like for it to be sent off to her. She had left it here a while ago, about 3 weeks. She was told it had been found and now it has completely vanished. Enjoy the perfect weather!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2009 at 4:27 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI – ORDERING QUEEN\r\n    I ordered lobby coffee, room coffee (FSA), told Sysco to pick up the room coffee we don’t want/need, left message for Gerard for hot coco, apple cider, creamer and new corn starch water cups. When I had my massage the spa gave me water in this really nice corn starch cup, I would like us to have them. I put one on our ordering board, check it out.\r\n\r\n    LOBBY SUPPLY STOCKING\r\n    When we run low on things we need in the lobby, paper products, teas, hot coco, cups, etc. please go get them from the Orca room. Raquel and her crew are too busy to run errands for us right now.\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    We are consistently over when I reconcile cash. When you guys get quarters out of the safe, do you put the same amount you took out of the till and put it in the safe?\r\n\r\n    Give me an earth, give me a box, what does that spell? Go team!\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW!! absurdly busy this morning! Island Gardens would like to know if we could put up a sign or something in the new gardens to prevent pets from ‘using’ them. Lavendera Day Spa would also like to remind us to ask for the name of people receiving massages. Not quite as hot today, and surprisingly many people did not die from the heat!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2009 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    It was just going to well I guess. So we could not open room 117 something wrong with the lock we wrestled with it for quite some time but in the end we managed to fix it thanks to Regino. We might have some cranky guests tomorrow because of the noise but I hope not. That’s it from me I am OFF.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2009 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    OK busy busy day. Everything went fine just some minor bumps on the road. One thing morning shift one of our guest wanted to take 2 bicycles early in the morning before it gets too hot around 6am so I let him take them. His driver’s license is still here in the office.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2009 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Holy Moly it was hot today. Wheew!!\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    The shower handle came off when they went to take a shower. They are pretty good natured folks who managed to get it working long enough for them to shower. Please have Seth take a look at it when he gets in. They are a stay-over but will be out and about early so they think they will be gone whenever he wants to go work on it.\r\n\r\n    NEW SHIRTS\r\n    We have some cool new shirts in. Cindy, all of them are priced, sorted by size, type, color, and put in the back room. I didn’t put them out because I wasn’t sure if you had a master plan for their display.\r\n\r\n    OH yeah by the way. 1000th post! Boom baby! W000000000T!!! :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2009 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Isn’t that a song by “The Cure”?\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Its hot….hot…..hot….\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2009 at 6:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Can you please make sure if you don’t make a voucher for something to make an alarm so that someone can make it later.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2009 at 7:21 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFIRM ADVENTURES WITH GUEST\r\n    We had a couple of disappointed guests today. They adventures were booked at different times than they wanted them. Please always confirm with the guest. This is their vacation, their fun, their break. We need to do everything we can to make their trip memorable and not stressful.\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOM\r\n    We have a Water Place as an emergency room tomorrow. Please release in the early evening.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you check the printer driver on my computer one more time, please? I can’t print anything to Cindy’s printer.\r\n\r\n    BIKE # 16\r\n    Please bring to shop tomorrow, it has a slow leak in the rear tire.\r\n\r\n    LAST MINUTE SPECIALS\r\n    I will email the last minute special sheet tomorrow afternoon when I get to work at BR. Please print and use. Khai and Morgan, will you let Eliot and Sadie know what this is all about, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy weekend everybody. Enjoy the fabulous weather. Don’t forget to mention that we don’t have AC:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    337\r\n    needs to be cleaned. Please let HK know.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys,\r\n    I’ve put up our summer target numbers as a way for you to earn some extra cash this summer. Check it out on the white board for now. I’ll put it up in Steffi’s office in a few days.\r\n    Laura\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2009 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Front Desk Headsets\r\n    Stefan and I are the mighty headset fixers:) There is NO more scotch tape on the front desk headsets..\r\n    Window,\r\n    OOPS my office window was left open last night. Don’t forget to check back here when it is hot, before you close..\r\n    Adventure Tours\r\n    Are you making sure you tell EVERY guest that takes an adventure to check in 30 minutes prior to departure. If you are forgetting and the guest misses their trip, do you want to pay the Adventure company for the missed seats? I sure don’t want to, Please remember to tell EVERYONE the check in time and the cancellation policy..\r\n    Morgan\r\n    It seems the pool keys from the BR are able to access the pool earlier than 8am, can you please check that for me and get back to me? Also what is the status of the bike grips? Dan from the Spa place is going to come over, Seth is measuring the drains today, and taking pictures with an underwater camera and then mailing them to Dan. Then he will make an appointment to come over for the assessment.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2009 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello,\r\n\r\n    Carla\r\n    Colleen from SJ Safaris will be calling in the morning regarding the voucher on the back desk. The people missed the boat and wanted a refund. The people at SJS said she needed to talk to Colleen.\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Thank you, again, for working around my ridiculous schedule :)\r\n\r\n    Eventful night, lots of running around. There was a fun group of people in the lobby for a while, they kept me entertained with all their tourist experiences on the island.. funny stuff.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2009 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Closing duties\r\n    Please when you are the last one here, empty the bathroom garbage also, plus if you are using the bathroom and notice the garbage needs to be emptied, please take it out.\r\n    Since we have had the hot days, i have been leaving the back office windows open, please remember to close them and make sure they are locked before you close for the night.\r\n    Holding reservations\r\n    If you hold a reservation for a few hours, make sure you put the time in the notes that you told the guests you would release it if they don’t call back. Normally we don’t hold reservations but once in a while we do, but if you do, you need to follow up on it, if you are not going to be here make sure you leave an alarm and put lots of notes in the file..\r\n    Remind out guest to go to tripadvisor.com and write a review for us..\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2009 at 5:57 pm\r\n\r\n    hey guest in 333 moved to 326, if 333 could be set as dirty that would be awesome! Super Duper busy today and it is so beautiful out…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 7:30 pm\r\n\r\n    ELIOT’S TUESDAY LISTS\r\n    Please bring bike # 2 to the repair shop (brakes don’t work). See what’s wrong with the bikes by Morgan’s apartment and bring it to the repair shop if necessary.\r\n    Bring broken picture to framer on Web Street.\r\n    Provide the excellent customer service you always provide:)\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. yeah!\r\n    Eliot Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Important note about the referral codes dropping in reservations: if the code drops while you are trying to change a reservation, write down what you needed to change so you don’t lose it, and go back and search for the reservation again. If it drops the code again, stop and don’t do anything else to the reservation. You are to call 800-221-3429 ext#2 and report the problem. If you are on the phone with a guest, let them know that everything will be taken care of and write down the information necessary.\r\n\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2009 at 12:35 pm\r\n\r\n    PILLOW\r\n    There is a shipping slip all filled out for a pillow that was left behind in the Wind Place. (Raquel will drop it by the office)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2009 at 11:50 am\r\n\r\n    oops, that was supposed to say “leave 339 open”…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2009 at 11:49 am\r\n\r\n    If you can avoid it, leave open for tonight. The nice man staying downstairs would appreciate it :)\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2009 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Can we have some one have a look at the bathroom in the wind place first thing in the morning. It smells bad. Guest said it might be a sewer leak.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2009 at 3:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of things:\r\n\r\n    First, just a reminder to make sure that we put the date and times on all vouchers.\r\n\r\n    Also, with the Free Lunch special the deal is $20 off ONE night’s stay, am I right? I have noticed that some reservations for the free lunch were getting $20 off per night…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 7:26 pm\r\n\r\n    #1732426\r\n    Please get guest’s cc info upon check out. They have an outstanding balance and WRP didn’t save their cc info. I called them, they know.\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget to release our hold room later tomorrow, once you are sure we are good.\r\n\r\n    Gorgeous, busy, sunny, fabulicious island day….\r\n    Peace\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    LANDSCAPING\r\n\r\n    We’ve got another small landscaping project going in next Monday for a few days. It will be over by the guest laundry. It shouldn’t cause too much problem, but if it does, as always, just let me know and apologize to the guests.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2009 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Remotes\r\n    Steffi, go ahead and order some from American Hotel Registry\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Cafe Zia is open every day, last week they were closed on Tuesday due to some scheduling issues.\r\n    Enjoy the weekend..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2009 at 4:02 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    On Monday, 7/20 when you work at Bird Rock, will you please order a bunch of pay per view and see if we can get that to work for our guests?\r\n\r\n    TV REMOTES\r\n    We have none. Can we please order some more?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2009 at 2:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Sun is out and Friday is around the corner :) A few things:\r\n    Wind Place\r\n    The Wind Place has a maximum of 6 people in the room, MAYBE a small baby under 2, Morgan had listed 7 maybe 8 and that is not correct, so I wanted to make sure you all knew that. The extra rate occurs after the first 4.\r\n    Dishes\r\n    We use to have a “Do your own dishes” sign in the back kitchen, but, I took that down quite a while ago. Please make sure if you have a moment when it is slow that you keep the kitchen tidy, whether they are your dishes or not. Never close the office with a dirty kitchen.. We can also, vacuum, and dust if it is slow. Throw out dead flowers and keep the front office tidy. :)\r\n    WIFI\r\n    Chris Teren took a look at the wifi today, he said everything was running good. Sometimes due to the island connectivity levels we are going to run into guests not having a great connection. Please let the guests know that you will forward their concern onto our computer tech person, then you need to call Chris T and leave him a message.\r\n    Busy weekend here on Friday Harbor, it is the A Splash of Summer Arts Fair.. Enjoy and pass it a long to our guests, It is held on the street in front of Rock Island, by the Court House.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2009 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CHANGE\r\n    We need to get some change for the cash drawer.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2009 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    WIRELESS\r\n    Got a couple of complaints about the internet being way too slow one guest ran a test and said it was running at only 190 or so KB\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2009 at 11:27 am\r\n\r\n    PARKING LOT & POOL PATIO:\r\n\r\n    Our man Seth will be restriping the parking lots this Wednesday and Thursday. Please apologize to any guests who are frustrated by this, it shouldn’t wreak too much havoc.\r\n\r\n    Seth will be restaining the pool patio next Monday, weather permitting. He will be locking the patio off for 24 hours for the stain to cure. Again, please apologize to any inconvenienced guests. Shouldn’t be too much of a biggy, Cafe Zia is closed and the pool will still be open.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    308\r\n    Light bulb needs to be replaced in the bedside lamp closest to the door. The guest is the travel writer and she is really nice. She just didn’t want to bother with it late at night.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    We are officially out again. The paper should be ready from Printoynx. Someone needs to just run up and grab it. You might want to call first to make sure though. :)\r\n\r\n    Guest 1684562 is having to leave early due to a family emergency. She had a massage scheduled for 5:15 on 7/13. I called and left a message with the spa to try and cancel it. Please call the spa in the morning to check with them. Her voucher is on the back desk and she needs to be refunded the amount of the treatment in the morning. Hopefully the spa will let her go on it, they should.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 8:15 pm\r\n\r\n    HORNETS\r\n    I found a bottle of wasp and hornet spray and doused the opening where they were coming out. Hopefully that took care of them.\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Seth and I are pretty sure the steam out of the shower set of the alarms. There is a smoke alarm right outside the bathroom door. Apparently all four of the guests took steam showers right after the others so it probably built up too much for the bathroom vent to remove. Perhaps we could move the smoke alarm further down the hallway? Since they are all linked together once one goes off they all go off. Seth and I unplugged them from the system but since they all have their own batteries they will all still work for the time being.\r\n\r\n    331\r\n    Guests needed a “brighter” room and moved. They were only in the room for under an hour so please let housekeeping know that it will need a cleaning more than likely.\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Guests checked in an found a pool of water in the bathroom. They seem to think that the toilet may be leaking. I made up a maintenance slip and put some towels down.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2009 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLOG BLOG\r\n    Please blog more. Tell us how it was, what was good, bad, busy, not, what you promised guests, I want to know, please, please tell me!\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Fire alarm went off. Morgan and Seth are dealing with this right now. Breaking news so to speak…. Oh, it’s fixed. Live from Earthbox: Morgan and Seth rock! Apparently the steam shower set it off. Seth will look into it, all is good for now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2009 at 3:46 pm\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Just a reminder to everyone. The Wind Place rate is based on 4 people. Up to 7 people maximum are allowed in the building. (Some exceptions can be made for very small children/babies) and only 1 futon can be added to the room. That’s about it.\r\n\r\n    217\r\n    Is blocked out until tomorrow. Apparently the guests couldn’t get the water to divert to the shower and turned it so hard the spigot came off. Regino says it is an easy fix he will do in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. Lots o’ check-outs today.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2009 at 8:05 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI & ELIOT\r\n    Your time sheets are on my desk, will you please go over them and write down when you clocked out on the days with ?? and put in Cindy’s box. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BEACH CRUISER WITH CHILD SEAT\r\n    One of our stay-over guest had a child seat attached to one of our bikes. Please rent that only to her and not to others. I also allowed 2 lovely ladies to take the cruisers in their car out to the Westside, just to let you know.\r\n\r\n    SPA VOUCHERS & PET POLICIES\r\n    Morgan and I made a bunch. Please keep an eye out when we get low. Make more or if you don’t know how, blog about it. There is nothing worse than to start assembling a needed voucher in the middle of a ferry rush. Well, there is, starving is worse, so is injury, heartbreak, o.k., there are worse things, but you get the point.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    Is a little iffy (Augustitis already?). Happened several times today that we made a phone reservation, saved it and all was lost. So, until we have this fixed, save after you get a guests name and phone number, so you can get back to the guest if need be.\r\n\r\n    INTERNET\r\n    Went down during ferry rush. Morgan was all over it. Our guests are the most patient wonderful people in the world, thank you. Again: print out the day’s check-ins in the morning. You never know what’s coming.\r\n\r\n    Happy busy, sunny weekend everybody. Call me at BRrrrrr if you need me.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2009 at 3:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Phone system\r\n    Frontline will only be answering the phones when we switch our phone line on the console to “night 1 ” please remember that it is SO important to try and get ever call that comes into our office,and for some reason if you cannot, get to that flashing message light ASAP..\r\n    Right now it is taking the answering machine a few too many times to go to the front desk voice mail. Bob J is working on this and we should have it resolved next week.\r\n    Please remember to send any issues you have with WRP to me via email with a detailed account of what is going on.\r\n    Looks like the weekend is upon us and the sun has returned. YAHOOOO!!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2009 at 2:48 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH DROPS\r\n    Please do not use brown Earthbox envelopes or Earthbox stickers for our cash drops. (or any in-house business) they are expensive.\r\n\r\n    A BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\r\n    Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday to Raquel from Cindy and the front desk! We love you and we think you are awesome!\r\n\r\n    Glad to see the sun is starting to come out again! Wahoo!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2009 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA (Male Practitioners)\r\n    Sealy would like us all to be aware that they now have three male practitioners. She would really like us to encourage people to give them a try. Asking guests “have you ever worked with a male practitioner?” Then encourage them to try them saying that they will be satisfied as the male practitioners are both sensitive and professional.\r\n\r\n    SPA PRICES\r\n    Some of the Spa prices have recently changed. please note the changes on the new laminated office copy\r\n\r\n    Pool fence lights won’t go on, Karlita said that the plug seems to be loose at the head, can someone have a look\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2009 at 2:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, the weather has really changed huh? All went well today. We have more map paper coming from Printonyx on Thursday, we printed off enough to get us through until then. If anyone has time tonight, we need more vouchers made for the spa. Have a great night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2009 at 10:28 am\r\n\r\n    It is good to be back (well kinda :) ) I loved my trip and am ready to return, now I know what Laura and Adam have been raving about all these years when it comes to the river, and I suspect I only experienced a little taste of it.. It would be a great team building trip……\r\n    Thank you for keeping everything going, all looks great.. the only thing I am wondering is why the bikes were not taken over to the bike shop to be repaired? Don’t hesitate to cruise (or walk) one over to Paul, he will bill us and then we don’t have any broken bikes hanging out by Morgan’s door..\r\n    Payroll\r\n    I will run the payroll report for June 25, 26, 27 and 28th, if your hours are different then what I paid you on your last paycheck I will make the adjustment on your next check.. Please don’t hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    See you all at 3PM today..\r\n    :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2009 at 3:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow! Great work all of you guys. I was so impressed at how smooth and calm and beautiful everything was at the Box today. Chaos defeated, tranquility reigns.\r\n\r\n    Lilly and I rocked it in Cafe Zia today. Lots of fun. Thanks for letting me share in the joy, Lilly.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for doing such an amazing job!\r\n\r\n    Happy Independence Day.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2009 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Fourth :)\r\n\r\n    Check out 1574924.\r\n\r\n    Another bike is added to our broken bike collection by Morgan’s porch. The tire is rubbing on frame.\r\n\r\n    Nice and busy today. Definitely not boring..\r\n    Anyways, I hope everyone has fun tonight :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PARADE CHAIRS\r\n    Khai, I printed out some signs, saying “reserved for Earthbox guests”. Please use those when putting out the chairs (have Regino help you). Also: Regino wanted some “no parking” signs, they are an my desk as well.\r\n\r\n    304\r\n    Needs a tidy (guest checked in, checked out after 20minutes). Please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    SAFE\r\n    As per BL (beautiful Laura) the safe shall be locked at all times.\r\n\r\n    Great job, everybody. You rock my world.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 2:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Map paper is ordered. As is some more coffee for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    Busy busy day.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2009 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    The rate sheet is found in My Documents, Front Desk, Earthbox Pricing\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2009 at 6:26 pm\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEET\r\n    Khai, where on the computer is your fabulous new rate sheet?\r\n\r\n    CHAMPAGNE\r\n    Is here, yeah!\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Morgan, can you please order some more map paper?\r\n\r\n    323\r\n    needs to be cleaned, please let HK know.\r\n\r\n    TOMORROW\r\n    Stefan will work 9-2 (o.ked by Cindy) and I will work 2-10. That should cover us.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    Kept timing out on us today. Please print tomorrow’s check-ins, so we know what’s going on.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2009 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    Did you get the e-mail I sent you?\r\n\r\n    Also, will you check out res. 1644971. They paid cash for the room it looks like, but they charged a 10% deposit to her credit card, and they wanted to pay with their gift certificate. The gift certificate is in my box…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2009 at 5:38 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ RESERVATIONS\r\n    New quirk, no biggy, but we need to pay attention: when a Unirez reservation comes in, WRP doesn’t assign a room anymore. It has been doing this at Bird Rock ever since the software update, but here at EB only for a couple of days. So: what’s a team player to do? Easy.\r\n    1) process payment (watch out, it reverts to the full amount, not the 10% deposit, so move the comma).\r\n    2) go to edit, confirm reservation, then save.\r\n    That’s all, does the trick. Why is it doing this? Nobody knows. It’s the machines, they are taking over, ahhh, aahhhh….\r\n\r\n    UPCOMING RESERVATIONS\r\n    Please go through all upcoming reservations and make sure we meet guest’s needs (ground floor, etc.), have vouchers, addressed all questions (interested in Kayak, etc.). Next weekend is going to be big and we want to shine!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 10:38 pm\r\n\r\n    QUESTION\r\n\r\n    Does anyone know what is wrong with the internet? We have had a lot of complains about it not working or having a very weak signal where they should be getting perfect reception. Some of them say it only works at the bathroom :) . Can we have someone take a look at it?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    I finished the new rate sheet. If anyone finds any errors on there, let me know. All the old copies that I could find have been replaced.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, I think that is all.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2009 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all.\r\n    Not much to report.\r\n\r\n    One of the bike’s chains has fallen off. We have parked it next to my apartment door. I will ask Seth to fix it or, once I am not wearing this nice white shirt, I will try and fix it.\r\n\r\n    Sadly the T.A. 2000 has met with irreparable damage. It has been retired to the trash. Let us hope we do not need it’s services until we obtain a new model.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 7:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everybody, since there is no room in the gift shop I had to put most of the XL and XXL men sweatshirts in the storage room so if anyone asks for one they are in a box which says MEN SWEATSHIRTS on it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy, but good busy….\r\n\r\n    INTERNET OUTAGE\r\n    Centurytel & Rockisland are doing some repairs tonight. They should be all good to go by 6AM. Just in case something goes wrong, I printed tomorrow’s check-ins and housekeeping report.\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEET UPDATE\r\n    Khaili, I didn’t get to that today, will you do us the honors?\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    Please look at our amazing merchandise. Oh, so chic! Khaili and Stefan, can you please take an inventory tomorrow and put it in my box?\r\n\r\n    POOL DOOR\r\n    Is in, yeah, Seth! Looks fantastic. The spring for the door will be installed tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE\r\n    One of our guests will need a ride to the airport tomorrow at 8AM. Regino will pick her up (I talked to Raquel) by the lobby and give her a lift.\r\n\r\n    WEDDING\r\n    There are a bunch of gift bags on the back desk for a wedding tomorrow. We have no reservations for most of the guests listed on the bags. I gave the wedding coordinator a call. She (Becky) will get back to us with further instructions.\r\n\r\n    Thank you so much for being our gift shop king tonight, Stefan. You are a clothing rock star!\r\n\r\n    Michael Jackson died today:(\r\n\r\n    Cindy and Laura, have a wonderful time off. We’ll miss you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 4:54 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW PLANTS:\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody! You know those dead bushes in front of Building D and the brown grass by the side of the driveway? Well, they are all getting replaced next week. Island Gardens will be spending most of next week digging these areas up and putting in a whole new bed. It will all look very pretty when it is done. Hopefully it won’t cause too much havoc, but to avoid any headaches, please let our guests in Buildings D & E know when they check in that there will be a bit of landscaping work being done and if they have any problems just to let you know.\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday!\r\n    steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2009 at 1:26 pm\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK SUPER FUN STAFF MEETING\r\n    Please join us (and by that I mean: this is mandatory) on Monday, 7/6 at 3PM for an Earthbox front desk staff meeting. In case you can’t make it, please let me know ASAP. Thank you.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW that special is really working so far we’ve had around 10 online reservations. One thing I noticed though is that when you make a reservations the add-ons are not there. So maybe that is something we should have a look at.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 5:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you Khaili and Stefan for organizing the back storage/bathroom area.. HURRAY…. Steffi, I had Khai bring back the towels, sheets and blankets to housekeeping, we left 4 pet blankets up here though. We have enough people on staff this time of year that we shouldn’t need all those extras all the time, there just it not enough room.. :)\r\n    There are some white shirts on your desk, they can be for BR..\r\n    We have a temporary fax/copier in the front office, I will be ordering a new one but this one should be fine for now, thank you Chris Teren for lending it to us..\r\n    Coffee shop\r\n    Because we have the 3rd line in the office also ringing out at the coffee shop, (so Miss Lilly can assist in answering phones) You will notice that when someone is calling the coffee shop either directly or on the extension it will also ring in the office, it comes thru with a double ring, like a internal line but it says something like VM/FX… on the console and phone displays. Just give the coffee shop a few rings to pick it up if you know Lilly is out there. If not pick it up and be your lovely self..\r\n    Lilly\r\n    Don’t forget when you leave for the day to turn the ringer off in the on the phone in the coffee shop…\r\n    Thanks everyone..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Thank you so much for the inventory of the bag, I went back to Post San Juan and it is now on its way to Germany!\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Please check reservation #1597166 and bag is in Steffi’s office, you are a rockstar! :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2009 at 8:56 am\r\n\r\n    DRIP COFFEE…is back inside and will be complimentary as it was before…seems a little weird for guests to have to pay for drip coffee in the morning and then at 3 when Cafe Zia closes, the coffee is free.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2009 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    San Juan Transit came by today and gave us updated schedules. They are the bright yellow schedules, I threw the green ones in the recycling bin. Also, another good thing to know is that Island Tours and Taxi will give guests a tour of the island for $60.00. I placed their cards by the other taxi business cards.\r\n\r\n    Have a great night!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 6:11 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE SCHEDULE\r\n    I had to change the schedule a little. Eliot, Carla, Morgan & Elena, have a look, please.\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    The Java goddess told me is open: 7AM to 3PM.\r\n\r\n    GERMAN BAG\r\n    Carla, I itemized all the content for the bag one of our German guests forgot (great fun), but I can’t find the original return slip anywhere. Can you please follow up on that? Thank you!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE COFFEE\r\n    I ordered coffee for the Wind Place, it should be here later on today or tomorrow. They come in packages of 25.\r\n\r\n    GIFT SHOP\r\n    We are working on the gift shop, it is looking great!\r\n\r\n    NEW EARTHBOX SHIRTS\r\n    The new Earthbox shirts are here, WAHOO! Every employee gets 2 shirts, if they would like to purchase more, rip the tag off and put your name on it and place in Cindy’s box.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2009 at 4:11 am\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of notes.\r\n\r\n    Coffee is ordered. At least I left a message on their phone. That usually works though. :)\r\n\r\n    I drained and refilled the jacuzzi tonight. It was done close to 3ish so hopefully it will be warm in the morning. The pool had a lot of use from the Bell Ringer kids tonight. I worked on it too so hopefully it will be fine in the morning.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2009 at 7:46 am\r\n\r\n    Hey everybody, we are out of our Budget Gourmet coffee for the drip coffee. Has a new bag been ordered? Or do I need to call it in today? Let me know!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2009 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    JETTED TUBS\r\n    Please remember, only rooms 301 through 306 have jetted tubs. One of us promised otherwise today. So, 301 through 306 jetted tub, 307 a little larger than the other water places, no jetted tub. All water places in building D: little balcony, but no jetted tub.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    Please write all add-on info in the guest remark section, don’t forget to write which provider, what time of the day, which day, how many people and, my favorite: fee added, confirmed, voucher made in there. (See #1645764, Morgan, please go over this with Eliot).\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    Please write confirmation number on room service tickets, so we can double check if the charge has been applied.\r\n\r\n    WESLEY BELL RINGERS\r\n    Will arrive on Sunday. Morgan, please prepare remote check-in and have your spiffy rooming list handy.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. Stefan and I will work the night of the 4th, since we have nothing to be independent about. Morgan is scheduled until 10PM. I promised him he can leave early if it’s possible. Bring us food!\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back. We had such a great time camping on the Nooksack River. I love to be the first camper of the season, a little chilly but the calm you feel sleeping outside to the sound of the river is priceless.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2009 at 2:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey gang! Just wanted to give Morgan a heads up for Saturday morning. I placed a post it note (ok’d by Steffi, ha! ha!) on the back phone console, please set two wake-ups for Sunday. You are a rockstar!:)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2009 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hellllooooo again! I had a busy morning!\r\n\r\n    RACK CARDS\r\n    I organized all the rack cards up at the front desk. I kept the ones that we use the most in the rack holder. Everything else is filed in the top drawer in the black filing cabinet. I made some new folders so you might want to take a peek at it. I also filed them in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n    RATES FOR ROOMS\r\n    Please be sure that you are checking the room rates before editing a reservation. I have had three different reservations that had a changed rate when edited. It is very important that we do not overcharge a guest especially if we have already quoted them a price. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    When opening in the morning, we do not have to make drip coffee for the front desk. Lily will be serving coffee out at Cafe Zia. If Lily is not open for some reason, we will make coffee for the front desk.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2009 at 2:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Earthboxers! What a great day today…it is nice to see Lily again. Cafe Zia is now officially open for service! Just a thing to note: Lily will be having drip coffee out the pool so we no longer are serving it here in the lobby. Have a great night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 16th, 2009 at 10:08 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Graduation everyone… Jacob is officially a high school student! WOW I am not sure I am ready for this..\r\n    Steffi~Morgan had a great time, even my Mom heard about it.. :) You deserve it Morgan, for all your hard work..\r\n    Pool\r\n    Morgan have you heard back on getting the guy here to evaluate our pool/hot tub situation?\r\n    Pool Door\r\n    The new door should be here next week, Seth will install it when it arrives\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Lilly and Cody are officially opening.. YAH… Remind all of our guests at check in about Cafe Zia, we will have muffins, breakfast sandwiches and some other snacks.. Along with coffee of course and fruit smoothies..\r\n    Patio chairs\r\n    Please keep all the chairs organized, if you walk by the sitting area outside 308-311 and the chairs are in disarray, please tidy them.\r\n    Happy Tuesday…\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2009 at 1:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Just want to let everybody know that we have envelopes in the back office which are for the Michaan Wedding. We have to put an envelope in each room before guests check in it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2009 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    NOT SO FAST\r\n    Guys, we had our first “guest selected kayaking online, was charged, nobody booked anything” event of the season (#1661107). No biggy, Stefan handled it like the pro he is. I really hoped we could get away this season without printing out each online reservation. And I still think we can. Just consciously look at the add-on options before you process the reservation, look at it again after you processed it. All good? All good!\r\n    Also: don’t forget to look through upcoming reservations when you have a minute (and we all have a minute during each shift) and look through each reservation’s add-on section. Just be excellent, that’s all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2009 at 5:10 pm\r\n\r\n    HEURISTIC DELIVERY\r\n    Morgan, Elena or Khaili (who else is working that morning shift? ha ha): Tom with Heuristic Enterprises will deliver stuff for Cafe Zia tomorrow. Please put it in Cafe Zia’s freezer immediately.\r\n    311\r\n    is dirty, please let HK know.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2009 at 9:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Great night tonight! Isn’t the weather just beautiful? The beach cruiser bikes were very popular this afternoon. I am on countdown until summer break….only 4 and 1/2 days of school left, wahoo!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2009 at 1:45 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning Khai,\r\n\r\n    I talked with Raquel about the late check-out situation for Sunday Marathoners. She says that she is ok with a 1pm check-out if people request it. She would, of course, prefer an earlier time but if people need until 1 it’s ok. Just let her know. What she would also like you to do is to make sure you keep her posted with what rooms have checked out. That way she can get the housekeepers going. Just call her cell. Just so you know, in case anyone asks, I guess there is supposed to be some sort of expo or something after the race in the parking lot here. That’s about all I got. seez ya.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2009 at 10:48 pm\r\n\r\n    That’s it for the night everybody is in. Nothing exciting. 1634239 should stop by tomorrow pls read guest remarks\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2009 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy- When Carla and I were checking people out we noticed that there was a negative balance on the following reservations: 1648540, 1645042. Just wanted to let you know.\r\n    Other than that, all is good :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2009 at 12:19 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing, when you process a payment, under the 2nd option called “TRANSACTION STATUS” section you need to make sure you select process payment, otherwise the payment will not take, after you select that, under the 3rd option “GUEST STATUS” you will need to select process payment again, you will know if you did not select it right under section 2 because 1. when you hit process payment (under section 3)it will take you to a screen that only has an arrow and no detail of the payment 2.a payment will not show on the guests main screen. Please ask me if you have any questions…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2009 at 12:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool Door\r\n    Our pool door is giving up, Seth is going to try and adjust it once more so that it will close on it’s own, but I would still like us to make multiple trips walking to the pool a day to check to make sure that the pool door is closed. We have a new door that is being ordered. I will post when I find out when it will be here.\r\n    WRP\r\n    If you notice anything that isn’t working quite right on the new version of WRP please make sure you email me with what it is and an example so I can pass it a long.\r\n    Mail\r\n    Please try and make a mail trip on Saturdays.\r\n    Please read notes in reservation# 1444709..\r\n    Have a super weekend.. Smile, enjoy and be happy..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hola Stefan,\r\n    please read my email right away. I’ll be there at 12:30. Have a great shift.\r\n\r\n    Happy busy weekend everybody. This should be fun!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 12:18 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT!\r\n\r\n    Yes, it is. Remember to keep your cool during these hot days. Things that can help…keep the windows open, keep a fan on, breathe, drink lots of water, take a break when you can, have a margarita with the guests, ok, maybe not that one, but you get the point…enjoy it!\r\n\r\n    PANDORA.\r\n\r\n    Enjoy Pandora, but please don’t make any new radio stations or edit the existing one without asking me or Adam first. Thanks!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2009 at 9:00 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I put out some more business cards, the extra ones are in your office on the shelf, they are in a white box.\r\n    Air Conditioners\r\n    I really want to make sure that EVERYONE is telling EVERY person making a reservation, if the room they are choosing has A/C or not, remember water places and sun places are the only rooms that do. If we make this VERY clear we will not run into unhappy guests because they did not know about having no AC..\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    stefan Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 8:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow San Juan Florist are going drop off a bouquet for a guest who is checking in tomorrow please make sure that it is in the room. They will give the name with with the bouquet\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 8:14 pm\r\n\r\n    #1602607, #1602612, #1645647\r\n    A group of 8 lovely ladies. The reservations were made for 4 rooms at different times and when they arrived to split the bill it was a little difficult. Couple of things:\r\n    In the future, if somebody wants to add a room, please add it on the existing reservation. If it’s a different room style, please write a note in the guest remark section.\r\n\r\n    Then: their invoices are in my office. Due to all the splitting up, they still owe us a little money, please have a look at the reservation. Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    FRIENDS\r\n    Please don’t have your friends visit you at worrk. If you want (and can) take a 10 min break off property every once in a while, that’s fine, but please don’t have them hang out and visit.\r\n\r\n    BUSINESS CARDS\r\n    We are out. Stefan and I couldn’t find them in the Cedar room. Where do we have more?\r\n\r\n    I love the weather. Thank you, sun!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2009 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    I hope you are still loving the sun.. It is so great :)\r\n    I just ordered 6 small refrigerators for the rooms, they will be arriving in the next few weeks. Please let me know when they arrive.\r\n    Happy Wednesday :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2009 at 9:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a roaster today! Lovin’ this sunny weather! :)\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    I made some more spa vouchers but could not figure out to print more pages on the pretty clear paper. We need to do that so we can make more.\r\n\r\n    Hope everyone has a great rest of the week!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2009 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    WALK-INS\r\n    Please remember folks that when you are taking any reservation that you need to at least get their phone number or email address. This is important as people tend to leave things behind in hotel rooms. We can’t always depend on them remembering that they forgot an item. Thank you! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2009 at 7:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning beautiful Sadie!\r\n    Please call M&W Auto first thing in the morning (378-2886) and make a 2 day reservation for #1638511. Have Wendy from M&W come and pick guest up. He would like the cheapest car available around 9AM. He will pay them directly.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Morgan!\r\n    Please go to Post San Juan and send the wallet back (on back desk).\r\n\r\n    ELIOT & KARLITA (we decided on “Karlita”, since we got a “Carla” already)\r\n    Welcome to the team! Glad to have you.\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I gave 312 a sheet pan from the Orca kitchen. Can you please let Raquel know to put it back after the guests check out?\r\n\r\n    MICHAAN WEDDING\r\n    Please read email regarding this wedding.\r\n\r\n    GUEST WASHER\r\n    Now I’m confused. Somebody moved the “out of order” sign from the older (not broken, just flips breaker when going into spin cycle) to the newer (not broken) washer. Can one of you ask Regino if he knows what’s happening there, please?\r\n\r\n    Happy first shift Stefan. Happy Monday everybody.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2009 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    will be gone tomorrow, he will try and call\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2009 at 7:24 pm\r\n\r\n    ADA ROOM INQUIRY\r\n    Elena, I forgot to ask Regino for the ADA measurements. Can you please follow up on that on Sunday?\r\n\r\n    AC\r\n    T’is that time of the year. Please get in the habit of telling all our guests that most of our rooms don’t have AC when they make reservations. All rooms in building B & D have AC, but the others don’t.\r\n\r\n    SJI MARINE CENTER – 378-6202 – BY THE CLOCK DOCK\r\n    They rent kayaks and nice easy to steer boats. And they offer catered picnic cruises. The boat costs $80 per hour. A Cyntia’s Of Course catered lunch, brunch or Sushi basket costs between $12 & $15. Sounds like tons of fun.\r\n    They brought us fliers. If we refer somebody, write your name on the flier and give it to the guests. For each Kayak referral we’ll get a free kayak rental. For each catered cruise we’ll get $5, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Very pleasant day, lot’s of walk ins and phone reservations. We have guests from every continent tonight. Thanks to Karla we were able to help a gentleman from Guatemala. And I got to try my rusty French. We could have used Morgan’s Japanese skills, but oh no, Morgan is off island having a life (kidding, you deserve it!). And there was a Lina & Stefan sighting. Yeah! Welcome back you guys. I’m so glad you will be joining us again this season.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2009 at 1:44 pm\r\n\r\n    WALLET\r\n    There is a red wallet with a Post San juan Slip all filled out on the back desk. It was left behind by one of the elderhostelers. Please take to PSJ ASAP.\r\n\r\n    ADA\r\n    We had someone call and inquire today about the height of the toilet and bed in the ADA room. I asked Regino if he could get measurements when he had a minute today. The phone number is on the back desk\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2009 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    The blinds don’t close correctly due to the string being all messed up. Elena, can you please have Regino look at that on Saturday, it’s a stay-over.\r\n\r\n    GUEST LAUNDRY\r\n    The older guest washer flips the breaker when it goes into the spin cycle. I put an “out of order” note on it and have Seth check it out on Monday.\r\n\r\n    Made more pet policy packages. Fairly quiet tonight and so very very gorgeous outside.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2009 at 9:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Wasn’t the weather great today? Everyone needs to bust out their shorts! (Well Morgan has been in them for months already!) :) Pretty quiet night. I did not take the garbage out because there was hardly any and did not want to waste the bags. Hope everyone has a great weekend.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2009 at 8:59 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM 312\r\n    The guests said that the bathroom lights would not turn on at all. I offered to move them to 314 but they said they would be fine. Please offer them a discount at check-out if they seem upset\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2009 at 1:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Vinny’s\r\n    Hey all. Just letting you know that we are now doing dinning vouchers with Vinny’s Italian Restaurant. We will get a voucher record for it in the folder shortly. Please ask Cindy or Morgan if you have any questions but, it shouldn’t be any different that what we’ve done with the other restaurants.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2009 at 8:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hope you all had a great Memorial Day Weekend! Wahoo!\r\n\r\n    Morgan – the tea guy did not call. I put your list of teas “that we had plenty of” in my inbox. Do you have an inbox? I could not find it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2009 at 10:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Holy Moly. They kept me running tonight. oi.\r\n    Several things:\r\n    - 325 is blocked out and is going to need a tidy. I had to move them to 109 because she was handicapped and after being in 325 a little while they realized they really needed better access. They do not have a dog so it’s all good.\r\n    - 214 is blocked out because it needs a comforter. 216 spilled water all over theirs and I needed to replace it and didn’t know where to find an extra. I don’t even think we have extras. Do we? Please tell housekeeping that I set the comforter and the green blanket in housekeeping. Thanks.\r\n    - Just a heads up. I am going to work a while on it but, I can’t guarantee the condition of the pool in the morning. For a long time tonight there was WELL OVER the maximum bather-load in there. At one time I counted 28 people in the pool. Children everywhere! Oh the humanity! I tired telling people that they had too many folks in the pool but they just kinda looked at me like I was stupid or they would move but as soon as I got back to the office they were all back in. sigh. Either way, the pool is starting to turn and I will do my best but, I just wanted to warn you just in case I am unable to stop it. Keep your fingers crossed.\r\n    - We really need to get some more pool towels. We churned through ALL of them within 2 hours. Housekeeping even washed them twice today.\r\n\r\n    Khai and Sadie, good luck with check out. Sorry I was not able to prep any Elderhostel stuff. It’s a very small group and several of them are already on the island if not already in the hotel. Be strong.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2009 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy busy morning. Lots of late check outs and early check ins.. SURPRISE :)\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I made an alarm for you for res. 1625004.. this is just a reminder to check on that.\r\n\r\n    If anyone comes across a pink ball in the pool house, please return it to these nice people; 1625966\r\n\r\n    Other than that, not much to pass on. Bikes were very popular today. I can feel summer right around the corner :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2009 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a ride! I felt like Neo in the Matrix, just doing things faster and faster, without loosing my cool (and without the really hot tight leather pants:)\r\n\r\n    FANS\r\n    We will need to provide fans in all the earth places. People were hot tonight and I brought fans to as many as possible.\r\n\r\n    POOL TOWELS\r\n    We ran through every pool towel in the house. I had to put some room towels out for our swimmers. Please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    WRP\r\n    WRP was funky today. Didn’t keep charges, didn’t adjust invoices after you made changes on the reservation, erased walk in reservations if you forgot to put in the source code, froze up. Really weird. Let’s keep an eye out and tally the problems if they persist.\r\n\r\n    214\r\n    Door doesn’t open. I think it’s just the batteries. Wrote maintenance request and blocked out the room.\r\n\r\n    Other than that no major issues, couple of little things I wrote into the guest reservations. Thank you Morgan for helping me through the mid-day ferry rush. Almost sold out. One more ferry to go. Sleep well, all our wonderful guests and have a fantastic day tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2009 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    OFFICE HOURS\r\n    Starting today our office will be open from 8:00AM to 10:00PM on weekdays and from 8:00AM to 11:00PM on Friday and Saturday. Night people, please adjust your schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please put the American flag up on the lobby building. Also: next Tuesday Cindy will send to down to BR for a couple of hours to train with Debbie, just so you know.\r\n\r\n    This weekend is going to be a biggy. Wonderful weather. It’s going to be great.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2009 at 9:00 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday…\r\n    Seth\r\n    Seth will not be working this weekend, and will have Monday and Tuesday off as well.\r\n    Taxi\r\n    If you have scheduled to have guests picked up at the hotel for a departure, and you have authorized the hotel to pay for it (you authorize it by asking Cindy or Steffi) you must leave a note in the guests profile, and also give the taxi cab driver your name.\r\n    Payroll\r\n    Oh My, I almost didn’t have the paychecks done today, I lost a week (when I was out of town) and forgot (I don’t know how) that today was the day, so please thank Steffi for reminding me:) THANK YOU THANK YOU STEFFI….\r\n    Kate is here, she is our first student that has arrived for the summer, she is from Moldova, please welcome her and give her all your local islander hints..\r\n    Parking\r\n    It is the time, everyone must park there cars up by building A or on the street. (unless you know for sure when are not busy)\r\n    Happy Memorial weekend to everyone..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Sadie Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 1:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!\r\n\r\n    Sooo we’ve solved the mystery of who’s luggage is to be delivered to us tomorrow. I spoke with a woman from British Airways today who had no clue of who’s luggage was being shipped or why it was being shipped to our address. SO we discovered that it was our new employee, Kate’s luggage. Mystery solved. Apparently, her luggage should arrive on flight #6340 with Kenmore Air around 1:00PM? We do need to make sure Regino goes to pick up the luggage since they do not deliver.\r\n\r\n    Oh, and such a gorgeous day outside! It’s so nice to have the door open and a breeze flowing through the lobby.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 8:42 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Morgan….\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2009 at 8:29 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday, Morgan!!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2009 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    I just refunded those guests. Everything is good to go :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2009 at 1:31 am\r\n\r\n    Well I just got woken up by some guy pounding on the lobby door. Upon coming down to speak with him he complains to me that he can’t get in to the room he rented. He proceeds to show me his keycard as proof he has a room. It’s a Best Western card. I sent him on his way and he was very apologetic. You know you’re drunk when not only can you not work your door lock, you are attempting to open a door at a completely different hotel. Just thought I would warn you Khaili in case you have some guest wanting to feed you some horror story about someone trying to break into their room. I only hope he was trying to get into an unoccupied room. *sigh*\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2009 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Khai\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of thing you will need to take care of. I had some problems with a couple of guests. As part of resolving those problems we settled on refunding a bit of there room. Obviously you can’t refund the same day so if you would, could you do it? I am sure these folks will be asking for updated copies of their invoices. Reservation #’s 1614434 & 1615805 just need the amounts shown refunded. Thanks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2009 at 6:36 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    Tomorrow between 9AM and noon a tech from Centurytel will be here and fix our guest computer modem. If for some reason Chris is not around, please call him. Guest computer works for now kind ofish.\r\n\r\n    MAIL\r\n    Please go and pick up the mail tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Dude, it was busy today. The phones were ringing like it was 1993 (what?).\r\n\r\n    HALF ASLEEP IN FROG PAJAMAS\r\n    When we went down to Seattle last, Daniel said: “Let’s stop by La Connor and see Tom Robbins (he lives there). So we went and right as we were looking for a parking space there he was. Tom Robbins. How cool is that? So then in Seattle, when I woke up on the air mattress of my friend the next day I saw this book on her book shelf “Half asleep in frog pajamas” by Tom Robbins. Read all his books, didn’t know that one. He wrote it in 1995 (what is it with the 90ties today, Steff?) and it’s about a female Filipino stock broker in Seattle, who deals with the fall out of the stock market crash back then. She also deals with a 300 pound psychic and the disappearance of her boyfriend’s jewelry stealing monkey (well, you know Tom). This is a fantastic book, could have been written yesterday, like a roller coaster ride. If you need a fun read, this is your book.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2009 at 8:32 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    will not go online. Left message with Chris. Please follow up with him. Many guests are interested in using it.\r\n\r\n    Happy rainy day everybody.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2009 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUP BOOKINGS\r\n\r\n    We will have some guests who already have reservations calling in over the next few weeks to add their reservations into an existing wedding group for August 7/8. If you don’t know how to link existing reservations into an existing group, just ask!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2009 at 3:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all. Couple of things.\r\n\r\n    *Victoria Clipper*\r\n    Please make sure you check the Vic Clip block release emails. Even though the boat isn’t running they are still booking trips. I found a reservation from Saturday that wasn’t made. Please do not delete the block emails. Just hit reply to them with any pertinent info added and move the emails to the “Clipper” folder in Outlook.\r\n\r\n    *Angevine Middle School*\r\n    1 – All the kids filled out paperwork for the bikes and Mike Medina has signed off on the stack of them. The kids can now check out bikes. They must wear their helmet. Let Mike know if any kids are seen riding around without one.\r\n    2 – Mike has requested to get a van run for the kids out to the Labs on Thursday the 14th. It will probably take 2 trips and they need it around 2:45. I hope that will be ok. Perhaps Regino or Seth could do it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2009 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    What a great Fiesta we had. Thank you so much, Laura, Adam, Cindy, Raquel & Regino for making this happen.\r\n\r\n    Elena & Khaili, Sunday Goddesses, please read the emails. Couple of things you’ll need to know about.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Carla, for making vouchers. And yes, Elena & Khaili, please make some more.\r\n\r\n    Happy Mother’s Day all you brave women in my life who raised and keep raising wonderful kids. You have all my respect. And I hope all your rascals are spoiling you rotten tomorrow!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2009 at 12:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy sunny saturday everyone! Can’t wait for the party tonight! Yummy! Wanted to let you know that I made a bunch of vouchers, we still need more made, it is that time of year!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2009 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Tamales are made, pig is dead, margarita mix is bought, Let’s party! I can’t wait.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2009 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday:)\r\n    Ivan from Western Prince would like to take us all on a excursion in the next few weeks on their new boat. Here is the description:\r\n\r\n    WESTERN EXPLORER\r\n\r\n    New for 2009, the “Western Explorer” is a 27′ Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat, similar to the boats the Coast Guard uses for search and rescue. It is the only US Coast Guard certified Rigid Hull Inflatable in Washington State. The “Western Explorer” seats 15 guests and cruises at up to 30 knots, getting us where we need to go quickly. To ensure your comfort, every guest receives a full length Coast Guard approved anti-exposure suit.\r\n\r\n    Can any of you employees make it for a trip on the afternoon of the 27th? If note let me know which date that week would work for you.\r\n\r\n    PARTY PARTY\r\n    Don’t forget tomorrow is our annual party.. YUMMY.. 4-7pm… see you all there.\r\n\r\n    Dishes\r\n    Please if you are on shift and you see there are dishes in the sink, and you are not busy, please wash them..\r\n    Don’t forget to vacuum it can always be done, in the lobby and behind the desk.\r\n\r\n    Brian from SJI Outfitters was going to do a kayak demonstration tomorrow during the party, he has hurt his back and may not be able to do it, BUT he is still going to be here and will have a drawing for a free kayak trip.\r\n\r\n    Savage Roofing was here. Anyone interested can ask me what the end result was.\r\n\r\n    Have a GREAT weekend…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2009 at 1:58 pm\r\n\r\n    DIRECT BILLS\r\n    Just a reminder to all, including myself, that when we do a direct bill we need to put the signed copy of the invoice in Cindy’s in-box. That way she know to send out the bill. THANKS!!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2009 at 10:01 am\r\n\r\n    Hello all……\r\n    On Saturday around 10 or 11 am Paul Hopkins is going to come and set the tent up for the party.\r\n    Have you noticed the BEAUTIFUL cherry trees in full bloom…\r\n    They are spectacular.\r\n    Keep up all the wonderful work everyone…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2009 at 8:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Everything went smoothly this evening. I did the remote check in for the group tomorrow. They are lined up on the back desk. Oookay, that’s all. See you soon :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2009 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday, Cindy!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2009 at 4:57 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Morgan, can you please go to the bank on Monday and get us some change?\r\n\r\n    SUSIE’S MOPED\r\n    Morning Gods & Goddesses, please don’t forget to put Susie’s Moped on display outside the pool patio each morning and securely tuck it away each night. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Got some walk-ins today. Thank you, spontaneous people!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2009 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey strangers!\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    I miss you. See you next week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2009 at 8:34 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ\r\n    I didn’t hear back about the Unirez reservations that may or may not be duplicates.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    They will come by tomorrow for the check that is on the back desk.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2009 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Gift Shop\r\n    Whew… Took most of the night but I finally got everything priced and put out. All excess magnets are enclosed inside the small magnet display. All other extra items like books, playing cards, and ornaments are in the small box under the back desk. Hope that’s good.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2009 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    PET ROOMS\r\n    NEW AND OLD POLICY\r\n    Poor dogs they were lonely:(\r\n    Please make sure at check in that ALL guests know that dogs are not to be left unattended in the room. This has been our policy for as long as I remember but I don’t think it has been followed as strict as it should.\r\n    All pet rooms MUST have a pet registration filled out, and NOW on it will be a local contact number just in case someone decides to leave their lonely little pets unattended..\r\n    MORGAN~please revise the pet policy today, and put together some more pet packets.\r\n    312\r\n    Opalco is going to put a nifty little device on this room so we can try and locate where in the world the power is tripping out at, so please DO NOT touch anything in that room, once the device is in place I will turn the heater and lights on so hopefully it will cause the issue to happen again.\r\n    Enjoy ALL the sunshine… you never know it might snow tomorrow:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2009 at 12:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Pet Rooms\r\n    Ok folks. I don’t know about you all but I think from now on we need to make sure we have the cell phone number of anyone staying in a pet room. I got called several times last night because a guest’s dogs were constantly barking. The guest was not in the room and the only phone number I had for them wasn’t their cell. These dogs barked for several hours before the guests finally came back. Let me know what you think. Should we make this a policy? Thanks!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 18th, 2009 at 12:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Pretty busy this morning. Reservation #1563253 left her watch. I have talked with her, and she is going to have her friend pick it up by the end of the week. She will be asking for it by name. The watch is in the safe in the envelope with both guest name on it. 4/18/2009 cm\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2009 at 2:38 pm\r\n\r\n    We have some great tickets to give a way to our guest that will be with us on Sunday evening. Please ask the EB front desk if you have a guest that is interested. The showing is a tribute to Roy Orbison, there are 2 showings one at 4pm and one at 7pm, both showings are at the SJC Theatre. Be sure to offer them to guests who will be here. Thanks everyone have a good weekend. :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 16th, 2009 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Spring everyone! Just wanted to let you know that reservation #1528458 has borrowed the scrabble game and they will bring it back in the morning. San Juan Safaris also called to remind us that our staff can join them on their whale watching tour tomorrow at 1:00, just call them in the morning so they know who is coming.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2009 at 1:04 pm\r\n\r\n    THE FUTURE\r\n    I updated the event calendar on our website through June. Check it out, lot’s of stuff going on for the centennial celebration, cool tours and lectures. Be informed and let our guests know.\r\n\r\n    #1561268\r\n    Has a cash deposit in the safe. Please have Raquel check the rooms when they check out, before you give the deposit back.\r\n\r\n    UPGRADE\r\n    Please remember to upgrade our guests whenever we are not too busy.\r\n\r\n    Wonderful day, lot’s of walk-ins & bike check outs. We have to have Seth do a bike maintenance day next week (wrote slip).\r\n    Welcome home Laura & Adam, it’s good to have you back!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Nice and quiet night here on Earth. I do like the new location of the key maker so much. Thank you, Seth!\r\n\r\n    ERROR MESSAGE\r\n    I get an error message every time I click on the EB website. Does anybody else have that problem? I’ll contact Blizzard tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2009 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Seth is our hero….. He built a nifty little pull out draw at the front desk for a key card machine, the keys fit right behind it so now, we don’t have to turn our backs to our customers. Thank you Seth….\r\n    Mail: If you are the morning person on Saturdays and you see mail that needs to be put in the outgoing mail before Saturday afternoon, please bring it to the post office. Thanks..\r\n    We are all inspected, passed with flying colors.. HURRAAAAY..\r\n    Happy Thursday..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2009 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Just an FYI, if Robin’s Nest calls. They sent us an invoice for flowers we ordered. At the top they just said “Valentines Flowers.” I left a message w/ Robin’s Nest asking them to let us know if they have the names or at least the reservation numbers for the rooms we ordered the flowers for. The invoice is in the top inbox on Cindy’s desk. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2009 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a heads up for the 4/8 morning crew. Just got a call from the state inspector and he will be up in the morning to do he usual “every 2 year” boiler and water tank inspection. He said that he would want the maintenance guy to show him around so I have already warned Seth. Please give Seth a call when the inspector arrives. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2009 at 4:47 pm\r\n\r\n    DUCK SOUP\r\n    Well woohoo! Duck Soup has reopened a little early for the season. Through April they will be open for dinner Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. In May they will add Thursday to the line up. Keep in mind they will not be open for dinner on April 12th and May 10th. Those days they are serving brunch in honor of Easter and Mothers Day respectively.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2009 at 7:39 pm\r\n\r\n    WIFI PASSWORD\r\n    Please do not ever give our wifi password out to people who aren’t our guests.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE ROOM\r\n    Regino will shampoo the carpet in the exercise room on Monday night. He will come around 9PM, so it will be dry the next morning.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Their big boat is in the shop, but they will take their new and exciting zodiac out at noon and 3PM over the weekend. The zodiac is big enough for 15 passengers and looks like fun, fun, fun.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, weather, for being wonderful some more. Lot’s of smiling, happy people checking in.\r\n    Happy Birthday Zoe, fellow Aries, have a fantastic day!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2009 at 8:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello! The TV in the Wind Place is broken so I took a TV from 115. (A big thanks to Seth, who came in and hauled it up to the house!). I did not know how to block out room 115. The pool was busy this evening, lots of kids tonight! It looks like the rain is finally going away. I am so ready for some warmer weather!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2009 at 8:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone! All is well tonight. I think we may be out of hot chocolate. Brian from San Juan Outfitters dropped off his rates and schedule for Summer 2009. He has a great new paddle boat that can be rented, it looks so cool! He is also renting stand-up paddle boards! Check it out! Tomorrow is April Fools Day, watch out!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 30th, 2009 at 10:55 am\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone-\r\n    I blocked out 311 for a week and filled out a maintenance request as per Raquel. She said the left side of the bed frame is broken\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2009 at 1:23 pm\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    I talked for a long time with Ivan last night about the oddity that everybody charges $75 per person for a whale watch trip this season, but Western Prince charges $76, why, why, why?\r\n    Western Prince gives 4% of their profits to salmon restoration organizations. No salmon – no whales – no whale watch tours – no visitors, get it? He said, he thinks he owes that to our environment. I loved him for that.\r\n    So, having said all that, he doesn’t want us to go through the trouble of manually changing the whale watch price every time we book with him. We can just leave it at $75.\r\n    Western Prince goes out daily at noon.\r\n\r\n    ADVENTURE VOUCHERS\r\n    I’m almost done updating our adventure vouchers for the season. I simplified them some, easier to read, cleaner looking. What do you think?\r\n\r\n    FERRY SCHEDULE\r\n    New ferry schedule will be in effect tomorrow. I’ll bring schedules up later today.\r\n\r\n    Dude, it snowed at my house this morning. How does that go, March comes in like a lion goes out like an ice bear?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 25th, 2009 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    MAINTENANCE LOG\r\n    Cindy & I want to keep a log of completed maintenance tasks. Laura created a log on my computer (desktop). Seth will input the maintenance slips upon completion.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL EARLY ARRIVALS\r\n    When taking a reservation for Elderhostel guests arriving early or staying after their program, please print out their reservation and put it in the “Elderhostel early arrival” folder next to my computer. Morgan and I will make sure the guests stay in the same room, once we get the rooming list from EH. Thank you for letting us know, Laura:)\r\n\r\n    YOGA VOUCHER\r\n    Adam is creating a new and exciting special soon, involving yoga class add-ons to reservations. New yoga vouchers are in the voucher file with the other current adventure vouchers. Stay tuned for more info!\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    Will have a sailing this Saturday at 1PM and will start to go out on th weekends at noon.\r\n\r\n    ISLAND CULINARY TOURS\r\n    Naoni from Hillside B&B is offering culinary tours this season. There is a 2 hour walking tour for $35 touring local restaurants, bakeries, delis and specialty food shops. And also a 3 hour shuttle bus tour for $50 visiting local farms. Flyers are under white board. She offers a free shuttle tour to farms on 4/3 from 1-4 and a walking tour on 4/4 from 10-noon for us tourist industry professionals. Call her to sign up: 378-4730\r\n\r\n    SPRING SPRING SPRING\r\n    The hummingbirds are back. I planted vegetables. The flowers are blooming. Finally. Man, this was a long Winter.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2009 at 5:07 pm\r\n\r\n    JAN VAN:\r\n\r\n    My mom’s green toyota van is parked in the back. If you need to move it for any reason, the keys are on my desk.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2009 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINE\r\n    Woo hoo, it looks like it might finally get fixed by next Tuesday or Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Morgan or Cindy or Steffi or whoever does the room assignments these days…I took a reservation (1533861)for some folks coming in on the May 25 trip. They will be arriving on the 20th and I put them in a Sky place. Any chance they can stay in that room for the duration?\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 8:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday everyone! This is going to be a great week! Cindy, I left a note on your desk. I did all the reservations for the month of April. Whew! That is a task! Hope you all have a great week and I will back on Saturday.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Just an FYI~\r\n    When you are booking a whale watch, the price that is in the system is good for all operators except for Western Prince they are $76.00 per person instead of $75.00. So if you choose to book with them remember to increase the rate in the reservation you are making.. Please leave the default rate as it is though.\r\n    PLEASE PLEASE, I am also reminding you, mark rooms as clean when you get the housekeeping report.. More often then not the rooms have not been marked clean, when I come in in the morning.. That is something the afternoon shift should do, when they get here, verify what is clean and mark it clean. (I have to say though that Morgan you are super good doing this.. Thanks)\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 12:45 pm\r\n\r\n    So you know if I’m taking the time to post something on the blog, I must find it important (witness the previous post):\r\n\r\n    Please, pretty please, don’t forget to mark rooms clean when you get the list from housekeeping.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 12:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Steffi!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 10:01 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEFFI……\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2009 at 9:58 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY MONDAY… Our blog is getting lonely:(\r\n    Have a great week everyone..\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    swim suit\r\n    There is a swim suit on the chair in Cindy’s office with a Post San Juan slip all filled out. The guest would like it shipped out tomorrow if possible\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2009 at 4:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Guest 1506947 called because she left her bathing suit in the room. Regino brought up a black bikini with polka dots on it. I left msg with guest. I didn’t get her mailing address. See notes for more info.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2009 at 9:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi guys. Happy Monday. I think I left a brush in the pool room on Saturday. If found, can you please put it on my desk. Thanks!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2009 at 8:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone\r\n    It’s been a while. Anyways, there was a laptop charger left in the room under res #1458017. It is on the back desk, please try and call them. I called this evening and left a message for them. Res #1506947 thinks they left their bathing suit. I went and looked in housekeeping but didn’t see anything. Please check with housekeeping in the morning.\r\n    Wish for sun for me :) The rain and snow has saturated our softball field and we need it to dry up so we can practice outside, instead of in the gym. Speaking of softball, we have our first home game on Friday at 4:30 up at the elementary school field. We also have a double header here on Saturday. You all should stop by!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2009 at 6:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Gorgeous Carla!\r\n    The conference center is all set up. Please make sure to let Raquel know to turn the heat up and maybe provide some space heaters.\r\n    Also: please have Raquel tidy 314. The guests checked in, but were expecting 2 separate bedrooms and checked back out. thank you.\r\n    Have a great shift!\r\n\r\n    Morgan, world traveler!\r\n    I hope you had fun in Seattle. I have a little job for you on Wednesday, 3/18: we have a small order which we need to pick up from the food co-op (nothing which needs fridgeration, just 4 gallons of personal care products & granola). I gave them your number. They’ll call you when the order comes in. Will you please get a check from Cindy, pick up the order and drop it off at Bird Rock? Thank you, Thank you!\r\n\r\n    Also: where is the front desk phone charger, anybody?\r\n\r\n    Miss you all:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2009 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    We have a memorial service in the conference center this Saturday. Carla, I made a key to the room, it’s in the little magnetic key basket.\r\n    Please, when reserving the conference center, always asked:\r\n    1) From when to when the event will take place (what if guests arrive before we open the office?)\r\n    2) how the room shall be set up (let Raquel know a couple of days in advance)\r\n    3) what the event is\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2009 at 8:56 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone, brrrrrr! It is cold outside. All went well this evening! Hope you all have a great week, I will see you this weekend! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2009 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Had to revise the schedule once more. Please have a look. Thank you all for working so hard and bearing with us.\r\n    Much love\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2009 at 2:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday everyone.. WOW the weather is beautiful, and the crocus are blooming in the garden.. Spring is coming..\r\n    cindy Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2009 at 2:44 pm\r\n\r\n    I am testing..\r\n    TechieChris Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2009 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy EarthBox People! I revamped the WiFi login and changed the password. Make sure to check the printed invoice for the new password, or ask Morgan or Cindy! The new password is effective NOW!\r\n\r\n    Cheers!\r\n\r\n    Chris\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 11:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy busy busy!\r\n\r\n    305’s heater is broken. Maintenance request filled out. I blocked it out until tuesday. I moved these guys to 203.\r\n\r\n    306’s toilet needs checked on. It is leaking and doesn’t like to flush. Maintenance requested filled out. I also blocked this room until Tuesday. Morgan, make sure you don’t book anyone in this room tomorrow because it wouldn’t let me block it out since there is going to be someone in there until check out.\r\n\r\n    Happy Valentines, everyone\r\n    ♥\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 12:53 pm\r\n\r\n    OK. Due to a guest bringing a pet unannounced 203 is now the hold room. *whew*\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    Crisis semi-averted. 335 called to cancel so we now have that as a hold room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 9:21 am\r\n\r\n    218 is no longer a hold room. Somehow it got unblocked (or something) and it was booked online in the middle of the night. We do NOT have any emergency hold rooms. I will talk to housekeeping about the status of 109. I don’t know what happened.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2009 at 8:37 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TO ALL OF YOU!\r\n    Laura, Adam and I bought you all a box of yummy chocolates to share, they are from SJ Florist, who is now making home made chocolates.. Enjoy.. Thank you for all you all do..\r\n    We all completely sold out, except for 218, which is a hold room in case of an emergency.. Khaili, you may sell it after 6PM if you can..\r\n    Morgan, if you have time this morning, please put all voucher in envelopes with a foiled chocolate heart on the outside (like I did yesterday) to make it extra special..\r\n    REMEMBER all of you to spread the VALENTINE CHEER, (even if you don’t feel it) A LOT of people went the EXTRA mile to make a special night for their sweeties..\r\n    All the bikes are back on the property, remember to keep them locked up at night and during the day. If it looks like it will rain tonight put them inside the pool fence, under the cover (at least as many as you can).\r\n    NO ROOM SERVICE FROM: Back Door Kitchen is closed but they will reopen on the 19th of Feb.\r\n    311 had a bit of a leak in the room, Seth tried to fix it by caulking on the roof above and vacuuming where the slow leak was coming through the ceiling inside the room, the guests where totally fine with it, it was not a big deal and was a really slow drip.. Hopefully it has a TEMP fix for now..\r\n    Remember to pass out the word, we would love for guests to post on Trip Advisor.. When they get ready to leave at check in, say: Once you get into your room please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.\r\n    Happy Day.. Enjoy…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 12th, 2009 at 7:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Alright, Sweethearts, this weekend is going to be a big one!\r\n    We are almost sold out. Be excellent and kind; I know you always are:)\r\n\r\n    209\r\n    We have a check in in 209 tomorrow (Friday). I opened it without Raquel’s o.k. Please make sure it’s ready.\r\n\r\n    YES, WE CAN\r\n    Please know that guests interested in a multiple night stay may book this. Simply open an earth place for Friday or Sunday respectively.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS & THINGS\r\n    Cindy and I were the voucher making queens today. I went through all reservations and made sure we have all vouchers. I brought some more trays and champagne buckets from BR. Morgan, please double check all vouchers again tomorrow, just to be on the safe side. A list of upcoming romance packages is on the white board.\r\n\r\n    RESTAURANTS\r\n    As of right now, The Place and Vinny’s still have seatings for Valentine’s night early (like 4ish) and late (after 8).\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCH\r\n    Brian at SJO has 6 spots left on his cruise on 2/14, 11:45AM out of Roche.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Our spa is booked 2/14, has one opening on Sunday 2/15 at 5:15. Spa d’Bune still has spots for this weekend.\r\n\r\n    WORKING OUT\r\n    Cindy brought flyers (spelling?) for the new fitness center on Beaverton Valley. They have day passes for $10. The flyers are next to our white board.\r\n\r\n    SATURDAY\r\n    Morgan will open, Elena will be there with him noon to 3. Morgan will stay through the 3:35 ferry with Khaili. Khaili will be the night goddess. Please bring towels, shampoo, heaters and everything else you think Khaili will need at night into our office, so she doesn’t have to leave if a guest needs something.\r\n\r\n    I’m at BR at all hours of the day. Call me if you need something.\r\n    We can do this! Go team Earthbox!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2009 at 9:00 pm\r\n\r\n    334\r\n    is dirty. I moved the guest into a different room. Please make sure this gets cleaned tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    118\r\n    Can be rented on Valentine’s weekend if we need an additional pet room. Please note, the room only has a small TV. Please let potential guests know.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    will re-open on 2/19/09. They will be open for dinner Wednesday through Sunday and will serve Noddle Bowl Lunch on Mondays. We got to go check that out, yum, noodle bowl.\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    I left a message with Barry’s Insulation, re: cc authorization, waiting to get their fax number.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow:)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 8th, 2009 at 2:20 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    We are starting to get reservations and adventure/massage requests for the summer (yippieh ya ye). I would like us to start including the arrival date when we create an alarm, as in: book massage for 7/31/09 arrival. We would set an alarm like that for the beginning of July, but then, when we glance at the alarms in a hurry, we know, we don’t have to deal with booking this right this moment. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\n    BLANKET\r\n    The guest who lost her blanket called back, all set to go to Post San Juan tomorrow. Morgan, she is so grateful that you strolled through town, found the blanket on a park bench, called and made sure it’s hers. Your effort really meant a lot to her and she wanted you to know that. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2009 at 10:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Steffi-\r\n    The Rack cards are on Cindy’s computer. They are placeholders until we get the real thing…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2009 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN & KHAILI\r\n    Please make some more spa vouchers. Then go through the Valentine’s weekend reservation and make sure all the vouchers are made.\r\n    We will be busy, yeah, yippieh, yuchu!\r\n\r\n    I love our new rack cards. On who’s computer are they?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2009 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    Just an update, I have opened 301-307 for Valentines weekend, Raquel will be working on getting them ready.. Sell away..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2009 at 5:43 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    We had to make some schedule changes and the schedule for Valentine’s week is up. Thank you all for your flexibility these days, we appreciate it!\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHING\r\n    Whale watch tour prices will go up to $75 (SJS)/$76 (WP) per adult this summer. I switched the prices in WRP. Morgan, will you start updating our vouchers accordingly, please?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2009 at 5:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Steve from SJ Coffee, fixed the espresso machine.. YAH\r\n    Also he adjusted our drip coffee maker and said he should no longer be making bitter coffee.. HURRAY…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 28th, 2009 at 9:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everybody,\r\n\r\n    CHAMPAGNE\r\n    I ordered 2 cases (one for each hotel) from Market Chef for the big Love & Presidents Fest coming up. Please let me know when they call.\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    lacks internet. I tried to call Chris, but only got a busy signal. Please try to call him again.\r\n\r\n    332 & 336\r\n    are all repaired and clean and ready to go. Yeah Team Earthbox!\r\n\r\n    # 1445612 at Bird Rock is all taken care of. Thanks Khaili.\r\n\r\n    Super deep thought of the day:\r\n    History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 28th, 2009 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Dell order: I ordered a toner cartridge for Adam’s printer so if it comes in, please just set it on my desk.\r\n\r\n    Great review: I want to congratulate all of you for the great review you received on Trip Advisor. Nice work!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2009 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone.\r\n    It was a relatively busy night. I have three walk-ins! Yay! :)\r\n\r\n    Anyways, I got an e-mail from the call center about Reservation # 1445612 for Bird Rock. He didn’t want his room to be canceled and he wanted me to call him so he could keep the room. I called but it rang and rang and rang. I recommend reading the e-mail and his reservation notes so this makes more sense. Sounds a little sketchy to me…\r\n    Well, I’m headed home. I’m not scheduled for a while, but I’m sure I will be around.\r\n    See you all soon!\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 23rd, 2009 at 7:51 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Will you please have a look at the new booking section. There is an alarm and a new booking needing your attention.\r\n    Thanks for the new cool phone list. I added the Bird Rock emergency phone number:)\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Work-out queen and little brother watcher! Can you go through our “made voucher” folder and throw out vouchers for treatments and ad-ons, which didn’t take place, please?\r\n    Also: will you vacuum the lobby by the end of your shift, please?\r\n\r\n    Steve from San Juan Coffee worked on both, our coffee maker and the espresso machine. Our coffee maker has some weird adjustment issue (wants to live in the tropics?), that’s why the coffee is a little bitter. He is working on it. And he may know what part we need for the espresso maker. To be continued…\r\n\r\n    I’ll work a double at Bird Rock. I may have to go home for a half an hour and may utilize one of you to take the BR phone during that time.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 22nd, 2009 at 5:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a couple of little things:\r\n    I had 3 walk-ins, hoot, hoot, yippieh!\r\n\r\n    311\r\n    is blocked out for a couple of days. Seth caulked the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you please take all the Christmas deco staples off the office walls (around fire place, along trim, etc.). Also: can you please vacuum pool & hot tub. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    INTERESTING FACT\r\n    Did you know, that when tested, all but Italian and Australian wines had very high levels of heavy metals in them? I knew I liked my Sangiovese for a good reason.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 20th, 2009 at 1:28 pm\r\n\r\n    I have added a new group folio please check out the notes in group name: NWSDB\r\n    Morgan & Steffi (actually all closing people) during this cold time, let’s keep the office thermostat at 60 when you close at night.\r\n    Vacuum: Please remember to empty the canister when you use the vacuum.\r\n    Morgan: please finish the phone list, make sure you add any new phone numbers on.\r\n    Morgan: Reservation #1448317 needs a call about the massage they would like, please see their reservation in BR.\r\n    Remember to vacuum and dust when you are the closing person. There is SO much time it shouldn’t be a problem..\r\n    Thanks everyone.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 20th, 2009 at 1:33 am\r\n\r\n    The no show finally came in. He’ll be coming in for his receipt in the morning. I didn’t want to wait around for the computer to fire up.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 19th, 2009 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    G’mornin! Just a couple of quick things:\r\n\r\n    1 – #1429654 is a no-show at closing.\r\n\r\n    2 – Cindy, apparently I don’t have the power to turn off those Unirez alarms on the BR WRP. I have emailed Kyle though so hopefully it will be resolved.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 16th, 2009 at 11:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everybody,\r\n    It’s good to be back. Nice and busy the last couple of days, lot’s of reservations. Yeah! Maybe we get some walk-ins with the weather being so sweet.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 16th, 2009 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, the 2 weeks have gone by FAST… Welcome back everyone… Here are a few things to get you started..\r\n    1. Dept of Health (shell fish & water dept) will be making reservations they will be honored the per diem rate.. Ask me for questions.. This will be honored Sept 30 thru April 1..\r\n    2. Rack Cards and Business Cards: Business cards will be here by the end of the month, and the rack cards should be done in 30 -45 days (hopefully sooner, I will know more on Wednesday) If someone needs paper information please see Steffi or I.\r\n    3. There is a leak issue (not currently happening but did during the snow period) Savage Roofing will be stopping by to check it out.\r\n    4. Seth will be in on Monday 1-19-08\r\n    5. Tory will be back on the island around the 29th of Jan.\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend, and welcome back everyone..\r\n    Cindy :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 5th, 2009 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Jan 5, 2000\r\n    It is so quite in here :( Laura and Adam and I are like quiet little mice.. Working away.. Happy 2009 everyone.. I miss you all and we will see some of you on the 16th of Jan..\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 31st, 2008 at 2:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Hellloooo Earthbox Staff! I just wanted to wish everyone a very HAPPY NEW YEAR! Can you believe we are going into 2009? My how time flies! All was quiet here at the front desk today. I guess the next time I will be in here, the Christmas tree will be down….boo-hoo….it looks so pretty. This is my last shift for winter break. Thank you for letting me help out, and I will see all of ya in the summer! :) HAPPY 2009!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 29th, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    $$\r\n    Cindy will put out the paychecks on Thursday, 1/1/09. I will be in the office 9AM to noon. Come and get ‘em! Please don’t deposit before Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 28th, 2008 at 3:03 pm\r\n\r\n    FERRY FOR FREE SPECIAL\r\n    We have a new special. See the email I wrote or check out http://www.guidetosanjuans.com/index.cfm?action=sji for more details.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE SHOP PIPE\r\n    Seth checked out the broken pipe, we won’t need a plumber. He will be able to fix it once the snow is melted.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Morgan, will you be a snow angel and start taking the Back Door Kitchen menus & cover pages for room service (keep those, please) out of all rooms, please? I would like to get this done before our closure. Reminder: Back Door Kitchen will be closed until mid February.\r\n\r\n    I’m out, I’m out, I made it off the mountain, yeah!\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 26th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Glad to finally see the rain again (never thought I would say that!) The roads look a lot better, I can see the pavement….yahoo! This morning went great. I cannot believe that Christmas is over already! I hope everyone had a great holiday and I will see all of you next week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2008 at 10:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Forgot to blog…\r\n    Well sorry for the delay in blogging this though I have told Steffi. There was a burst pipe under the coffee shop sink thanks to Morgan who walked by and heard the running water and was then able to shut the water off underneath everything is fine for now but hopefully we can get a plumber on this as soon as Christmas passes\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 23rd, 2008 at 2:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Things are looking up. My phone is working again. D & I dug out the cars yesterday for 2 hours, only to firmly lodge them in the snow on both edges of the driveway. I have such a muscle ache. Well, Chris and Jerry will bring provisions to us later. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    312 is blocked out until further notice, upgraded a reservation to the Wind Place.\r\n\r\n    Please read email regarding a possible 5 night stay 1/15 to 1/20.\r\n\r\n    I miss you guys. Keepme posted.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2008 at 9:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Snow snow snow! There is so much of it.. poor Steffi, she can’t even leave home.\r\n    Its been a calm night, nothing exciting to pass on.\r\n    Christmas is only three sleeps away :D\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    December 22nd, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW! Can you believe all the SNOW! I think it must have snowed another 5 inches overnight! It is so beautiful outside! I had a great morning and all went well. I love all the Christmas decorations that are put up in the lobby….it is so festive in here! I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas! I will see y’all at the end of the week! :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 21st, 2008 at 2:01 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m experiencing technical difficulties. Not only am I snowed in, I also can’t recieve phone calls (my phone doesn’t ring, regardless of which phone I use and where I plug it in). So, Elena will work my shift tonight (thank you, thank you, thank you). We’ll check in tomorrow. My internet is working. Please email me if you need to get a hold of me.\r\n    Cindy and Laura, would you strap liquor, wood and steaks around Roxy’s, Zeus’ and Thor’s neck and send them up here, please?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 9:21 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW, 312 is a problem child.. Dave and I were off island so he could not come and check it out right away. Dave will talk to Steffi tomorrow, BUT until we have it fixed we will shut that room down after the party leaves that is in there now. Steffi can you make sure this room gets shut out after Dave comes in. THANKS SO MUCH..\r\n    SNOW SNOW SNOW.. It is so beautiful. I love it. While we were on the mainland today in the midst of all the chaos (believe me it was CRAZY, bumper to bumper traffic from Mount Vernon to Burlington) I am reminded again of what a beautiful peaceful place we live, the chaos is just a ferry ride away when you are in need of it.. But to come back to this quiet laid back place is a real blessing..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    All is good with 312, gave a little discount and keys to 314. These folks are so nice. They come here every Winter.\r\n\r\n    I told a local, Gary is his name, he could use our pool for $5 per person tomorrow. He knows this is an exception and not something we offer when it’s summer.\r\n\r\n    I went to the Farmer’s market this morning. Man, no produce whatsoever, everything is frozen. But I got some delicious ravioli from the new San Juan Pasta Company, so yummy.\r\n\r\n    This storm tonight will be brutal. Stay warm, be kind, check on your friends and neighbors and call if you need something.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I took care of most everything this morning. They didn’t want to move. I got them a couple of extra luggage racks a new alarm clock. BUT THEN… They realized that their bathtub was not draining so I had Regino go in. He tried everything plunged it, pulled tons of hair our of it with a wire and ran some Drano but didn’t have any luck so, I stuck a note on their door explaining the problem and offered to have them either move to 314 just next door or open the adjoining doors so that they don’t have to move but can use the bathroom in 314.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 20th, 2008 at 1:48 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Good morning Elena. I just need to let you know something for tomorrow. The folks in 312 will be moving to the Wind place for the duration of their stay. 312 started having a weird electrical problem. For safety’s sake they wanted out of the room but they needed something with a kitchen. Since the Wind place has been unoccupied for the last several weeks; it was their idea to wait until Sat to move in. I went in and turned on all the heaters in the place tonight so it would warm up for them. I don’t know if he is going to be wanting a deal or anything but feel him out when he comes in to get the keys. You also need to call Dave in the morning to let him know about the electrical problem. Apparently the power went off briefly to the bed side of the room and that the lights in the bathroom and by the beds were dimming in relation to the thermostat setting. Strangely enough the lights dimmed when he turned down the thermostat then stayed dim. The power flickered out then came back on in full a few moments later. The guest is concerned about a possible short, thus prompting the move. Sorry you have to deal with this. Please let them know that the house is set up as two kings. They have three adults and a child so they should be ok. I just hope it’s warm enough in there by tomorrow morning. Please call me if you have any questions. Laters.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 19th, 2008 at 3:05 pm\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Will close for the season the day after tomorrow. They will open again mid February. So no more room service for our guests until then.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Will be closed until Monday 12/22 at 1PM. Guests, front line & staff is informed. Please check BR’s WRP. Thank you guys.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    December 17th, 2008 at 12:50 pm\r\n\r\n    MERRY CHRISTMAS!\r\n    I’m so sorry that we had to cancel the Christmas party. I was looking forward to some holiday cheer with all my crazy cohorts. In the absence of that, Adam and I have given you each a little card which is in your box.\r\n    Here’s hoping for a white Christmas…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 15th, 2008 at 4:08 pm\r\n\r\n    STORM SPECIAL\r\n    As per Laura we are offering rooms for $50 plus tax to islanders affected by the cold snap (power outage, frozen water pipes, tree fell on house, etc.)\r\n\r\n    UNIREZ UPDATE ERROR ALARM\r\n    As per WRP the above mentioned alarms occur due to the new WRP interface and have probably to do with Unirez trying to update availability during our January closure. Please turn those alarms off as they occur.\r\n\r\n    Stay warm, be kind and jolly.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 15th, 2008 at 3:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Monday Morning:) I hope everyone is staying warm..\r\n    A few things:\r\n    I had a phone call this morning from the Lisa who works at the Blair House, they have some international students staying with them who go to Spring Street school, they have time restrictions on how late the students may go on the internet and she said they have been logging on to our wireless after their normal hours that they are allowed to use the internet at Blair House. So with all that, we are changing our password. Please make sure that if someone calls for the password, that they are calling from a room, and if they are not, ask them if you can call them back at their room number, or ask them for their name. This should eliminate the chance that people are just calling for the password acting as though they are one of our guests.\r\n\r\n    Since we are so slow this week, our office hours are shortened, we will decide per day how late we will stay open, if you are the person closing and you leave early don’t forget to call Frontline.\r\n\r\n    Office party\r\n    We are going to try and reschedule the party for January. We will let you know what date, if anyone has any date restrictions please let me know.\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 12th, 2008 at 7:12 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    The schedule through January 25 (I kid you not) is up.\r\n    As per Laura we will close early today. Morgan will staff the front desk from 11-7 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    It started to snow on Cady Mountain and Shaw Island is out of power. Oh goody. Stay warm everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2008 at 7:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan!\r\n    Please read email regarding travel writer, she will probably call tomorrow.\r\n    Also: Laura’s father came to visit tonight. He is in 323, scheduled to check into the San Juan tomorrow. Please check with Raquel when the San Juan will be ready for check in. Tory will open BR at 1PM.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 11th, 2008 at 3:59 pm\r\n\r\n    PARTY\r\n    Yeah! Don’t forget our staff party this Sunday. Bring a snack and a white elephant gift. We gonna have us some fun!\r\n    Elena: please bake a bunch of cookies on your Sunday morning shift for us, will you? Morgan: please haul the galvanized tubs into the office and fill them with ice on Sunday.\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    If Kyle stops by, please tell him we’ll need keys to the file cabinets under Cindy’s computer and the ones next to the bathroom door.\r\n\r\n    BALD EAGLE\r\n    When I drove to work today, this child size bald eagle was sitting on Egg Lake Rd and ate some tasty roadkill. It didn’t move when I drove by, just looked at me, from 3 feet away. I know, Bald Eagle, not really news to us, right? But to see those majestic birds so close, blows my mind every time.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    December 9th, 2008 at 10:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Puget Sound Blood Center\r\n    The rooming list is made and on the back desk. Tory you can just make keys for them because everything is being taken care of by their office.\r\n    Call me if anybody needs anything from off-island. Remember, I have a small car so no major Costco runs ok? :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 8th, 2008 at 5:51 pm\r\n\r\n    FED EX\r\n    Please send the gift certificate on the back desk via Fed ex to address on fed ex slip (will be billed to guest’s fed ex account, fed-ex pick up is scheduled, thanks Morgan). The only thing I forgot to ask is, how fast guests needs the delivery. Cindy, can you call her in the morning (number on fed-ex slip) and ask, please? Morgan also scheduled the tracking number being send to guest directly.\r\n\r\n    FRONT LINE\r\n    Please always call the call center if you leave early, so they don’t transfer calls to an empty office.\r\n\r\n    TORY WEDNESDAY\r\n    You’ll have a small group check in. I emailed group leader and asked for rooming list and form of payment, look for her email. Also: make keys & invoices ready right when you get here. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    The weather alert says we’ll get snow on Friday. Yeah, just for you, Cindy!\r\n    Khai Says:\r\n    December 7th, 2008 at 9:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Cindy :)\r\n\r\n    I haven’t blogged for a very long time. I need to get in the habit again. Anyways, Raquel won’t be in until 11 in the morning, because there is only one check out.\r\n\r\n    Nothing else too exciting, but I did have one walk in :) haha, yay!\r\n\r\n    Have a great day!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2008 at 9:37 pm\r\n\r\n    YES YES YES\r\n    We won the Christmas decoration contest, yipiehh, E first place, BR third place. Thank you Seth, Regino & Elena! We rock!\r\n\r\n    OMG\r\n    The entire 10th birthday party from 312/314 just marched into the lobby and presented me with the hugest piece of lemon – white chocolate birthday cake. That totally made my day. Nothing like like a bunch of barefoot, giggling 10 year olds in costumes and a load of good old sugar to take your mind off things. Thank you so much, princess guests!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 5th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    The lights outside building A are working. Thank you, Seth.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 4th, 2008 at 8:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan,\r\n    Cindy will be here around noon (kids doctor appt.) Have a great shift, eat your citrus fruit to fight off the Scurvy!\r\n\r\n    Got a handful of walk-ins tonight, yeah! Thursdays are good for that.\r\n    Stay warm, everybody!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    December 3rd, 2008 at 2:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Christmas lights\r\n    Please remember to unplug all the lights when you are the closing person.\r\n    Front office\r\n    I am going to be moving my office to the front office(Steffi’s)for a few months, and I will be taking front office shifts. Adam will be working in my office with Laura during this time. Steffi will move her computer to where the server is.. I have moved most of the things each of you may need to the back luggage room,but if you see something that needs moved from the back to the luggage room for easy access please feel free to move it. This is so the front office will not be the main storage area and it will no longer be a spot of working while you are taking a shift in the front office. Sorry for any inconvenience this may be for anyone. But we appreciate the flexibility..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    December 1st, 2008 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    This is a test, test, Monday, Tuesday, test…\r\n    Oh man, these 1 day work weeks are killing me. Thank you all for making it possible for us to get away. It was fabulous. If you are ever in Seattle, eat at Ocho in Ballard, excellent tapas bar. I actually dreamed about the gambas, yum.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 29th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Well it’s certainly refreshing to see a non-employee making use of the blog. Hey Brian!\r\n\r\n    Khaili the only thing I have to pass on is that the folks in 314 would like a late check-out. I told them 11:30 but if you could ask R/R for a noon check-out they would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!\r\n    Brian - San Juan Outfitters Says:\r\n    November 28th, 2008 at 8:15 am\r\n\r\n    Hello Earthbox staff (Morgan, Tory, Steffi, Khaili, and Elena\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to let you all know that San Juan Outfitters is available for both kayak and whale watch tours tomorrow if you have guests looking for activities. We also have a kayak tour scheduled today, however we have a 70% chance of rain and 20mph winds forecasted. We will see how the weather turns out. Tomorrow is only 30% chance of rain, with low winds. We have been seeing most of our local wildlife: seals, sea lions, porpoise, eagles. Our Resident Killer Whales have been around as well. Call if you have inquiries 360-378-1962. Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\n    Brian Goodremont\r\n    San Juan Outfitters\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 25th, 2008 at 2:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PLANTERS IN POOL HOUSE\r\n    The gardeners said we’ll need to water them in between them coming once a month. So Morgan, could you water them once per week or every 2 weeks if they seem dry, please? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 24th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    FUN WRP FACT\r\n    If you ever have to look up an older reservation and the system says: not found. Go to the reservation desk – search – set time to be searched (i.E. May 2008 – November 2008), then punch in the name or reservation number, and you’ll find it. Yeah!\r\n\r\n    DUDE, WHERE IS OUR VAN?\r\n    Laura has it for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n    FILM TIP\r\n    Deja Vu, a super trippy ferry bombing, thriller, terrorist drama, sci-fi kind of thingy with Denzel Washington. Very cool with lot’s of plot twists which will bend your mind.\r\n\r\n    I want to be called: WATERFOWL QUEEN from now on. Ask Daniel & Dave, they know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 22nd, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    What a nice night. The cold drove our guests into the lobby to stock up on teas and hot chocolate and I spend lot’s of time just chatting, about us, our name change (most people really like the Earthbox name), the economy, Germany, food. It was like hanging out with friends. Thank you, Earthbox visitors.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 21st, 2008 at 10:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Windy!\r\n    The pool was extremely popular today. We ran out of pool towels and I had to use room towels. Please tell Raquel: mia culpa!\r\n\r\n    This is so cool. I have never seen anything like it (on Vessel watch). During the biggest wind gusts all the ferries were huddled north of Cypress Island, like puppies seeking warmth or something.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 20th, 2008 at 7:56 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m the walk-in queen, yeah!\r\n    Thank you, spontaneous people, for checking us out!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    November 19th, 2008 at 1:56 pm\r\n\r\n    there is a blocking card for bird rock in the key cupboard with some small keys on it for the garbage alley padlock. i’m not sure how we are going to work this out for the br opening person…but as of now…that is where the keys are.\r\n\r\n    today went well. nothing to pass on.\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    November 18th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Kyle stopped by to make the key for Steffi’s file cabinet and was all out of blank keys. He said he will return in a few days when he gets more.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 17th, 2008 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Jacob, he is 14 today,, WOW. where has the time gone.\r\n    Morgan found out that our office kitty actually belongs to a guy that lives behind Car Quest. We are going to see if he wants to give the kitty to Ben T.\r\n    It is beautiful in FH today, crisp and clear..\r\n    This is Tere in housekeepings last week, she is leaving on Thursday, Raquel and some others are going to get together on Wednesday night at Downriggers, stop by for a soda or order some food, it is dutch treat.. But we are all welcome..\r\n    Have a great Monday…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 16th, 2008 at 8:06 pm\r\n\r\n    I was just reading around on our website when I stumbled upon “What’s in a name”. It’s a really nice & honest description by Adam about why and how we changed names. This will really help us helping our guests (and us) through the transition. Thanks Adam.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 14th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    KAITLYN:\r\n    Your frames are here in my office.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 13th, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Buddy Kitty hates the vacuum cleaner. Morgan’s car is adorable. The full moon is gorgeous. And that’s all the news.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 13th, 2008 at 11:41 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you Khai, I did mean the key drop:)(I can never make my smiley faces work??)\r\n    Kitty\r\n    Ben T one of our repeat guests wants to adopt our office cat.. I called the Animal Shelter and they have not had anyone report a cat like ours missing. I think Ben and his wife would make an awesome home for our kitty.. It is going to get cold out and I cannot imagine having to let our little kitty sleep outside. Morgan was on board with this… Speaking of Morgan, I CAN’T wait to see your MINI…. CAN I DRIVE IT:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    … that little typo and the bottom of my last post was supposed to be this:\r\n    ♥\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    I love our kitty! Soo cute.\r\n\r\n    Anyways, Cindy, this time, the envelope is in the outgoing mail and properly addressed :)\r\n    Everything was pretty laid back, only two check ins.\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    I left a note for you in your box. Just want to make sure that you get it.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, I will be back on Sunday.\r\n    &heats;\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    I think Cindy meant the key drop box instead of the outgoing mail box when she was talking about the 15 minute signs :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 4:46 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing I forgot, I put the signs for the door (the ones that were tacked on the wall by the old stamp machine with the “we will be back in 15min)) inside the outgoing mail box. I didn’t like the look of all of those signs hanging off the wall.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 12th, 2008 at 10:22 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning:)\r\n    We have a cute white and gray company cat.. We don’t know who he belongs to or if he is lost, Morgan has put notices in all the online papers here in FH, but for right now, that cut kitty is welcome in the office, we have food for it on Morgan’s back porch and a comfy box with a warm blanket:)just make sure you put the kitty out if you are the closing person.\r\n    Please make sure you check the sugar dish in the lobby (often), it gets very yucky…\r\n    During this SLOW time of year, housekeeping is not in the office to clean it as much as they are in the summer, i would like the closing person the vacumn and wipe off the counters, coffee table, coffee service table etc… as well as continue to empty the garbage’s.\r\n    Happy Wednesday..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 11th, 2008 at 10:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena:\r\n    There is a note for you in your box. They wanted your cell phone number but I just told them that you would return their call. It sounded kinda sketchy, but I took her number anyways.\r\n    Cindy:\r\n    That gift certificate, etc. is in the outgoing mail\r\n\r\n    Good night! See you tomorrow.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 11th, 2008 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Hey all! On the days that we answer Bird Rock’s phone we need to print out their reconciliation sheet if we make any transactions. So if you make a reservation or process any online reservations just print out the report at the end of the night and put it in Cindy’s box. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 10th, 2008 at 3:07 pm\r\n\r\n    LOCKSMITH\r\n    I have a call in to Kyle. If he stops by or calls, can you please direct him to my file cabinet. I would like to have a key for it (just the upper part).\r\n\r\n    PRINTONYX\r\n    M, our map paper should be ready tomorrow. Will you swing by Printonyx and pick it up, please? Gracias.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 10th, 2008 at 2:38 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n\r\n    I got a call from the taxi guy tonight and I guess he never came by to get the money. He said he’d be by tomorrow morning to get it. Just a heads up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2008 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    Thank you for fixing Bird Rock’s door. Yeah, little black box.\r\n    Happy foggy night, everybody.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    November 9th, 2008 at 1:29 am\r\n\r\n    TAXI\r\n    Carla, just so you know, we are paying for Friday Harbor Taxi to take some folks out to RH in the morning. The driver will come in after 9 to get paid. I think it’ll be around $24. Just take the money out of one of the till’s and write a note about it and leave it in the cash drawer. THANKS!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 8th, 2008 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK LOG\r\n    BR’s website is down. Which is not the only technical difficulty experienced tonight.\r\n\r\n    SPEIDEN TV\r\n    Doesn’t work. I called tech support, switched receivers, to no avail. The tech support guy said the cable going from the satellite dish to the TV must be broken. I gave the guests a discount. We shouldn’t rent the room until that’s fixed (wrote maintenance request).\r\n\r\n    FRONT DOOR\r\n    None of the keys work even though they aren’t dead. Morgan and I will read it and try to trouble shoot.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    November 8th, 2008 at 1:50 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW! What a WINDY DAY! I have had a great time filling in this morning and all went well. I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend and I look forward to working tomorrow morning!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    And guest starring tomorrow, exclusively here at Earthbox Motel, this weekend only: the amazing, the unforgettable, the wonderful CARLA, yeah!\r\n    Call Tory at Bird Rock if you have questions, for a little bit bigger questions call Morgan, know that Raquel & Regino are here (on speed dial on the phones) for all your van & housekeeping needs. For the really big questions call me at home. Have fun! I can’t wait for the summer to work with you again.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 7th, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    #1369703 – The spa did call back to confirm the cancellation of massage.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    1374434\r\n    K, I think one of us hit “checked out” instead of “cancel”. I canceled it. Thanks for finding it. And thanks again for the fabulous movie tip “War Inc”, I’m still singing “blow me up” in my head. The best ever day-after-the-election movie, ever, really drove the point home.\r\n\r\n    COFFEE\r\n    Steve took our coffee maker, it needs to be repaired. He will try to bring it back tomorrow. Maybe we can get a coffee maker from HK and make a pot that way?\r\n\r\n    Happy rainy day.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 12:52 pm\r\n\r\n    1374434 does anyone know what this is? a mistake may be?\r\n    thanks for checking it out!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    November 6th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Rain rain go away… Sorry Khai I know how you LOVE the rain… I would love it to snow. :)\r\n    I have had to make some schedule changes with the upcoming weeks so please everyone make sure you check the schedules. Tory will you please check with me about something new for next week.:)\r\n    Candles\r\n    I have ordered some more candles when the order comes in can you please put them in my office.\r\n    Have a great Thursday..\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    DVSAS fundraiser – If you get any calls for guests calling for this, please offer them 20% off. By the way, DVSAS stands for domestic violence and sexual assault services.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Khaili,\r\n    Thanks for catching the situation in 310. He was probably just out watching the election results (Go Obama!) I was just waiting to process his massage payment until I talked to Cindy. It’s all good, but thanks for following up on this.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    November 5th, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    Slow night, but it gave me time to follow the election :)\r\n\r\n    Reservation 1373000 was in the new bookings yesterday, but was booked by Laura and only the 10% was charged. I confirmed the reservation, but by closing time no one showed. I looked over by 310 and I couldn’t tell if someone was in there or not…? Laura do you know the deal?\r\n\r\n    I couldn’t get the tree lights to turn on. Seth is working on it.\r\n\r\n    ♥\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 3rd, 2008 at 5:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    Please check Bird Rock’s WRP during the week for new bookings, process them, follow up on add-ons, so we won’t miss things. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 3rd, 2008 at 12:41 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Morgan, please put the bikes under the pool patio cover tonight. Everybody, please start bringing the bikes in & out to protect them from the elements a little bit. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2008 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Khaili, sister of Dillon, the hunter!\r\n    I printed out spa & lodging vouchers with the new logo. Can you please assemble some, or a lot, depending on how busy you are? Have a great shift. We never work with each other anymore. I miss you.\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan, son of Glen, the firefighter!\r\n    Some firefighting dude dropped off your dad’s award (in your box).\r\n    I saved all Earthbox documents in ‘my documents’ – ‘earthbox documents’. Will you please work on the adventure vouchers & the beach cruiser release forms? I’ll do the pet policies on Monday. Is there anything else we need to change?\r\n\r\n    Don’t forget to turn the clocks an hour back tonight. Happy windy autumn weekend everybody.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    The house keeping department will not be here tomorrow. I blocked out departing rooms to be cleaned on Sunday or Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY HALLOWEEN!\r\n\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 31st, 2008 at 3:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Reviews\r\n    Please make sure they are turned in by the end of today as requested by Laura.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Check out Morgan’s GREAT carvings on the pumpkin, great job Morgan…\r\n    Have a great weekend everyone.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    GMMPG (Good morning Morgan, Pool God)\r\n    Happy Monday! Would you please check out the sauna controls? Somebody diddled with it and now the display says it heats to only 45 degrees. Can you also start vacuuming the hot tub every other day? Aaaaand…..will you please work on the pool trouble shooting & maintenance list? Thank you, thank you. I’ll see you at 2.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 30th, 2008 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    PEER REVIEWS\r\n    Please don’t forget to submit your peer reviews & employee surveys by tomorrow (put in sealed envelope in E’s safe with Laura’s name on it). We will conduct employee reviews starting in a couple of weeks, yeah.\r\n\r\n    Also: VOTE!\r\n    I am Steffi, and I approve this message.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena called to let us know that the front door at Bird Rock was open. I don’t think that the timer was turned off. So maybe Seth can run down there and check it out. Also the lights in the front trees are not turning on by the breaker box in the bushes.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    I love the color of our website.. Very nice:)\r\n    Happy Tuesday the 28th:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 28th, 2008 at 8:46 am\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Hey all. Here’s a little closing procedure to add to your duties during the winter. Whomever is closing needs to make sure that pool towels are stocked before you lock up. Since the pool house opens up an hour before the office; we need to make sure there are enough towels to make it though until opening. Thanks all!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin’ Khai’,\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that 105 was dirty. I checked a couple into it and it wasn’t cleaned. I upgraded them to a Sky so they’re hopefully happy.\r\n\r\n    Both Raquel and Regino will not be in on Sunday and Monday. (At least Raquel anyway) Raquel has left her keys and her cell phone to be given to Orozco. Building A is shut down starting tomorrow so Housekeeping may not clean those rooms until Monday. According to Raquel we will only have 4 housekeepers tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    On that same note. If anyone who is in Building A wants to stay over by all means let them. I think the room are just blocked out in the “Unit Closeouts” section. You can unmark individual rooms as needed. I don’t think they will completely shut everything down in that building until early next week anyway.\r\n\r\n    Took quite a few walk-ins today. Glad the weather has been nice to help keep us busy. I made new “Back in 15 minute” signs. They are hung up behind the old stamp machine. There are three. One for the front desk cell, one for my cell, and even a shiny one for you Khaili. They are all done in the same style but with different color schemes. They are also marked on the back as to which cell number they correspond to… What? What’s with “the look?” It’s not like I was “bored” or anything… They had to be changed anyway because they all still said “ELEMENTS’ on them. So there. :D\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 25th, 2008 at 8:34 am\r\n\r\n    Has anyone else had a problem with WRP logging off randomly? I swear I have been on it for 45 minutes and it has logged me on 10 times.\r\n    Frustrating….\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Laura, for a great meeting and yummy pizza, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Cynthia, a local massage therapist, will come by in the next couple of days to borrow two tables from our conference center.\r\n\r\n    Khaili, teen star front desk goddess, please read WRP alarm first thing this morning, you’ll need to go get some chocolate.\r\n\r\n    Took our front desk plunger and brought it to Bird Rock. Kaitlyn couldn’t find one anywhere.\r\n\r\n    Made quite a few reservations for this weekend tonight and had some walk ins. That’s the way, aha aha, I like it:)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    October 24th, 2008 at 4:50 pm\r\n\r\n    THANK YOU!\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for coming to the meeting. Your participation in these meetings is so vital to our organization. I really appreciate it. Not to mention what you do every single day…\r\n\r\n    I have a special thanks to Steffi and Cindy for holding down the fort this summer. You guys are champs!\r\n\r\n    LOTS of love and gratitude,\r\n    Laura\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    Steffi:\r\n    Karla’s keys are in your box.\r\n\r\n    And… umm..\r\n    thats it. haha. See you all soon.\r\n\r\n    ♥\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 3:56 pm\r\n\r\n    OOPS\r\n    332\r\n    The heater is still not working, BUT A new unit will be arriving in about 1 week.\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Is out of order until Friday.\r\n    Friday 10-24-08 1PM\r\n    Pizza at ELEMENTS lobby for all employee’s, discussion about upcoming winter hours and stuff..\r\n    New name… Well as you can see we are in the process of the new name change. Adam and Laura have decided on the Earth Box motel & spa. For now we will still answer as normal. Adam or Laura will let us know when to start answering the phone with the new name.\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 22nd, 2008 at 3:51 pm\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 20th, 2008 at 1:19 pm\r\n\r\n    ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n\r\n    We are trying to make sure that all of the phone lines are transferring to the call center. Only the 378-5800 line should allow going to our message machine. So… what that means is whenever we return a message we need to ask the caller what number they dialed. If they dialed the “800″ number or “4000″ we need to ask if they were transferred here by the call center. There is a chart next to the back phone to keep track of the date and number dialed. Thanks everybody for helping with this.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    Norman Murray is going to come by on Monday morning first thing and look at the leaking out of one of the connectors. Dave will be in on Monday am to look at the heater.\r\n    FYI~Norman’s phone number is 840-9311, he works with Rob, when Rob is unavailable.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 19th, 2008 at 2:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Jacuzzi Update\r\n\r\n    Well sorry to say but we are having problems again. When I checked on it this morning the water temp was in the mid-60’s and there was water leaking out of one of the new connections that was installed on Friday. Dave knows about the heater. We need to call the guy who installed the filter assy. to come fix the leak. I don’t remember his name but Cindy knows it. The whole thing is shut down so it’s not leaking for now. The leak isn’t too bad but it does need to be fixed.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 18th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    101\r\n    Wasn’t cleaned today. Please let Raquel know and make sure it will be cleaned.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Very pleasant night here. Not at Bird Rock, where as we speak the fire alarm went off for the second time tonight. Chris and Seth are excellent, wonderful people and I wouldn’t know what to do without them. I’m going down there now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 2:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Class of 1998\r\n    Cindy has graciously given a special rate for anyone who is attending the FHHS Class of ‘98 Reunion tomorrow. $99 per night rate on everything except the Sea and the Wind Places. Thanks Cindy!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 17th, 2008 at 11:19 am\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    West Mechanical will be here later today to test the relay. Please let them in the room.\r\n    321\r\n    The breaker is replace, that breaker actually runs the vanity area 320,321 and 322, please let me know if anything else happens, try to get as much detail as possible when it happens, that helps with the troubleshooting.\r\n    Men’s Orca Room breaker\r\n    The breaker was tripping because Elderhostel had a portable heater on in their little office. Please remember that we are not wired up to have all those little units going full bore along with everything else.\r\n    Hot Tub\r\n    New part is in and being replaced as I write:)\r\n    Fishing Pole Container\r\n    I have shipped this off to the guests #1259974, if they call let them know it went out UPS on 10-17-08, no charge to the guests.

Chris is working with Rock Island to resolve this. Please ask each upcoming reservation if they would like to use the wireless while they stay with us and make sure you put them in a room that has a strong signal which is all of them but the ones above. The other issue I want to bring up is when room 202 was having problems with his internet two days ago I would have liked it if someone would have offered to move him RIGHT away. I have left a message with Elderhostel to give this guests the opportunity to move. Please let’s remember that it is ALWAYS our first priority to do WHATEVER we can do if possible to make our guests happy and comfortable. That is what we do we are HOSPITABLE..\r\n    New lights are up in the pool area.\r\n    Room 332 is in the process of getting fixed\r\n    Laura will be back tomorrow :)\r\n    Biscotti\r\n    The extra biscotti from the coffee shop is now in the back luggage area, please make sure the plate by the coffee area in the lobby stays stocked so that our guests can enjoy a yummy cookie with their coffee.\r\n    Bob J is working on our phone system, we are getting it resolved but we still have one line that won’t forward to FL, they are still working on resolving that. Please let me know if you discover any new issues.\r\n    Battery Backups\r\n    Chris T bought us some new battery backups, we all all set for if the power goes out…\r\n    312, 306, Wind Place\r\n    I ordered replacement blinds for the above rooms, please let Seth know when they come in so he can install them.\r\n    New Name\r\n    It is coming, we should know shortly… Stand by…\r\n    Fishing pole in back room\r\n    We have called several times to get more information on the address and cc to use to ship this back.

They are in the back.\r\n\r\n    2 – Update on the jacuzzi. A guy from Northwest Hot Springs just happened to be on the island today. (Lucky Us) He took a look at the filter valve and ordered us a new gasket. It should be overnighted according to him. Please call Seth and I when it arrives. Seth’ll get it installed an I’ll get everything running and the jacuzzi reheating. Please apologize to any guests who may be put out by the lack of a jacuzzi. Thanks for putting up with the trouble!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 13th, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy– reservation 1339580 wanted to talk to the manager about the fact that the hot tub wasn’t in service…\r\n\r\n    In the kitchen of 322 there is a plug in that isn’t working. It is the one to the right of the microwave… please have Regino or Dave check it out.\r\n\r\n    The plug for the bath tub in 301 doesn’t fit. Please let Raquel or Regino know.\r\n\r\n    I won’t be back until Sunday…\r\n    Thank you again, Steffi, for rearranging the schedule for me so I could have Saturday off! I really appreciate it.\r\n    Have a great week everyone.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 13th, 2008 at 2:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Well sound like I missed a “fun” weekend. The Weezer concert was excellent though.\r\n\r\n    Cindy asked me to remind everyone. When making a walk-in reservation make sure that if you don’t manually type in the guest’s credit card number in the information edit screen, the system does not save the CC number. Alternately you can swipe the card through in the payment screen and instead of selecting the “Process Payment” button you can select the “Swipe Credit Card and put on File” button. Of course then you have to go back to the payment screen again to actually run the card through for the payment. If you have any questions please let me know.\r\n\r\n    I am going to be doing some pool maintenance this afternoon evening. I will be changing out the water in the jacuzzi and hopefully, if I can swing it, vacuuming out the pool. We’ll see how it goes. Jacuzzi should be fully heated by tomorrow morning. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen,\r\n    our last group of the year is safely tucked away in their rooms. This officially concludes our high season 2008. Great job everybody! And applause, please!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 12th, 2008 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    We are down to the last box of bag tags, Cindy knows and is ordering more.\r\n    Carmen from Susie’s Mopeds came and got the moped for the winter. Morgan, do you know where the helmet is? I couldn’t find it.\r\n    See you tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I love fall :)\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Crazy, crazy night, but all is well. I have survived my first shift alone. A big thank you goes out to KHAILI! You are soooo awesome for staying 3 hours late! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Steffi, thanks for helping out with room service, YOU are a rockstar! Laura, thanks for helping with the “ferry rush!” Hope everyone has a great rest of the weekend!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 9:25 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI & CARLA ARE ROCK STARS!!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 11th, 2008 at 5:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Crazy night!!\r\n    Oh my!\r\n\r\n    read the following reservations: 1344570, 1343171, 1345712\r\n\r\n    I know I am forgetting something but I don’t think it is super important so I think we will be okay.. I’m tired.\r\n    See you in the morning…\r\n    :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2008 at 4:06 pm\r\n\r\n    WELCOME TO GIRL WEEKEND AT ELEMENTS AND BIRD ROCK\r\n    Saturday is gonna be tough, lot’s of check-ins, Carla’s first alone night. Khaili will stay until after the 3:45 ferry, that should help a lot (Thank you, Khai). Carla, sweety, call me at BRrrr any time, and if something major happens I can always run up there.\r\n    Bird Rock: 378-5848\r\n    Bird Rock Cell: 317-6488 (call that if you don’t get through, but need to talk right that second).\r\n    Yes, we can give excellent customer service while doing 45 things all at once, oh yeah!\r\n    And also: there is a humongous tub of sweets on my desk for all of us. It’s a Thank You from Michelle for having her guests stay here with us on her wedding. Go at it, Khaili, you earned it!\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Please remind Regino to look at the heater. Guest said it didn’t work but didn’t want us to check it out right there and then.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 10th, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    POWER OUTAGE\r\n    Wheee! I love power outages. Except when I’m working. Just when we assembled all the parts necessary to hook Elena’s laptop to my cell, and a printer to the battery-backup, the power goes back on. Aarrgh. :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 9th, 2008 at 8:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, ran my little behind off tonight.\r\n\r\n    Here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    The breaker to the men’s room and the hallway keeps popping. Can we please have super Dave have a look?\r\n\r\n    338\r\n    Hadn’t been cleaned. Please make sure Raquel knows and cleans it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    PHONE CONSOLE\r\n    Gave me error messages and didn’t let me do anything. After unplugging it I was able to do wake-up calls (thanks for the tip, Cindy). But I still can’t check in/out guests. It gives me a busy signal and a “wrong number” sign.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please pay Bob’s for the cab for the lady in 207 and make sure Bob knows to help her to the float plane with her luggage (he knows, just remind him, please).\r\n\r\n    THINGS TO DO\r\n    - assemble pet policies\r\n    - roll silverware\r\n    - make gift certificates\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 8th, 2008 at 6:03 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    The Spa also has a Savor The San Juans Special: $10 off any treatment through October (SBS massages count as one treatment). We may pass those savings on to our guests, but we need to make sure to write “Savor the San Juans” on the voucher, or we create a book keeping nightmare. Thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 6th, 2008 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Well 312 is a problem child, Dave and Opalco tightened everything they could and at this point we have to wait until it happens again (if it does) and hope that Dave is close at hand so that he can come right away to see it in action. We have been given the go ahead to rent out the room, SO when and if it happens next please refund the guests for that night and call me ASAP.. The reason we are putting it in service is because it only seems to happen when it is in use. It is very sporadic when it happens. Ask me if you have any questions.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 11:12 pm\r\n\r\n    *sigh*\r\n    Well this was a busy busy night. It feels like summer only worse because there is only one of us at the desk. Thank the gods that I didn’t have to do any room service runs. We are almost all sold out. Only 2 Sun places remain open. I made three runs to the pool house for towels. We are completely out now by the way.\r\n\r\n    - Khai, you need to know about something. I don’t know if you have ever had to deal with a cash security deposit before. The guest #1338229 was a walk-in and paid in cash, including the deposit. The deposit is in the safe but the most important thing is that you let Regino/Raquel know when the guest comes in to check-out. R/R need to inspect the room before you can give the guests their deposit back. It’s rather inconvenient but it’s really the only way to make it work. (Of course you may already know this so I just wrote a paragraph for no good reason.)\r\n\r\n    - We are out of Apple cider in the office. I never got a chance to run back to the Orca room and look for more. If you have chance could you grab some. Or maybe R/R can send some up for you. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n    - I talked to the folks in the Wind house. They put the batteries back in the smoke detector and haven’t had any problems since. The guest in there thinks it may have been dust burning off of the baseboard heaters. Both he and I agree that they were probably the first people this season to turn on the heat so it is a plausible theory.\r\n\r\n    - That’s thankfully about it. I’m going to bed now. :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 3:24 pm\r\n\r\n    I LOVE RAIN!\r\n    See you tomorrow ;)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    October 4th, 2008 at 9:46 am\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    The guests in 312 moved to 341, I refunded their stay last night. Dave is off island today and will be here to check on the issue tonight or tomorrow, until then 312 is marked out of service, all circuits will be set off.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Next week the beach cruisers will delete in size.. We will move all but 6 bikes from ELEMENTS to the off site storage where they will stay dry and warm for the winter. IF you see an upcoming sunny break and we are busy with reservations, please give me the heads up so we can move some bikes back to the property.\r\n    The bikes that are left here, will need to be taken out every morning and put under the cover on the pool patio every night. Of course if it is pouring in the AM you do not need to move them out but if the sun peaks through please move them out..\r\n    That’s it, well done everyone, HAPPY SATURDAY..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    I guess I was a little fast with my declaration that all is well.\r\n\r\n    WIND PLACE\r\n    Smoke alarm went off for no reason. Stay-over guests, please call Seth or Regino and have him look at that tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    M-Dawg\r\n    I hope you feel a little better. Please call me if you need help tomorrow. I run up and help out.\r\n    Carla Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a rainy night! It was fun working with Steffi again and learning all the ropes of the front desk. I got a chance to run down and see the beautiful Bird Rock Hotel. It looks fabulous! I ran into Chris down there, she is sooooo nice! Hope everyone has a great weekend!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Khai, please read #1336844 and #1110183. Must be the rain.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 3rd, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    Has light issues again, same thing, all electricity in the bathroom doesn’t work and the wall where the beds are on, but all the breakers are fine. Left msg with Dave. This is a stay-over. Please try to have Dave come and look at it tomorrow. So weird.\r\n\r\n    All else is good. It is such a pleasure to work with Carla again. Love, love, love having a great crew. Thank you all:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    October 2nd, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone!\r\n    I have a little story to tell you all:\r\n    So, I forgot my uniform at home today and decided to run home at lunch to get it.. only to get all the way out to my house and back to the high school, SOMEHOW leaving my uniform at my house again. What the heck? I also locked myself out of the lobby for the second time tonight. I think I’m loosing it. And no, Cindy, I am NOT on drugs. (She questioned me earlier, joking of course!)\r\n\r\n    Pretty exciting night, actually. I had two room services. Anyways, just wanted to let everyone know that they should read res. #1106523 notes, just to give you all a heads up.\r\n\r\n    Steffi:\r\n    Thank you soo much for dealing with my pain in the butt schedule request! And thank you everyone else who had to cover for me. I really do appreciate it.\r\n\r\n    Cindy: Exciting little note on your desk.. of course if you are reading this than you are probably at your computer meaning that you would have already gotten the note…. I guess I just wanted to say hi :)\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, that is all for now.\r\n    See you on Saturday. ♥\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    October 1st, 2008 at 9:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan some folks from the Elderhostel group will be coming into the front desk around 10:15am on Friday morning and will be needing a shuttle up to the airport to catch a flight at 11:15am and need to check in around 10:30am also a couple will need a ride down to the ferry landing to get onto the 11:10am sailing.\r\n\r\n    Also I wanted to put a little post-it note reminder up for Steffi in the blog about the remaining balance for baggage handling for the group that checked in this evening.\r\n\r\n    Night Night!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 29th, 2008 at 4:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Monday,\r\n    The lights in room 312 were looked at by Dave and he couldn’t find anything wrong with them, so please let him know if it happens again.\r\n    Elena got the stickers done for the cook books. WELL DONE ELENA..\r\n    Winter rates\r\n    Winter rates are upon us, so please don’t hesitates to use them right now for resistant shoppers.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Can you please take the bike on your porch over to the bike shop on Tuesday.. THANKS MUCH\r\n    Phone Charges\r\n    If anyone notices phone charges on a guests bill that ends in the last four digits of #7442, please delete them off the customers record, that is our after hours number.\r\n    Thanks everyone:)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi-\r\n    Please read the notes in res. 1322841. Thanks.\r\n    Oh, and by the way, I can’t figure out how to do those stickers… any suggestions for me?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 27th, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n\r\n    Gooooood morning Khaili! Another Elderhostel group is arriving today. I have made up a rooming list and you are welcome to pre-print out all the invoices if you want. They will probably be trickling in throughout the day so it’s up to you. I hope everything runs soother for you to today than Saturday. I’ll see ya at 2.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 26th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning beautiful Khai!\r\n\r\n    VAN RIDES\r\n    Regino is off on Saturday, so you don’t have a van driver. Please call cabs for people if they need a ride (Clipper, Elderhostel) and we’ll pay for them.\r\n\r\n    310\r\n    is a stay-over and their TV picture is totally fuzzy. I wiggled the cables, but nothing. Can you please make sure Raquel or Morgan looks at that?\r\n\r\n    Wind Place\r\n    is a stay-over and has several light bulbs out. Can you make sure Raquel goes over there and replaces them when she does the tidy, please?\r\n\r\n    Leetle Job\r\n    I left a little job for you on the back desk: making an ELEMENTS logo sticker with our 800 number on it and putting it in the new fabulous cook books we will be selling. The books are $25 plus tax. Please make the sticker, put in books, put books in gift shop.\r\n\r\n    Thank you, have a wonderful day. I’ll be at BR the next couple of nights, call or email me if you need something.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 25th, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    All of a sudden, the bathroom lights, fan, heater failed, as well as all electricity on the wall along the beds. And it was not a breaker. The guests were so super sweet about it. I gave flashlight, a couple of candles and my lighter to them, so they could bathe. We need to tackle that tomorrow (left msg with Seth), the room is rented. M-dawg, please make sure we follow through on this.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, very nice night, lot’s of interesting guests to chat with and time to do so.\r\n    Lina & Stefan Says:\r\n    September 25th, 2008 at 2:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey :) everything’s fine with us :) hugs for everybody :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 11:50 am\r\n\r\n    I am REALLY going to miss all of you (Stefan, Lina, Nataylia and Daniil).. Please make sure you all email me:)…\r\n    Evaluations\r\n    Where are they, I have not found any in my box, please turn them in before Friday.\r\n    COHO\r\n    I went to COHO for dinner last night and it was FANTASTIC.. I strongly recommend everyone going. It has now my FAVORITE restaurant.\r\n    Espresso Machine\r\n    Seth will be bringing the espresso machine inside and installing it in the back luggage room, we shall have espresso at our finger tips..\r\n    First day of Fall, you can feel it, I finally broke down and turned my heater on last night…\r\n    Well done this summer everyone, we had some ups and downs but we made it thru to fall.\r\n    Have a wonderful week..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY:\r\n    As of today, we are no longer taking reservations for the Hideaway. It will still be on our website (and WRP) for a few more days. If you get any requests for the Hideaway specifically, please kindly direct the guests to David Waldron at 360.378.3070.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 22nd, 2008 at 8:04 am\r\n\r\n    VMCCA\r\n\r\n    I went out and took a few photos of the property with all the classic cars that are here. If anyone is interested you can just click on my name on this post and it will take you to my Flickr photo page. Peace!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2008 at 7:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Bye Bye Lina, Natalia, Stefan & Daniel. Is was such a pleasure meeting you and working with you. Have a great life and don’t forget us!\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    September 21st, 2008 at 2:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Just want to let everybody know that San Juan Island Outfitters are going to have Whale watching and Kayaking through out the winter.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Quite night. Nothing very exciting.\r\n    Okay, that’s all… haha :)\r\n\r\n    See you in… eight and a half hours.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Morgan, what a morning you had!\r\n    New schedule is up:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 12:11 pm\r\n\r\n    336 is fixed. w00t!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 20th, 2008 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    Building D problems\r\n\r\n    - Well the new circulation pump that Seth installed barely a month ago failed. Dave thankfully was here in the morning and knew who to call. The pump was replaced relatively quickly with only 2 rooms affected by the lack of hot water. (so far). Discounts were given and everyone seemed happy.\r\n\r\n    - Pool door failed this morning. Thankfully all it needed was new batteries and to be reprogrammed. I took care of it once Stefan got here.\r\n\r\n    - Jury is still out on whether or not 336’s shower will be fixed. He will let us know and we will have to move some rooms around if he can’t get it fixed.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 10:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hokay. Here’s some things…\r\n\r\n    336\r\n    The handle to 336’s shower has broken. We almost couldn’t get the water off. I have given the guests some options and they have decided to stay in the room for tonight. They may ask for the key to 341 in the morning if they want to take a shower. I am fairly certain that Seth is gone this weekend so it may have to wait until Monday. I will try to move the rooms around to accommodate everyone. Maybe Rob will have to be called in. I don’t know.\r\n\r\n    103,104,105, & 106 all want a late checkout around 1pm. They are in the bike race and don’t think they will be done until 12ish. I told them 11:30 but I don’t know if they’re going to accept that. I’ll talk to housekeeping in the morning to see what we can do.\r\n\r\n    #1162115 and #1160114 were no shows at closing. Steffi can you please take a look at #1162115? They were moved to this date and they appear to have a monetary amount gift certificate. Can we still charge them for not arriving?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    will from now on email the daily room allocations to our front desk email. Make sure you print them out, process them and have them double checked. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 19th, 2008 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK FRONT DESK STAFF MEETING\r\n    on Wednesday, 9/24, at 3.30 at Bird Rock. KHAILI will you please staff the front desk at E for an hour?. Elena, Kaitlyn, Tory & Chris, please be there. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 8:17 pm\r\n\r\n    YES, WE CAN!\r\n    It’s the shoulder season, baby. If you check in one of our guests, we have a nicer room available and aren’t too busy: upgrade our guest to the nicer room. If somebody looks frail, is on foot and you don’t have a long line of people, offer the guest to carry her luggage. If one of our guests looks through the menu guide, ask what kind of restaurant he might have in mind, offer to call for opening hours and reservations. Be kind, go out of your way and smile, because you can!\r\n\r\n    NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC’S “GUNS, GERMS & STEEL”\r\n    These are weird times in our country. One way to try to get a handle on things for me has always been to look at how things got the way they are. This 4 part series, which aired on the Discovery Channel (I got it from Netflix) has the simple premise that People’s fortunes hinge on their geography and their contact with guns, germs and steel. It’s history and anthropology at it’s finest. Did you know that the cradle of mankind, the Middle East, used to be lush with trees, rivers, game and grasses? People there moved on after using it all up and dominated other people, simply because those had less protein in their diet. Wow, I can’t wait to get home and watch more.\r\n    Much love!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Stefan!\r\n    Raquel will need your help schlepping some chairs tomorrow around 2. Seth & Regino are not available, so we will need your manly strength. Thank you in advance. I’ll see you at 12:30.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 18th, 2008 at 9:23 am\r\n\r\n    WED. MORNING POOL USE:\r\n    This school year, Zach (a 3rd grader) will be coming to use the pool on Wednesday mornings from about 9-9:30. Please give his teacher the key. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 17th, 2008 at 8:05 pm\r\n\r\n    109\r\n    Lilly, we have a very sweet couple staying in 109. They will need help with their luggage in the morning (to bring it to the lobby to store until they leave). Can you please help them or have Regino help them? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2008 at 6:24 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    is working, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Good weekend, everybody. Thanks for your hard work.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 14th, 2008 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    LAURA:\r\n    A man is staying with us tonight that was on survivor Thailand. I mentioned that you auditioned for it and he thought that was awesome, so if you are here tomorrow he would love to talk to you. His reservation number is 1311638.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 13th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we are sold out!\r\n    Very busy today, lot’s of walk-ins, but nothing Khaili, Morgan and I couldn’t handle. Khaili met a tiny girl guest today, named Khaili. Her mom’s name was Stephanie. Weird!\r\n    New hot tub pump is installed, just needs to be connected, so still no bubbles, but close.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Lilly & Khaili, when preparing EH remote check-ins tomorrow, please make sure all the prices are suppressed.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 12th, 2008 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    iPod Alarm Clocks\r\n\r\n    I know this has been gone over before but something always happens to sideline it. Well anywhoo… We need to order a couple of the iPod alarm clocks for the Sky Places. 323 didn’t have one for some reason so I had to take the one out of 320. Please let Raquel/Regino know that so they can put a temp. replacement clock in 320. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Party to Regino. Looks like they had tons of good food. mmmmm….\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 12th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB (some more)\r\n    The tub is hot and working, but the jets are out of order until we get a part from the mainland.\r\n\r\n    LILLY & MORGAN\r\n    Please don’t forget to release the room I’m holding for the people staying in the Speiden, in case they decide not to move.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2008 at 6:52 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Is out of order. Dave will try to repair it tomorrow and we’ll go from there. Please let our guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 11th, 2008 at 6:25 pm\r\n\r\n    CHA CHA CHA CHA CHANGES\r\n    I had to remake the current schedule. Everybody please look closely. Thank you all for your flexibility and your hard work.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 7:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino will be staying in 305 for the next 2 nights.\r\n\r\n    Cell phone was found. Stefan’s first night shift, yeah!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    CELL PHONE: Lilly used it yesterday when she was running errands for me. You might see if she still has it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 10th, 2008 at 7:26 am\r\n\r\n    Ruh-ro Shaggy\r\n\r\n    The front desk/overnight cell phone is missing. I put my number up on the door sign but I hope no one calls the call center… Anybody know where it is? I called it and didn’t get an answer. :(\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    September 9th, 2008 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning,\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY REGINO…:):):):):)\r\n    Elevator is fix :)\r\n    Sauna I am not sure, I will ask Seth today..\r\n    I am SO sad I missed the party on Saturday night, it sounds like you all had a blast.\r\n    Keep up the good work, and let’s fill those rooms up in September..\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    September 7th, 2008 at 1:08 pm\r\n\r\n    I thinks it been quite a long time since anyone of you heard from me. Well I’m back after a Great long night of dancing, up at the grange hall. Mexican dancing, couldn’t have imagined it being anymore fun. GO RAQUEL AND ELENA! They sure can boogie! Morgan too!\r\n    I know the season part is almost over, but the people are still vacationing like crazy. Sold out last night, and I am sure that it will be the same for next weekend.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    Relatively slow night.\r\n\r\n    Morgan- there is a big box on the back desk, could you call for a UPS pickup, please?\r\n\r\n    That is about it. See you next weekend :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 6th, 2008 at 7:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Khaili is selling our last room for the night as we speak. Good night so far, couple of glitches, nothing Khaili and I couldn’t fix, but happy guests and all is good.\r\n    New schedule is up.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 5th, 2008 at 3:56 pm\r\n\r\n    PUPPY DOGS\r\n    Going through upcoming reservations I notice that the pet fee is almost never added and nobody writes down the pet names. Just a reminder: pets cost $15 per night per pet. Please ask the guest for the pet name. Then, when checking in the guest, write the pet name on the pet policies.\r\n\r\n    BIKE 19 & 6\r\n    Gio (thanks for picking up the map paper today:) & Stefan, please bring those bikes to the repair shop tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    REGINO\r\n    Please make a complimentary reservation for Regino’s night shifts rather than blocking out a room. This way we won’t forget to clean the room and we can keep track of Regino’s nights spent here.\r\n\r\n    DIANA & OLESEA\r\n    Will have “saying good bye” drinks at the Peppermill tomorrow evening. Uaahhh, all those good byes make my tiny heart heavy.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 4th, 2008 at 6:12 pm\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON\r\n    Lilly called adventure providers & restaurants and got their changes in opening hours now in the shoulder season. The sheet is in the back desk basket. Thank you, Lilly! We’ll bring a copy of that down to BR as well.\r\n\r\n    Any updates on the elevator or the sauna, Cindy?\r\n\r\n    We’ll have a nice busy weekend ahead, thank you, sun! Let’s enjoy those last couple of weekends where we are fully staffed. Give that customer service as if it were going out of style, yeah!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2008 at 10:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I ended up not having time to start doing the Microsoft check-in stuff for tomorrow….sorry! The phones just won’t quit…see you tomorrow at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 3rd, 2008 at 6:05 pm\r\n\r\n    SAUNA\r\n    is not warming up. The cover plate to the control panel is missing, the control panel seems to be functioning normally, but the stove is totally cold. I let Seth know, he’ll look at it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS\r\n    Wow, we played “where are my bags” with 4 rooms. In the end all was good, but we need to pay more attention when putting bags into the rooms and/or switching rooms at the last minute.\r\n\r\n    MICROSOFT\r\n    Please prepare remote check-in (rooming list on back desk) and call Regino to go get them around 12.30 tomorrow.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2008 at 10:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is in room 321 for 4 nights….just wanting to let you all know.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 2nd, 2008 at 12:47 pm\r\n\r\n    So…I have a little bit of a dilemma. My mom told me that my little brothers football game was on Saturday…but it turns out that it is on Friday at 7pm, and I have to work the night shift. Would anyone be willing to switch shifts with me, or even just work a few hours from like 7-9?? I would really, really appreciate it!! This is really important to me, and probably the last time I will ever get to see my brother play football :( ….so if anyone can work for me please let me know!! Thanks you guys…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a little bit more info before I go.\r\n\r\n    - The clock radio on the back desk needs to go into 311. it is missing it’s patch cable so guests can’t hook up their ipods to it. You can get new cables at Radio Shack.\r\n\r\n    - My friends Adam and Aaron may come by to get the keys to my apartment. They are a hanging on the wall in the back office. it’s ok to give them to the guys. Please just make sure they give them back. I like keeping an extra set here. ;)\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all!\r\n\r\n    POOL STUFF\r\n\r\n    - This is just some general information about pool care while I’m gone. I will be back on Thursday afternoon so really the only thing you will need to worry about is the Jacuzzi. Sadly we ran out of chlorine granules over the weekend. Bather load was so high that I had to use more than usual to keep the water clean. I have already called Gerard and he is going to try and get a bucket or two over here as soon as he can. If he can’t find anyone to drop it off here earlier, he’ll bring it with the normal shipment on Thursday. I went a bought a small container of chlorine to get us by. It’s a gray container with a red cap. It’ll be on the shelf inside the chem room. I have told Steffi what to do as far as chemicals go but I need everyone to be on the lookout for the water level in the Jacuzzi. It needs to be kept a couple of inches over the intake on the side. There is a hose just inside the chem room door you can use to fill it.\r\n\r\n    We should be fine. I need to do the regular water change in the Jacuzzi when I get back anyway. Call if you have questions. I should have service until Tuesday afternoon and then again starting late-morning on Thursday.\r\n\r\n    Peace out! :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    September 1st, 2008 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    So Post San Juan was closed today and so was Printonyx….so I will do those errands tomorrow first thing when I get here!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodbye Diana, Emilia, and Marina! It was a great party. Thank you Lina for having a Birthday.\r\n\r\n    - Not much to report for tonight. A lot of people want late check-outs. It’s funny. Never before this year have I had so many people who assume they get the room for 24hrs. Odd. I’ve never been anywhere like that. (Except Vegas with their $25 6pm check-outs deals)\r\n\r\n    - Rooms 341 and 342 may want to move to a ground floor room tomorrow.They will talk about it and come by in the morning to see what is available if the decide to move.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    Can you please bring the nightgown to Post San Juan and pick up map paper at Printonyx on Tuesday when you get here? Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2008 at 6:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Well done, team! Great Labor Day weekend. Great party, Lina. Good bye and thanks for all your hard work Emilia, Marina & Diana. Have a great life and write us!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    I spoke with the guest and she left happy. Wrote maintenance request to check on those heaters.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Please always take down the name of the person you make a reservation with, see BR blog.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    When making a Clipper reservation or double checking one, please make sure to always suppress the pricing.\r\n\r\n    RATE SHEETS & FALL SPECIAL\r\n    I updated the rate sheets as per Adam. Please let our guests know about our fall special: $20 off the rack rate in October.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 30th, 2008 at 7:17 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all. *yawn*\r\n\r\n    Just to give you a heads up. The lady in 312 might not be too happy when she checks out. She called me 3 times over the course of the night convinced that the room next door was bouncing ping pong balls off the wall. I went by at 2:00, nothing. I went by at 3ish, nothing, finally when she calls at 4am I hang out in the room for a bit. It was the baseboard heater coils/plate expanding and contracting. (glad I didn’t knock on 314’s door and ask them to stop :D ) We’ve never received a complaint about it before but try to make her happy. Right now she just as sleep deprived as I am. :) Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2008 at 9:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Map Paper\r\n    We have a small amount of map paper ready at Printonyx. I think they open at 10 on Saturday so perhaps someone can run up and grab it. It goes on account so we shouldn’t be charged for it. They will be printing out more for us by Tuesday. This amount should be able to tide us over until then. Hopefully. :)\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    August 29th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    bike number 10purple has a low back tire. needs air. kj\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 1:09 pm\r\n\r\n    And I put the percentage symbol in the wrong place…\r\n    wow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 8:33 am\r\n\r\n    And by the way… I don’t know why I made my name khailiradden. I noticed that after I posted it, and then laughed at myself.\r\n    haha\r\n    khailiradden Says:\r\n    August 28th, 2008 at 8:31 am\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder that we changed the discounted items in the gift shop from %30 to %40.\r\n    Okay, that’s all for now :)\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    August 27th, 2008 at 3:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n\r\n    There are 3 cartons of half and half in the luggage room fridge. So Khaili can take them to Cafe Zia in the morning. OK that is all.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 10:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is in room 329…I blocked it out for the next three night, just fyi!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 9:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow…busy night. I had about four or five walk-ins…everyone is trying to get out of the rain!\r\n\r\n    So the pool…unfortunately I didn’t catch the guys name or room number (a hectic moment in the lobby) but hopefully he will be stopping by in the morning….his son cut his foot when he was getting into the pool on some kind of metal or something. He said his son is ok but the cut bled pretty good for a while…he was pretty disappointed. Morgan went and checked it out and felt all around the stairs into the pool where the guest said his son cut his foot, but he didn’t find anything. So….if he comes in and mentions this, please get some specific information from him about where exactly in the pool he thinks his son cut his foot. Bummer :(\r\n\r\n    Other than that, not too much to report…pretty steady and busy from about 6:30 until about 8…whew. I guess the rain doesn’t always keep the tourists away…see you all tomorrow!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 26th, 2008 at 11:57 am\r\n\r\n    Hey-O!\r\n\r\n    - We now have 2 new locks for the bike rack. They are nifty “weather-sealed” locks so hopefully they will last a bit longer than the last. The front desk has a key, the cafe has a key, and we have a spare in Cindy’s cash bag. There is also a spare lock in the cupboard above the loo in the bathroom. That’s right! Three locks that all work on the same key! Exciting, right!? (I think I need to get out more.)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 25th, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    - Remind me tomorrow to go to Ace and buy new locks for the bike racks. The second one is starting to fail now too. So much for “xtra tough” Masterlocks.\r\n\r\n    - Ordered Coffee for the back.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 10:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Not too much to much to report.\r\n    The folks in 103 moved to 203. They were complaining of the noise in the room next to them. Please tell housekeeping in the morning that the room needs to be cleaned. Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Khaili, when you come to work tomorrow, can you please DRIVE (oh yeah!!!) to Post San Juan and have one of our guest’s luggage shipped back to him. Form on back desk, luggage in luggage room.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up. Please look closely, some shifts have changed. Thank you all for being so flexible.\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    Please don’t forget to add 15% to the room service tab when adding the charges to a guest room.\r\n\r\n    RAZORS\r\n    If a guest needs a razor, we now have disposable ones for sale for $1 per razor. They are in our bathroom.\r\n\r\n    Great weekend everybody. An extra special THANKS to our housekeepers, who worked so hard and then some.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 24th, 2008 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi has an EXCELLENT point about customer service. Remember that the guests who are coming here at the end of August deserve every much the same ounce of outstanding customer service as those coming in the beginning of June. I know, I know, easy for me to say since I haven’t been around much this summer, but it’s really true. You owe it to them and to yourselves. Remember how good it feels when you know that you are giving your best!\r\n\r\n    Thank you, thank you, thank you all for being troopers in the midst of chaos and frenzy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2008 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much to report. We need to cut off the lock on the bike rack closest to the office. There are a pair of bolt cutters in the maintenance room. I think we have a spare lock and key around here somewhere we can use.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 23rd, 2008 at 5:55 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW CAB IN TOWN – 298-4434\r\n    Friday Harbor Taxi is a new cab company in town. They also own the Dragonfly Inn, are really nice and have lower prices. Business cards are in drawer with stamps.\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Morgan ordered new map paper. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    LOG OUT\r\n    Please don’t forget to log out of WRP when you leave your work station, so things are not done in your name against your will.\r\n\r\n    Happy end of August, everybody. Remember our guests visiting now deserve the same smile, recommendations, service and kindness as the ones who visited us in June. Much love:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 11:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Whoo. Relativly slow night except for a crazy moment that ran between 9:15 and ~10:15. Sheesh. Phones ringing, room service calls, ferry unloading, Frontline calling MY cell phone, phones ringing more WHEEEEEEEEEEEE.\r\n\r\n    Congrats to Khaili for passing her driving exam.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday Lina :)\r\n    Have a great birthday…\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 22nd, 2008 at 8:22 am\r\n\r\n    Thanks Lilly for leaving the info on why the emergency room was release. VERY helpful:)\r\n    GIO\r\n    WOW you are amazing, well done on your baking…\r\n    Welcome back Adam and Laura\r\n    Happy early birthday Ms. Khaili, what was it your Dad was saying this morning???(smile) What a wonderful gift you have been to me, I am SO blessed.. Love ya bunches XOXOXOX\r\n    Have a great weekend everyone,\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 21st, 2008 at 10:24 pm\r\n\r\n    #1281211…had to release emergency hold room for 8/22, please read guest remarks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2008 at 5:29 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO & CAFE ZIA\r\n    Our Gio needs to see a doctor tomorrow. If she feels well enough, she will come and open cafe zia, then see the doctor around 8.30, if not we’ll play it by ear. We send you love and strength, Gio, and hope you feel better soon.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL & 310\r\n    Can you please let Raquel know that I took the luggage rack out of 310. I needed one and couldn’t find an extra.\r\n\r\n    REGINO & Backroads\r\n    Please remind Regino that he needs to load Backroads’ van around 11 AM tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 20th, 2008 at 11:45 am\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    So, the guests in the hideaway checked out a day early. He came in this morning and was happy with the room, he just was unhappy that we advertised that it was pet friendly and then didn’t allow him to bring his dog in last night. I think that what happened is we had him sign the invoice and out of habit, had him initial that he wouldn’t have a pet. He was supposed to stay for two nights but decided to check out a day early even though I told him that he COULD have his pet in the room. He didn’t seem to he too upset, just ready to go home. ANYWAYS… moral of the story is to remember that the Hideaway is pet friendly :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Quiet night. Not too much to report.\r\n\r\n    - Some more slightly disappointed people checking in to the Hideaway. Another online booking rears it’s ugly head. I don’t think they’ll want to move but they weren’t too happy about it being down the street. I guess that whole thing about it being, “a block from ELEMENTS…” needs to be in bold.\r\n\r\n    - Regino is in 218 for his nights. First time in a while he hasn’t had to sleep in the Conference room. :)\r\n\r\n    Wet and windy night. Almost feels like winter….\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 3:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Cindy- You are not supposed to tell anyone about my drive.. that way, if I fail I won’t have to admit it :)\r\n    There is a piece of luggage in the back that are labeled 216. They will be back tomorrow morning to get that.\r\n\r\n    See you in the morning!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 1:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Tuesday everyone, watch out 4 more days until Khaili drives, get off the road JK,, she is a great driver..:)\r\n    CUPS\r\n    Please don’t put the water cups out for the hot water cups, they will not work…\r\n    Gerard will be dropping more hot cups off today\r\n    Coffee center\r\n    Please make sure that the coffee center is always full of items, we never want it to look empty\r\n    Flowers\r\n    This is a pet peeve I hate seeing dead flowers in the lobby, please remove them, no flowers are better then dead ones.\r\n    Lots of complaints from the weekend regarding having no air conditioning during our heat wave, I cannot stress this enough, please please please tell every guest making reservation during a possible warm time that we only have air conditioning in some rooms,, most people expect A/C and it is up to us to tell them the specifics so please do so.\r\n    Reservations\r\n    I have noticed that not all reservations have all the information in it, like address or phone number or 3 digit security code, it is important to gather all information that the form asks.\r\n    Trip Advisor\r\n    Great job on all the great reviews, remember we will tally the results at the end of the month, and pay out at that time. Way to go everyone..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 19th, 2008 at 1:59 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all.\r\n\r\n    Nothing to crazy to report. The weather had a lot of people coming and going from the office to escape from the random rain.\r\n    - Bike #5 need to be taken over to Paul’s. I didn’t get a good look at it but the rear wheel is not turning freely. I put behind the office by my porch.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it really. Everything else was just the usual craziness. :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2008 at 1:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, what a fair weekend.. Did you all get enough Fair to last you another year? I was lucky enough (JK) to see one of the rides (the ZIPPER) have one of the cages fall half off of the track while someone was in it. That was freaky, and of course I stood at the bottom of the ride while I made sure none of my ride going kids were on that crazy ride.\r\n    DELL\r\n    I ordered 2 more cartridges for the drum and I ordered some more ink. We should have plenty for now, BUT when you use the last one on the shelf PLEASE tell me so I can order some more.\r\n    What is up with the lighting and thunder, I kinda feel like I am back in Hawaii:) What a nice thought…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 18th, 2008 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    I ordered four cases of 8oz cups(as per Cindy) so we won’t run out for a while HOWEVER, when we start running low we need to reorder them ASAP.\r\n    Thats all for now.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey all just some slight random FYI’s\r\n\r\n    - Please make sure housekeeping changes the sheets in 322. Apparently they’re “nubby” and the guests don’t like them. Not really sure what’s going on but they would like fresh sheets. Thanks.\r\n\r\n    - Just a reminder that 114 has a 1pm check-out per Steffi. It should be on the housekeeping report…\r\n\r\n    - We are out of the little 8oz paper cups we use in the lobby. Gerard says that he always keeps them in stock so if someone could please call him in the morning to see if he can bring a box or two over when he comes to take our regular orders on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n    - Coffee has been ordered from SJCRC. They should bring it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    - Someone need to go the grocery store to get some sugar. We are out.\r\n\r\n    - The front desk’s copy of the bike lock key has gone missing. Gio said that we had it Sunday morning but it disappeared by the time I got to work. Perhaps someone accidentally has it in a back pocket? Keep your eyes out for it. We are currently stealing Gio’s cafe copy.\r\n\r\n    I think that’s about it… whew.. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Front Desk Printer\r\n\r\n    The generic brand drum replacement Gerard brought us suddenly died tonight. We put map paper in the back printer so print to Steffi’s desk. I think wee need to order an official drum replacement directly from Dell. The generic brand one worked for a time, even though the “replace drum” light still blinked while we were using it. Must just not be compatible enough… ah well. Hopefully Cindy can order a new one first thing in the morning and we can get it in a day to so.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 17th, 2008 at 8:30 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN….room 321 is leaving for a kayaking trip and will be returning on Friday, can you please go grab their 4 bags (they are leaving the bags in their room because they are leaving before 8) and store them in the luggage room? Thank you!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 16th, 2008 at 6:04 pm\r\n\r\n    112\r\n    I o.k.ed a 1 PM check out for those guys tomorrow, see WRP notes. Please let HK know:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    Hoookay….\r\n\r\n    Lot’s of room canceling, moving and booking excitement tonight.\r\n\r\n    - We no longer have a hold room for Saturday. A guest called us and told us he *just* noticed that he booked the reservation for the wrong date. It was booked for tonight but he meant it to be for Saturday. We had to give him our last Emergency hold room for Sat. Thankfully we were able to sell his room for tonight. He is trying to blame us for booking the wrong date even though he did it online. (Go figure) So what this boils down to is that if you get any cancellations for Saturday you might just want to hold on to it. Just in case.\r\n\r\n    - The guest in 337 is a very nice old woman and VERY hard of hearing. She’s here for 10 days and so far we’ve had to tell twice to turn down the TV. :) I wonder if we can find some headphones for her…\r\n\r\n    - The Sea Port folks are going to want us to take their luggage down to the marina in the morning. They will probably elect a person to go with the luggage. They should be coming by around 11am, perhaps a little after.\r\n\r\n    Well That’s it. I’m OUTTA HERE!!!!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 4:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    We had several incidents (one just today) where guests booked massage treatments right after they think they arrive with the ferry, but then they miss the ferry or the ferry is late and everything goes haywire. So just to reiterate: please let our guests know how full the ferries are this time of the year, make sure they know that the spa will charge them for a missed appointment, encourage guests to play it safe, have their treatment the morning after they arrive.\r\n    Also: Ceily complained that some adventure providers pick up our guests right by the spa and having their big trucks idle right there under the spa windows. If you see that, please go out there and ask the adventure provider or cab driver politely to pull in by the lobby or wait for our guests a little away from the spa.\r\n    Gracias!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 15th, 2008 at 2:18 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a reservation in the new bookings section from UNIREZ that is not to be confirmed, it has a invalid credit card and we are waiting for them to call back with a new one until we do confirm it.\r\n    It is friday! ONE more week until I get my license.. and become the official Jacob, Dylan and Friends chauffeur. haha :D\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend. See you on Monday.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Rez # 1260611\r\n    Will be moving to room 302 tomorrow and will want their luggage moved over.\r\n\r\n    Guest asked me to scan and e-mail some pages for him but I couldn’t get the scanner to do it so I just made him some copies maybe someone can try again in the morning.\r\n\r\n    that about it not a whole lot going on tonight\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey I just remembered something. When you click on “more photos” in the Wind Place department nothing happens. I had a guest comment on it when I was up at E last weekend.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Yes.. I did pass my written. :)\r\n    Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n    Not too much to talk about. Elena has her blogging list going so we combined lists.\r\n    See you in the morning! I’m off to the fair.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 13th, 2008 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Hot Chocolate\r\n    The extra is kept in the Orca Storage room, Stefan has refilled the coffee service area for now.\r\n    Pepsi Machine by Pool\r\n    Pepsi will be here on Tuesday to fix and fill the machine\r\n    Bikes are fixed and back on the property, please remember to bring them directly over to the bike shop when they are not working\r\n    Khaili\r\n    YAHHHHH, Khaili passed her written, one more step to go and then I will have a VERY responsible chauffeur :) JK (kinda)\r\n    Well done Ms. Khaili\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    Starting September 2, Cafe Zia will be closed Monday thru Thursday. Natailya will be in the coffee shop Friday, Saturday and Sunday and will be helping Raquel in HSK 2 days a week.\r\n    Keep up the GREAT work everyone, we are at the tail end of Summer..\r\n    Smile,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2008 at 11:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    Released our emergency room around 6:00, not sold.\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    Maya’s called us back late tonight and said that he’s sorry but all sold out for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    POST\r\n    Tori called in tonight to change the address on the package on the back desk. I filled out a Post form for it, so it’s all ready to go.\r\n\r\n    TEA AREA\r\n    Does anyone know where there is some hot chocolate?? Morgan said there were two boxes ordered but we don’t know where they went. I filled the spot with extra apple cider and then borrowed some instant coffees from the housekeeping room.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2008 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing exciting.\r\n    Just getting my blogging fix of the day.\r\n    Okay, good night :D\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    USEFUL INFORMATION\r\n    Found out today that Bob’s Taxi isn’t officially open until 6:00 am. They will do rides before by arrangement, but they said there is an added $15.00 fee.\r\n\r\n    301\r\n    The wall sconce light bulb is out. I wrote it up in a maintenance request form, but maybe Regino could replace it before the next guest checks in.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Bike numbers’ 4 & 17 tires are flat. They need new tubes. I will try to get them over to Paul’s in the morning.\r\n\r\n    The computer in the lobby is having a problem staying connected. I had to reconnect it to the lobby network several times tonight. I finally put the computer up on the table to try and get a better signal. So far so good but remember to tell Chris about it tomorrow. He might know a better way.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it I guess. See you all bright and early.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Open Rooms\r\n\r\n    Well we’ve just had a rash of cancellations and room moveings so we now have several rooms open for Wednesday and Thursday this week. I have informed the FHH and they will try to send people this way. BR has been told too. This week’s going to be a crazy one. w00t!! Fair time!!\r\n\r\n    Please keep in mind we have a couple of hold rooms on tap for every day this week. We are sold out for Friday and Saturday but we have 2 Emerg. Rooms held for each day. Lets sellout every day this week!!! Go Team! The Fighting ELEMENTONIANS.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 11th, 2008 at 3:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing this morning. Except this really weird 911 call. It said that rm 803 made the call according to the phone console. BUT when the cop came by, he said that the 4351 number(fax) had been calling them consistently. So weird. Anyways, nothing was wrong, everyone was fine. Just very weird.\r\n\r\n    Alrighty.. well, I am off for the day. See you tomorrow :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 10:56 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much to say tonight. Left a couple of alarms.\r\n\r\n    - Just to let you know that we now have 2 rooms open for tomorrow. Reservations #1141644 and #1141673 needed to leave a day early. While I am certain we’ll sell the room I did not want to credit them for the night until we do. So please if you sell any one of the two rooms, please credit their accounts. Thanks!!\r\n\r\n    - Also remember we have 308 on emergency hold.\r\n\r\n    - We haven’t heard back from Jessica the Hideaway housekeeper. Therefore our blanket is still missing in action. Please try to give her another call in the morning.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! See you all at 1!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    will not be in the office on Monday. Please call her at home or on her cell if you guys need something (”I’m hungry, are we there yet?”)\r\n\r\n    SEA & SKY\r\n    We had several missed sea & sky packages this weekend, scramble scramble, all kayak tours sold out, FHH & STEPS having private parties, Back Door Kitchen completely sold out, scramble, scramble…\r\n    Please, guys, when you have a little down time (that is: before you check your personal email), double check upcoming reservations. Do it for the sanity of your coworkers.\r\n\r\n    BL (BEAUTIFUL LAURA)\r\n    Supplied us with half a metric ton of organic fair trade chocolate today. Yeah! It’s nestled in the Fresh Mouth Emporium. Thank you!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    August 10th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    LOST BRACELET!!\r\n    Found in the Van Today! It’s put away in E envelope in the Drawer in the back desk that is below The one that says Steffi! I have put my dibs on it if there is no claim :D !!\r\n    It went very smoothly! I am near my way out to my weekend! I will see all you in a few days!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin All!\r\n    Lots of folks doing laundry tonight after the designated hours. I think we may need to remake/add more signs in the laundry room so we can keep our folks in 332 as happy as possible.\r\n\r\n    - The folks in the Hideaway came up late looking for another blanket. I gave them a grayish, cream colored fleece blanket from housekeeping. Please make sure you call Jessica in the morning so we can make sure to get it back. One of us may just need to walk down there in the morning to collect it.\r\n\r\n    -Also there is a box in the back of gifts that need to go into room #326 tomorrow before they check in.\r\n\r\n    -Tory!(my favorite guy to work with) just kidding Morgan hadn’t sent this and so I thought I would be silly. No but anyway I just did a ton of pretty vouchers and straightened the basket out. Please try to keep it this way I was inspired when I had to do a last minute voucher and everything was in a big knot of vouchers, covers, envelopes, ribbon and wax sticky things but all mixed up. Bye E see you next week. Goin on my well needed days of for some R&R. I really should have just put this under Tory Says: but I thought I’d be cute for once.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 9th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing today so far. It is such a pleasure working with my extremely competent and sweet coworkers.\r\n\r\n    MONDAY\r\n    I brought 2 espresso machines up from BR, please give them to the UPS guy on Monday. There is also a small package for Post San Juan on my desk. Please take care of that as well.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2008 at 10:22 pm\r\n\r\n    What a warm welcome from my distant relatives up here at E. hugs and all. Screams from the balconies in all different languages. A man was actually yelling for his son named Cory and I was so caught up in my popularity that I thought it was someone calling for me. Some faces I haven’t seen in months. It’s good to be back. Nice night with Morgan and Steffi. But I do miss my girls at B.R.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 8th, 2008 at 12:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Bottle openers are in! I put them in the drawer.\r\n\r\n    The “no show” from last night was actually supposed to be a canceled reservation. They had two separate reservations and they were both supposed to be canceled but the second one didn’t. That being said we have a sky place open for tonight and tomorrow night.\r\n\r\n    I called the housekeepers and they didn’t know anythings about the watch. They said that they would call back in a few.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 10:40 pm\r\n\r\n    REZ # 1246647 thinks that they may have left their Fossil watch with blue face in the room when they checked out please ask housekeeping and call them back.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, I’m back!\r\n    Sounds like you all had a rather eventful week. Way to go, my resourceful ELEMENTONIONS!\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Has a spanking new water heater.\r\n\r\n    WINE BOTTLE OPENERS\r\n    are ordered\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    I’ll make a new schedule this weekend (Saturday). Let me know about day-off wishes and such. Also: Please let me know when you are going back to school (Khaili & Elena) or leaving us (sniff).\r\n\r\n    TO-DO\r\n    Please double check adventure & massage voucher invoices (in my box).\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 12:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday:)\r\n    Well done yesterday team…\r\n    Welcome back Steffi..\r\n    It was a rough start this morning, BUT things are up and going as normal as can be…\r\n    Back office/Steffi’s desk\r\n    The desk in Steffi’s office HAS to be cleaned off at ALL times, the paper cutter can stay there but nothing else. Please look to your left when you are walking through the door way in there, Tuesday I found packages of things that had been delivered to the hotel via UPS and no one bothered to see where they went they just stacked them up. If you are not sure ask me, usually I know what’s been ordered.\r\n    It is almost SJC Fair time..\r\n    Have fun,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 7th, 2008 at 8:05 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n\r\n    I’m back. And rested.\r\n\r\n    Printer is good. There was a cord in the way of the tray (that rhymes) but it is ready to rock now.\r\n\r\n    That is all for now. For some reason I felt the urge to write a blog about ‘fixing’ the printer…\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2008 at 10:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Well as Khaili said it was INSANE no other way to put it, just everything that could go wrong, did. The only good thing that happened was the internet kicking back on at around 8:30, oh and having Khaili around to help wasn’t bad either J/K.\r\n    ZZ ZZZ ZZ\r\n    Just a few things to pass on for now…\r\n    ZZZ ZZ\r\n    Room Service…\r\n    What do we do with the signed slip? I had one tonight, which for now is in cash drawer 1.\r\n    ZZ ZZZ\r\n    Invoices…\r\n    Although we did have that small printer at the guest desk it just wasn’t fast enough to handle the number of copies we needed so there may be several people asking for invoices tomorrow.\r\n    ZZZZ\r\n    Printer…\r\n    The front desk printer paper tray is not wanting to close all the way I kept fiddling with it but couldn’t get anywhere with it maybe in the morning someone can figure it out?\r\n    ZZZ ZZZZZ\r\n    That is all I can remember for now. I’m sure I’ve forgotten something but my brain is off for the night.\r\n\r\n    I’m off to catch some ZZZZZ’s\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 6th, 2008 at 9:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Great news: I got my car today! And the internet is up. I will NEVER in my life again take the internet for granted.\r\n\r\n    Other news:\r\n\r\n    Well, basically is was insane. No other way to put it. I’m not going into details, but I’m ready for a great nights sleep. Not anything to pass on. I don’t think that I am making sense….\r\n\r\n    Good night.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey All\r\n\r\n    Firstly, we need more pens in the office. there like gold in here and our supply is low.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, a booking happened again for the wrong dates. However this time we were completely sold out and so was every SINGLE other place on the ENTIRE island. Anyways after many many many phone calls, we reached an agreement that they would be in the Orca room w/o a shower. But as we were arranging that BW called and under their owners permission opened a room up that was under maintenence. So i guess all’s well that ends well. :) Let this also be a reminder to us that we absolutely NEED to have emergency rooms on hold!\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow im off to beat ferry traffic and enjoy the sun on Orca’s island. See you soon!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    TechieChris Says:\r\n    August 5th, 2008 at 5:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everybody! TechieChris here – Just wanted to let everyone know that I made the Guest Computer at Elements able to print to the Brother Printer next to Steffi’s desk. Also, the server (the computer in the back corner of the front desk) will also print, but to the Dell printer at the front counter.\r\n\r\n    I am trying to find out where the weak spots are for the WiFi – any time someone complains about it working poorly or not at all, please note their room! Very important for me to know where the bad spots are.\r\n\r\n    One more thing – the Lobby Wireless has a new password ’sunshine’ just like the property-wide.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day!\r\n\r\n    Chris\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    August 4th, 2008 at 10:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    Lots of stuff going on.\r\n\r\n    MORNING SHIFT\r\n\r\n    -theres an envelope in the back with information on a group folio that i tried to book. it was for a man and his family, to get the payment on one bill i tried to folio it. Please check it out #11330. I have the credit card info inside the envelope. Im not sure if it was saved in the folio or not. Please double check it for me and then give the man a call back on his local # before 10:00.\r\n\r\n    -Western Prince should call back about books for a party of 8 #1251307. Please confirm with them if they do.\r\n\r\n    -guests in 203 are very upset about the wi-fi having a low signal in there room. Cindy knows about it, they will most likely be in this morning trying to talk to her. we left a message with Chris.\r\n\r\n    -room 202 had no remote. i gave them a remote to try and set. when i went up to the room shortly after no one answered when i knocked. they are a stay over so lets try and get this taken care off.\r\n\r\n    -there are two phone messages that need to be returned, after taking care of wine openers, pool towels, tvs, bikes, by the time i got back in the office (a half hour later) there were three messages. it was 10:00 by then and didn’t want to disrupt them.\r\n\r\n    OTHER STUFF\r\n\r\n    -the phone on the back desk was in room 203. It was broken and would not ring. Raquel switched it out with another phone.\r\n\r\n    -there are also two items that need to be brought up to post san juan. i believe we need more information on the white bag.\r\n\r\n    -where did all of our wine openers go???? at one point we had none, and then i found one in housekeeping and had 3 different people use it. this makes me think we should have people check them out, or simply only let them open wine in the front office with our wine openers. basically, we need more wine openers once again.\r\n\r\n    See you this afternoon.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2008 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Whooo…. Khaili wasn’t kidding. Phones were all over the place tonight.\r\n    - We are sold out for tomorrow. WooHoo! There is still one Emergency room. Let’s hope we can sell it an not use it for an emergency. :)\r\n    - We are in need of some more Spa/Dining vouchers. I will try to print some out tomorrow and we can try to whip some up.\r\n    - I ordered more hot cocoa on Saturday. It should hopefully get here tomorrow.\r\n    - The gift basket from SJO has now been almost completely ransacked. Poor thing never had a chance. *sniff* Those Sunday front desk girls are a force to be reckoned with. :D\r\n    - Our in room hair dryers (the kind that mount on the wall) have been dropping like flies this weekend. I had half a dozen calls today alone about people having problems with them. Either not working or the reset buttons repeatedly tripping. We may have to swap them out for more traditional style hair dryers.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. See you all in the mornin’\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 3rd, 2008 at 9:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Not much.. again.\r\n\r\n    Phones were crazy. That’s about it :) haha. My dad is rushing me.\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 11:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning everybody! I hope we’re all bright-eyed and bushy tailed.\r\n\r\n    - Yes please read the notes for #1215689. He wants to talk to Cindy directly and he know she won’t be here until Monday. I was holding room 114 for them in case they wanted to move but they never got back to me. Khaili left them messages but I guess they were out to dinner. If they come to you looking for a place to shower in the morning you can always offer them that room. Give them a late check out too if they want. Ugh. Sorry.\r\n\r\n    - Brian and the fine folks at San Juan Outfitters dropped off a lovely goodie basket for us all. Along with the fruit and chocolates there are also some Red Bull’s in the fridge. Have fun with those. I ain’t touchin’ ‘em. :)\r\n\r\n    - Due to the fact that we are filling up quite quickly for this entire week (YAY!), I have made a series of Emergency hold rooms for the upcoming days. You will find them on the Unit Maintenance section. We still have a few Water places most of the days but we are sold out of 2 queen rooms. I have put at least 1-2 Earth places on hold just in case. I will be sure to release them if everything is going well. So far we have used every hold room every weekend for mishaps and incorrect bookings. :( Not always our fault thankfully.\r\n\r\n    - Adam, is it possible to get some pictures of the Hideaway up on the reservation screen? I have noticed that near 60-70% of the time most folks we check in there are unhappy because they were expecting our decor style. We often have to use our emergency hold rooms to bring them here because they don’t like the room. We all try to describe the room to people over the phone when making reservations but a lot of reso’s come in as last minute online bookings. I know your out of town but perhaps when you get back, unwound, and caught up on the mound of other things I am sure you have to do? :) I think it’ll make our guest’s lives easier. Thanks so much.\r\n\r\n    That’s it. Call me if you have questions. You know me, I never sleep. :D\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 8:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all-\r\n    I haven’t written for a while.. I really need to start remembering.\r\n    So- a little bit of an incident tonight. I would recommend reading the remarks in reservation #1215689 for all the info.\r\n\r\n    Besides that, not much going on. We are sold out! Woohoo! August is filling up pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n    Okay, well I am about to head home.. to my lonely house.. :( Thank you, family (Cindy) for leaving me. Juust kidding.\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2008 at 8:02 am\r\n\r\n    Morning all. Nothing much to report for last night. The High Noon folks were getting faxes like they were going out of style. Just a reminder that we have to rooms on Emergency hold. Please try not to release them unless you really need to. We’ll take a look at things a little later in the afternoon and release them then if everything going alright. Please call me if you are having problems today. I’ll be in at 3. Let’s hope everything goes smoothly. (knock knock) Laterz!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 1st, 2008 at 5:24 pm\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow…8/2 Lavendera has a 10:30 massage available as well as a few reflexology appointments open. Please let anyone interested know!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    August 1st, 2008 at 2:11 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG: the computer upstairs is still not working. i called techi chris to see if he was able to stop by today. friday. left a message.\r\n\r\n    unable to send espresso machines today. aeronautical would not come to pick up. they said we needed to drop them off. their office hours are monday- friday 7-3pm. can someone with a car do this monday? or if they drop off anything…like a new computer….trade them.\r\n\r\n    thanks lilly for taking my shift monday. you are on the schedule officially.\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    I am the remote control queen!! Hehe…It took me about 3 separate tries and about 15 minutes of instruction reading and I got 112’s remote working…woohoo! I think we all could use a little tutorial on those things, they are not as easy as they seem! PS- there have been a lot of guests calling in lately saying their rooms either a) don’t have a remote, or b)their remote doesn’t work. Can we talk to Raquel or Regino and have them always have the housekeepers make sure there is a remote in the rooms and that it works?? It would save us non-techie people a lot of confusion!!\r\n\r\n    A pretty slow night…the rain is keeping everyone locked up in their rooms. The jazz was so cool tonight, the people were very talented…\r\n\r\n    We’ve had some late-night pool goers lately…how are people getting in after 10? It looks like the pool is empty and then they just appear out of nowhere…hmmmm.\r\n\r\n    Khai…please call housekeeping tomorrow morning and ask Raquel if they have found a Boston Red Sox hat in room 341 or 342 in the last few days. Thank you missy!\r\n\r\n    Hopefully the sun will come out tomorrow, I am crossing my fingers!! See you all at 1…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 31st, 2008 at 7:09 pm\r\n\r\n    BUSY, BUSY, BUSY\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    I went through upcoming reservation and made a whole bunch of alarms to follow through. None of them are super urgent, so don’t get a heart attack tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n    DAS ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    Morgan, please double check all EH rooming lists (in your box).\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS\r\n    Will be here again next Wednesday again, Regino will do the luggage handling on Wednesday at 3 and Thursday at 11:15 (Cindy: luggage fee not added yet).\r\n\r\n    JAZZ\r\n    Was very nice, a couple of guests sat on the couch and listened.\r\n\r\n    Hang in there, Sweeties, I will send you strength from the forest to get through the weekend:)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 10:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    FRONT DESK\r\n    Please tell housekeeping about the two lost item requests , they are next to the front desk phone with description and contact info.\r\n\r\n    LOCALS\r\n    Tonight i had the liberty of kicking two local smucks out of the pool house (ahem..Cody and Mariah round two). Khaili and i had scene them before but they came back again. The moment i spotted his car in the back parking lot i found them all cozy in OUR hottub. i went in and told them whats up. if them come back, which i dont think they will, lets call the cops!!\r\n\r\n    Other than that its been quite here in Element Land\r\n\r\n    ps. i am soooo excited my cell phone came!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 6:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BELOW BIRD ROCK BLOG\r\n    (it does that thing again where it says: Your comment is awaiting moderation and it’s not showing up, mhm)\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    FOOD FUTURE\r\n    Elena will order produce tomorrow, which we need to pick up on Friday. Kaitlyn or Tory, can one of you get a check from Cindy and head on up to MP for pick up, please? Buy some bananas and anything else we might need to get through the weekend.\r\n\r\n    Lilly will pick up the Food Coop order next Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    I’m in the woods. Please buy food as needed (there is some cash in the safe in an envelope with my name on it, write down what you take). Please contact Cindy if something big happens. Have a great week:)\r\n\r\n    # Steffi Says: Your comment is awaiting moderation.\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 1:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn & Lilly: you two switching shifts is totally fine with me. Thanks for letting me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 5:33 pm\r\n\r\n    BACKROADS DEPARTURE THURSDAY\r\n    Please tell Regino first thing in the morning that Backroads would like their luggage handled at 11:15 AM, all goes back in their van, except the luggage from room 104, that goes in the lobby (guest is leaving via Victoria Express).\r\n    Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 1:41 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER CREDIT CARD\r\n    The guest who left his credit card(on back desk by bike forms) was a clipper guest (therefore we don’t have contact info). Clipper will call guest, guest will call us, please get address so we can send his card back.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 11:31 am\r\n\r\n    Well done everyone:) I am so PROUD of the Trip Advisor review we received. BRAVO…\r\n    Gio\r\n    Please take it easy, we will all as a team help you through the next 4 weeks, please call me up front if you need any help with luggage or anything else.\r\n    Phone system\r\n    We are getting there, the night forwarding is working but the day forwarding is not, (or I should say it is sporadic) so please get every phone call you can by the 4th ring.\r\n    Evening Magazine\r\n    Thanks everyone for all your effort in making sure this event went smoothly. I really appreciate all you did. The show will air tonight at 7pm on channel 5, I think Priscilla may be on air..\r\n    Steffi\r\n    Steffi will be gone this weekend, YAHHHH off to the woods and a well deserved break from the craziness. Enjoy yourself. If you need anything call Morgan and then me.\r\n    MUSIC by the Pool\r\n    Enjoy yourself tomorrow night from 5:30 to 7:30 PM, we will have live music at the pool patio. Open to the public, tell all your friends.\r\n    Phone Charges\r\n    The phone charges are still not fixed, when a guest in house calls “0″ after hours and it gets transfered to Frontline. Please delete those charges when you see them.\r\n    Thanks again for all your wonderful help.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 10:12 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning everybody! So if anybody wonders what these green bags are doing in the back office some guests that went on a kayaking trip left them here for SJO to pick up. And also Chris came yesterday and fixed the lobby wireless. So no more problems. And he also changed the password to “sunshine” so now both the Elements Wi-Fi and the Elements lobby have the same one. Thats it for now.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 30th, 2008 at 9:42 am\r\n\r\n    For all you Hazelnut coffee drinkers…..I have called island paper, and put in an order for the Classic Hazelnut syrup, and sending the ” New and Improved”, BACK!! It should be here on friday! YEAH!! Also, we have here a Credit card with a bike release for that looks like its been here for a couple of days. Does anyone know what this is??\r\n    I HAVE A INJURY :( :(\r\n    Yesterday morning I woke up and felt GREAT, then about an hour later, I had a shooting pain in the middle of my neck. Shortly after that i noticed that I was loosing my vision in my right eye!! (SCARY)A few seconds after that I had lost about 80% of my vision out of my right eye. So I called my uncle doc. in a panic. He told me that it sounded like I was getting a visual migraine. I ended up spending all day at the doctors and the optimoligist. They want me to take it easy for 6 weeks. No lifting over 20 lbs. I have to go in 4 weeks from now. They are running a few tests. Might have a detaching retina (spelling??)WHAAHHH i am freaked out! So Luggage, I will need help. Sorry, I will do the best I can.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 10:59 pm\r\n\r\n    All check ins here tonight.\r\n\r\n    SOLD OUT for this Saturday night. YAY!\r\n\r\n    ONE PROBLEM\r\n    Unirez booked a room that is unavailable for this saturday night. I wasn’t sure how to deal with this so i left it for you morgan.\r\n\r\n    Ill be here to cover your shift at 10:30 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Im off to go fix a tv and go home to bed.\r\n\r\n    xo\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    lilly: do you want to take my shift on monday the 4th at bird rock? 3-11? i could go for a day off…. let me know via bird rock log. thanks (we need to clear it with steffi too.)\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 28th, 2008 at 7:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool Info\r\n\r\n    I forgot to mention earlier that when I went to do the pool this morning that the breaker on the pool heater was popped and need to be reset. From the look of the temp in the pool the heater hadn’t been working for at least 2 days. I have reset the breaker but it will take a bit for the temp to get back up. I’ll keep you posted if anything else is happening. Temp was at ~70 this morning so it’ll take a day or so to get it back to the normal 80.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Ugh….so the line that comes in from rooms trying to call the front desk is forwarding to front line after like two rings….is this supposed to happen?\r\n\r\n    Anyway, so if anyone needs a day off or needs anyone to cover a shift next week, I am looking for hours on Monday and Tuesday the 4th and 5th and I would be more than happy to pick up anyone’s shift…just let me know!\r\n\r\n    Also…we are way low on coffee cups, so I stole a few from Cafe Zia, sorry Gio and Nataliya! Raquel said that she ordered some for us, but we don’t know when they are coming. In the meantime, can someone run down to Kings and grab a pack of 8oz cups, we only have a few left and I’m sure they will be gone soon!\r\n\r\n    Anyway, have a good Monday everyone, see you on Tuesday!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder…don’t forget to ALWAYS suppress pricing on clipper reservations. Thanks guys!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 27th, 2008 at 1:53 pm\r\n\r\n    You guys are so sweet.\r\n\r\n    PHONE CHARGES\r\n    When guests call the operator and nobody picks up, the system routes them to the call center and then charges them for the call (it’s always the same 801 number). Please delete those charges. Phone Bob will be back tomorrow and fix that (I talked to him).\r\n\r\n    340\r\n    needs cleaning, moved guest to a different room, please make sure HK knows\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY\r\n    We’ll have a Backroads group arriving on Wednesday. Please make a rooming list, prepare a remote check in and make keys for that group. They’ll arrives at 3. Stefan will load their luggage from their van into their rooms. Regino will do the luggage handling for them on Thursday at noon.\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    New schedule is up, guest starring Amazing Elena & Extraordinary Tory in “night shifts” here at ELEMENTS & Lovely Lilly in a special appearance as “breakfasts queen” down at Bird Rock. RE: Seattle girl getaway: Tue 8/19 & Wed 8/20 would work better schedule wise.\r\n\r\n    Great job everybody, each and every one of you rocks my world.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    What a crazy day!! I have been lucky enough to have a pretty quiet night though…but oh my what would we have done without Steffi earlier! Steffi, you are amazing…I would never be able to do what you did.\r\n\r\n    #1103356 NO SHOW…I charged him and printed out the invoice and made keys. I called and left a message but his phone is off.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it…see you at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 6:50 pm\r\n\r\n    ROMANCE\r\n    Today was the second Romance package in 3 days we had no record of whatsoever. I believe after processing the reservation WRP defaulted back to “no romance”. Therefore it is crucial to print out all online reservations, circle the add-on requested, double check the basket and organize the add-ons for guests. Due to uncanny teamwork all was good though.\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    We had 4 clipper reservation trying to check-in today and we had no record of them, we never got a fax from Clipper, but one of us must have released the block. Luckily we found room at the BW for those guests, one of them not happy at all, understandingly. If any of those guests wish to use our pool or check out bikes, by all means, let them (their names are on a clipper voucher copy in Cindy’s box).\r\n    What did we learn from that? Never ever release the clipper block without a clipper fax on hand.\r\n\r\n    201\r\n    Guests will go on 3 day kayak trip. They’ll leave before our office opens. They’ll have their bags packed and luggage tagged in the room. Please have HK bring the bags into our luggage room.\r\n\r\n    But let’s not dwell on the negative. Gio sold 12 cinnamon buns in 5 minutes this morning, old friends are having a glass of wine by the pool, little girls with brand new stuffed animals are sneaking their 4th hot chocolate while mom isn’t looking, lovers are holding hands in the hot tub, it’s summer!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2008 at 4:26 pm\r\n\r\n    OOOOhhhh MY!!\r\n    I think that we all survived today! A few things…\r\n\r\n    Susie’s Mopeds:\r\n    Carmen called today and said that All guests have to MAke Reservations for any kind of rentals that they offer. Only because we sent some guests down yesterday, and there was nothing for them them when they got there. They were let down a little.. So just tell the guests that it would be a great idea for them to call and reserve!\r\n\r\n    Sunday tomorrow, I hope that it is a smooth day :) Good night ladies! ZZZzzzzz….\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 10:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Good morning Priscilla! I hope your mouth is starting to feel better…\r\n\r\n    #1227151 canceled at the last minute, I called her to see if they were on the late ferry and just heard back from her saying that she was really sorry she hadn’t called but her child got very sick and so they wouldn’t be able to make it. I only charged her the 10% because I figured the situation was out of her hands….\r\n\r\n    That’s about all….I hope your day goes well, see you at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 5:39 pm\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING AT NIGHT (PART XXXXIIIII)\r\n    Tonight, simply press “function” and then “F3″ (like we used to) to put phones through to Frontline. All lines, plus the operator line will be forwarded. Yeah. Thank you phone Bob for making it so easy for us.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 12:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Just ordered coffee from SJ Coffee.\r\n\r\n    ITS CRAZY TODAY!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 25th, 2008 at 9:56 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    Thanks for my little note, Lilly :)\r\n    So, I have been MIA the past few days. I had softball camp the past three days and that didn’t go as planned. First day I ended up messing up my back so I had to sit on the bench and watch the other two days. Not very much fun… :(\r\n    And now, I’m leaving early today to take on my captain duties for Relay for Life.\r\n    If any of you are interested, PLEASE stop by at relay. It is going to be soo neat. It is incredible how many people are there. I would definitely recommend stopping by, especially after dark. The whole track is lite up by candles. It is awesome. I could ramble about it all day :)\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is it for this morning. Just wanted to say hello.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Bye Morgan, have fun, we’ll take good care of our tub, thanks for the spa 101 class.\r\n    Thank you so much, Dave for, fixing it so quick.\r\n    Thank you, Regino, for being the van king all day today. Wow, busy busy busy.\r\n\r\n    WASHER\r\n    The newer washer is out of order (spin cycle issues), Seth is trying to reach a fixing person, just so you all know.\r\n\r\n    LOOK INTO THE FUTURE\r\n    Whenever you are idle, go through upcoming reservations and make sure we have no loose ends. Also look at the availability calendar and make sure we don’t have any over bookings (rooms UNIREZ “creates”, but don’t have a room assigned). If you catch one of those, let me know asap.\r\n\r\n    Be strong and calm and kind and eat your fresh mouth emporium offers. Much Love.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 24th, 2008 at 3:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Ok pool news.\r\n\r\n    Well everything is looking good so far. I will give the hot tub a once over right before I leave. It mostly just needs to warm up. The pool should be fine for while I am gone. The big thing people are going to need to keep an eye on is the water levels. The pool should be ok unless there is a whole mess of people slashing all over the place. The hot tub though, needs to be filled almost once a day. The most important thing is to keep the water level over the top of the intake on the side. There is a small hose hanging on side of the shelf in the chem room. You just need to hook it up to the faucet on the outside wall and let it run a bit. It’s about 10min per inch of water. If you all could be responsible for keeping an eye on the level (perhaps you lovely cafe ladies?) Steffi knows how to add water, as well as Seth and Regino. It’s not too hard :) . I will have my cell so please call me if you have any questions. I will be reachable almost the entire time although I don’t know how well I will have service in Blaine. But I will try not to leave you hanging. BYE!!!!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 23rd, 2008 at 2:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Good evening everyone!\r\n    Room 118 if someone could get a hold of the guest to see if Seth could go in and quickly fix the bathroom ceiling fan! AWESOME! I received a package from visions espresso…..with the grinder part Laura and I have been waiting for…..I was so exited until……..THEY SENT ME THE WRONG FREAKING MODEL PARTS!!!!!! They sent me the home version and not the commercial version. ERRRGHHHHH…I think that will be the time I go through them! To many mix ups, and non shipments! Sorry Laura! I called Rancilio and left a message to go through them and get the right parts ASAP! Thats my project for now. Soon we will get you you’re grinder back :(\r\n    I think that is all folks! Chao\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Ohaiyo gozaimasu miina-san! Genki desu ka? Honto ne? Yosh! Ikimasu!\r\n\r\n    Jut a few things for the morning:\r\n\r\n    #1234758 need to have massages confirmed w/ the spa. I had spoken to Dana right before she closed and the times were available. They need 3 separate 60min Swedish massages at 5:15 on 8/16. The names of all three of the ladies getting the treatments are in the rez.\r\n\r\n    Steffi, those folks who had all the massage treatments you booked; I can’t get a hold of them. I have called everyday and left a message on the number you left.\r\n\r\n    Hot Tub update. Just so you all know the story. When I came in to to my usual daily check-up there was water spraying out the side of the hot tub filter pump. Not the pipe but the actual pump itself. It is shut down because without that pump we can’t run the heater. Rob is calling his distributors and is trying to get a new pump here as fast has he can. Please tell people that we are really sorry about the breakdown. Because we are on an island it’s sometimes hard to get specialized equipment here in a timely manner. So… Bottom line. The hot tub could open tomorrow or in a week. It’ll take as long as it takes. :( Not the best time for me to be gone for a few days is it? Sorry.\r\n\r\n    Oh and in case anyone is wondering. I did order Hot Cocoa from Sysco on Sunday. We should hopefully get it soon.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s it for me tonight. Arigatou Gozaimasu! Oyasumi Nasai!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 22nd, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Afternoon! So nothing too eventful this morning…the Victoria Clipper called and I told them that we will have to charge them for #1126345 even though she left a day early.\r\n\r\n    #1217810 canceled her kayaking trip this morning with Outdoor Odysseys and I told her that we have to still charge her because of OO’s cancellation policy. She was totally fine with that.\r\n\r\n    Broken foot man canceled his reservation w/ us and I called SJO and canceled his kayaking as well.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, there’s not a whole lot that went on this morning.\r\n\r\n    See you guys on Thursday!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 11:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Mornin All! Just a couple of little things.\r\n\r\n    - Room 106 borrowed a laundry basket from the laundry room. They are leaving early so please let Raquel know it’s in there.\r\n\r\n    - Reservation numbers 1225254 and 1232154 were no-shows. Please charge them accordingly in the morning.\r\n\r\n    - Victoria Clipper reservation #1126345 is checking out day early. Please read the notes I left in the rez.\r\n\r\n    - Reservation #1232035 is checking out on the 24th and had put something from the gift shop on his room. I noticed late last night that we don’t have his card saved on file. We always need to make sure we save the card number when you make a new reservation. :)\r\n\r\n    - A very light, minor, caffeine-free, diet-gripe. I know it’s busy for the morning people. But please, if you can, try to remember to check all the guests out. That way when we have a rush at 3pm we aren’t getting errors from the system telling us that people are still checked into the room. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Congrats to Lilly on her new wheels. Makes me jealous. Say… Think I can borrow it for the weekend? :) (renting a car stinks)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    The ice machine is fixed. :)\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I have a call into WEBREZPRO, if you get a hold of Kyle I would really like to talk to him.\r\n    If any of you receive a call from WEBREZ, please pass them along to me.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 10:41 am\r\n\r\n    Me again\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    Call Kris at Western Prince\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 9:52 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning!\r\n    Steffi- The no shows last night.. I think you dealt with, but I put the invoices in your box just in case.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    Kyle from webrez called. You know the deal– I think. Number is 1-800-221-3429 ext 217\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 21st, 2008 at 8:57 am\r\n\r\n    Good Monday Morning:)\r\n    I just want to let you all know what FABULOUS job you are all doing. Well done on the great Trip Advisor review. Let’s keep them coming.\r\n    Music\r\n    As Khaili said below, we are having a jazz singer come and play in the pool patio on Thursday July 31 from 5pm to 7pm. Tell all our guests that are checking in and making a reservation about it. Feel free to check out her myspace, it has a demo of her Music.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Stefan on Monday morning could you please take bike #6 over to the bike shop.\r\n    Laura and Adam\r\n    They are going to be out of town off and on for the rest of the month, please direct all issues for them to me or Steffi.\r\n    Thanks you all, I really appreciate what a great team you are. I just can’t say it enough…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 11:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Not too bad tonight. Except for the ferries being over an hour late after the 5:05.\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Rooms 334 and 339 were no shows at closing. We may need to talk to the folks in 101 because these are rooms made for their people. One of the names mentioned in the notes has his own room under his own name for last night. It’s all very confusing.\r\n\r\n    BIKE STUFF\r\n    One of the orange bike’s (I forgot to get the number) seat is all wonky. It seems that not only is it tilted way too far back but one of the springs has fallen through the retaining ring thus twisting the seat at a odd angle. I have but it up on my front porch to keep it out of circulation. Can we perhaps have Seth look at it? If doesn’t think he can fix it we may have to take it to Paul or swipe the seat off of the “parts bike.”\r\n\r\n    Gio’s cinnamon rolls are indeed yummy. They need raisins though. ;) mmm… Thanks for the info on the green tea gum Steffi.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 7:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Gio, for fixing my car lights, you rocked my little insecure world!\r\n    Take care, Priscilla, I hope you aren’t in too much pain after they take your wisdom away. Let us know if you need something.\r\n    Morgan, the green tea gum came from MP, over by the healthy treats, next to the mixers.\r\n    Have a good couple of days, everybody. Good weekend, you all worked hard. Thank you.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    *Whistling*\r\n    Went REALLY smoothly today. SO MUCH LUGGAGE. I will be done in the kitchen for the baking.\r\n    I went down and purchased disinfectant for thehelmets. Its the Lysol in the back above where we store th e luggage. MMMmmmm smells fresh! Nothing else I think. Once again, My friday has crept up on me. Every one have a good monday and tuesday! Ciao\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 2:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everybody!\r\n\r\n    Wow. the bikes were popular this morning, there must have been a fleet of them out on the streets (haha, bad joke)\r\n\r\n    I’m going to be out of the office for a few days but i set you all up with folded key envelopes (and extras already folded behind) and also napkin/silverwear sets :)\r\n\r\n    The Lawyer group returned the kitchen key which was borrowed so they could move their stuff in when Relay for Life was in the conference center.\r\n\r\n    Gio let me try one of her yuuuummy gooooey cinnamon rolls this morning. MMMMMMM!!! I have to say it was very delicious!!\r\n\r\n    OH yeah. And remember when closing and lock up EVERYTHING, everything.\r\n\r\n    I’ll be gone for a few days but feel free to facebook meeee!! i will be home in bed with chipmonk cheeks, hehe. See you next weekend.\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 20th, 2008 at 12:24 am\r\n\r\n    RANDOM STUFF FOR SUNDAY 7/20\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    Guest would like to see if they could get another luggage rack please. Also their phone does not appear to be working. It may just need to be plugged in correctly. It was late and she didn’t want me to come in and look at it. Can you please have Regino look at it in the morning? He may have to take them a new phone. They are on the top most shelf behind the door in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    215\r\n    These folks are our accidental 2009 reso. They will be moving to 323 on Sunday. I have put that in the housekeeping notes but can you please ask them to take care of that room as soon as possible and to let you know when it’s done? These folks aren’t too happy about their situation so we should try to make their stay as pleasant as we can.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n\r\n    Bike #6\r\n    #6’s front wheel is a little bent. I don’t think it’s bad enough that the bike shop can’t true it. I don’t know if we can take it to them on a Sunday but either way I put #6 inside the fence instead of keeping it out with all the others. Marina said she rode it one night and noticed the wobble.\r\n\r\n    Well thankfully I think that’s about it. Good luck with the check-outs. Thanks!\r\n\r\n    P.S. Steffi’s Fresh Breath Emporium is out of green tea gum. That was good stuff. Where did you get that? Gourmet Galley? Mark ‘n’ Pak(otherwise known as FH Market Place)? Or though your super-special co-op connections? I want to get some. …nummers…\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE ROOM\r\n    Hey all. Sorry to do this but the folks using the conference room have requested that NO ONE go in there while they are using it. If Gio has to use the kitchen they want to be informed first. They also do not want housekeeping to come in. They found one of the doors locked but ajar this afternoon and were very concerned. So. Because they have sensitive materials in there can we try to respect their wishes until they check out? They will let us know if they need anything. Thanks and sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 8:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    We are hosting a jazz night (you can read about it on the events calender) and I made some flyers for it. They are in the basket that we put the online reservations in.\r\n    GIO-\r\n    Could you put one in the cafe?\r\n\r\n    Sweet!\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is all for now.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 19th, 2008 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Sooo….we are all booked for tonight! All the B&B’s are booked, the Friday Harbor House is full but the Best Western has a few rooms available.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    SNAFU CENTRAL\r\n    Like Steffi said we found a few rooms that were mistakenly made for 2009 when they should have been for 2008. Most of them were moved without incident but 2 of them are now special cases. The one we need to worry about is a room for Saturday. Rezo #1160590 will be here for 2 days. I have left a message on their phone with instructions to call us. They have 3 options for rooms. 1) They can have our emergency hold room (215) for two nights. 2) They can have 215 then move to a Sky Place for the last night. 3) They can cancel with no penalty and we can help them find a room elsewhere. No matter what they choose please try to be as helpful and as kind as possible. You can discount their room as you need. Use your best judgment, we want them to be happy. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n    POOL DOOR\r\n    The pool door has stopped working. It is not making any flashing lights so I think the batteries might be dead. I will try to find the time and the tools to fix it tonight but I have also left a message on Seth’s phone. If I don’t see Seth I will try to wake up early and fix it if I don’t get it done tonight. I’ll update the blog if I take care of it.\r\n\r\n    335\r\n    The guests in 335 might want to move. They are not happy with the noise above. I think we can swap them into 338 for the rest of their stay. I am sure you will hear something from them in the morning. (Although I hope you won’t.)\r\n\r\n    Busy busy night either way. I am sorry for so many alarms and I hope the morning goes as easily as possible for you. Peace out!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 7:23 pm\r\n\r\n    The Winters\r\n    A super sweet pregnant couple made reservations with us by accident for 2009. We were able to put them up at the BW, all is good. I encouraged them to please use our facilities, so if they want to use the pool or our bikes, please let them as per moi.\r\n\r\n    2009\r\n    So after that M & I had the great idea to look for other reservations made for 2009 and we found a handful, some had add-ons, so these people are coming this year. We moved them and made notes. Guys, always call guests if they made reservations for 2009. It’s an easy mistake to make and we can avoid a lot of frustration that way.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 6:22 pm\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONS\r\n    We have some issues with not having enough or the wrong info regarding add-ons, like sending guests to Roche Harbor instead of our port here for a kayak trip, sending guests to places at the wrong time, with the wrong company and what not. Of course that is totally unacceptable and not how we want to treat our guests.\r\n    Please write in the guest remarks:\r\n    1) when, where, who, what, how many: 7/18, 6 PM, 3 hour kayak tour with San Juan Outfitters out of Roche Harbor, 2 adults\r\n    2) fee added, confirmed, voucher made (if not, make an alarm, explaining what needs to be done, exactly: voucher needed, confirmation needed, don’t write: follow up, that’s not enough)\r\n    3) Today’s date and your initials (I want to know who you are, always)\r\n    Too much information is better than too little. Write away. And even if it’s busy and stressful and all that, remember: we do this to make our guest’s stay more pleasant. This is their vacation, make it fabulous. Be focused and kind.\r\n\r\n    I replenished the fresh mouth emporium, check out green tea or lemon tea gum, put that mint in your mouth!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 5:02 pm\r\n\r\n    332 is good. Regino was working on it this morning. Everything went well. We are super busy :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 4:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Can someone go to Browne’s today or tomorrow and pickup 45 sink strainers from John in the plumbing department. Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA SIGN\r\n    Gary from the city came by and asked us to move our sign onto our property, it is not allowed on the side walk. Please remember when you put it out in the morning.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    can anyone work my monday evening shift at bird rock on the 21st? i was hoping to participate in a heavy rescue drill at the fire department. it only happens once a month and is required credit for my emt certification. it is a 3-11 shift monday the 21st. please help me out???\r\n\r\n    kaitlyn\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 18th, 2008 at 9:35 am\r\n\r\n    Phone Forwarding\r\n    Come and see Cindy for a little lesson, it works just fine, I tried it 3 times this am, I will run through with each of you. :)\r\n    NIGHT TIME\r\n    For now the rooms that call the front office after hours are not being forwarded to Frontline, they come into the office and receive the front desk message. It now has a recording on it that says if they reach the front offices after 11pm and before 8am, to please call the night manager. 317-7567..\r\n    Uniform\r\n    Don’t forget your brown pants and blue shirts, if you are cold wear a white long sleeve underneath your blue shirt. You all look so spiffy when you are dressing the same:)\r\n    SETH\r\n    Seth is leaving Friday at 9:30am, he will be off island today but back later tonight. So if you have any issues please call Regino.\r\n    Welcome back Priscilla, how was orientation?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 9:14 pm\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Bathtub doesn’t drain. Please have Seth look at it after noon (12)tomorrow (it’s a long stay).\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING\r\n    I just tested the forwarding to explain it to Lilly and it doesn’t let me punch in the forwarding number (busy signal, console says “wrong number”), aaarrgh.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 8:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodmorning Khai :) So I have set about 5 alarms for tomorrow morning….I’m sorry, people just aren’t picking up their phones tonight!! But you can just leave them alone and I will take care of them when I come in at 9, I just didn’t want you to be completely overwhelmed! See you at 9 missy :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 5:27 pm\r\n\r\n    PHONE FORWARDING\r\n    As of tonight we will forward the 4000 to the call center at night. How? See instructions on back desk. Thank you Cindy for your never ending energy to get this finally figured out. yeah!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN RING TRAVEL\r\n    Beware when processing ART faxes: if it says ‘Reservation Request’ on top of the page, make a new reservation. If it says ‘Rooming List’, the reservation has been made already and we simply need to double check dates, length of stay etc., before faxing it back.\r\n\r\n    DOUBLE CHECKING\r\n    Don’t forget to double check online reservations, clipper faxes, etc. in the basket on the back desk, daily, always, it needs to be part of your daily routine. Please read Cindy’s memo on the subject and initial.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 12:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan-\r\n    1028844 call these people. They need to talk to you. You know the deal.\r\n    Zeus and Thor say: Says:\r\n    July 17th, 2008 at 8:25 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Mr. Esspike\r\n    We really like your summer tips. One more thing to add, if you want to go to a REALLY fun doggy camp, try Down Town Dog, 360.378.0981 (you can use your mom’s new cell phone) you get to load up on the Bow Wow Bus and they take you to all kinds of really fun swimming holes when it is hot,(even when it’s not) they also take you on long walks in the woods or to the beach. We get to go once or twice a week, but if my parents forget to take us, or they decide we can skip a few times I (Thor) get really obnoxious with my tennis ball and won’t leave my parents alone so finally they get it that I need some extra hard play time with the rest of the dog gang at Down Town Dog.\r\n    Lavender, that sounds like a fun thing, can you eat it? I like to taste everything, sometimes my family thinks I am part goat..\r\n    I (Zeus) really like baby carrots, they taste so good when they come right out of the cold refrigerator, they are good for my eyes too.\r\n    Stay cool our fellow black lab. Maybe we will catch you at the local swimming hole soon. Anyone seen Roxi???\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 11:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Goodmorning Khaili! Hope I closed everything up right…it was pretty slow this evening, no major issues that I can think of. See you all at 3!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 8:51 pm\r\n\r\n    341\r\n    Door didn’t open, blinked green, but didn’t open. Amazing Seth came by, interrupting his dinner, opened the door but couldn’t fix it. Moved guests (read file). Please please please make double extra sure that 341 gets cleaned after Seth fixes the lock. Room is blocked out until Sat.\r\n    Mr. Esspike Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 4:07 pm\r\n\r\n    BE COOL – SUMMER TIPS FOR THE BIG BLACK DOG\r\n    As we all know we can only loose heat through our tongue or feeties. Have your people put a water bone (ice cube) on your feeties. It cools you right off. If you like, twitch and growl a little, they’ll give you a treat in addition to keeping you cool.\r\n    I get aspirin after walks, because my hips are bad and I’m old. My Steffi puts it in a bread ball or a cheese ball. Leave the bread ball in your mouth for a bit, then spit out the aspirin, you’ll get way more treats that way.\r\n    As you undoubtedly noticed, the flea season has arrived. It’s not as bad as last year. If you are like me and don’t like pesticides, have your people comb you daily, then spray lavender toner on you (Laura gave some to my Steffi from the Palindaba store). It’s good against hot spots too and makes you smell like old lady. Remember not to visit with Morgan after using lavender toner, he gets sneezy. Eat lot’s of garlic and brewer’s yeast. My treats come in that taste and the bugs don’t like the smell. If your people aren’t forthcoming with the treats, just sit in front of the treat bag for an hour, they always break.\r\n    Well, my fellow black dogs, these are my summer tips. Remember, always lick your people first and then your privates, humans like it better that way.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    UNDERSTAFFED\r\n    Sweeties, over the next couple of weeks we are skeleton staffed. Please be on time, work hard, think ahead and make it easy on the person working after you. Especially at Bird Rock, do as much as you possibly can for the following shift. I won’t be around much, working the desk at ELEMENTS, but call me if there are issues. I can always do a store run, etc.\r\n    A couple of other random things: if you promise something to a guest (like an early check in), write a note in that guest’s file. Please don’t give out room numbers before check-in time, things can change.\r\n    This is it, this is what we are working towards all year. Be focused, keep your spirits high and be kind.\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    There is a lil’ package, on the desk. Came from guest # 1194995. It is a pillow from her grandmother. Its very special to her. So I have the whole shipment label ect… just need to be taken up to the San Juan post.\r\n    guest # 1224301, we were told to charge the card that is on file. The card that is on file does not want to go through. Read the notes in remark’s and see if you have problems like I did. We need to figure out another card that we can charge to pay for this room. Lets see…..I’ll probably write more after my shift :>\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 16th, 2008 at 12:30 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG\r\n    Where are all my bloggers? This blog is lonely.. Don’t forget to blog at least once EVERY shift.\r\n    Massage\r\n    I had a massage for my neck on Monday and Richard Wills gave an awesome massage, for anyone that likes a deep tissue massage it was amazing.\r\n    Steam shower\r\n    spa d bune has a steam shower, if you have guests that are interested, it is $20 for one session..\r\n    Keep up the great work everyone..\r\n    :)\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW-UP\r\n\r\n    I processed three webervations tonight that need phone calls about whale watching/kayaking/and massages.\r\n\r\n    #1221953\r\n\r\n    #1222039\r\n\r\n    #1222118\r\n\r\n    EVERYONE:\r\n    Please read about #1057474- it is very important that if she calls everyone knows what is going on, she is already a little upset about the mixed up charges on their cards.\r\n\r\n    By the way-\r\n    Thank you everyone for the happy birthdays! it was so fun and the cake was extremely tastey!! :)\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow afternoon ♥\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 4:15 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRISCILLA AND TORY :) :):):) I AM SORRY I AM NOT THERE TO GIVE YOU BOTH BIG HUGS THIS AFTERNOON.. MY NECK DECIDED IT NEEDED AN IMMEDIATE BREAK, SO I AM AT HOME WITH THE HEATING PAD.. HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY EVER, YOU BOTH DESERVE IT..\r\n    Laura and Adam are out of the office. I think they may be back at the end of the week. Please pass anyone to me if they need immediate attention.\r\n    STEFAN\r\n    Did you eat today????\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I am going to get a phone like yours, remember when you copied my Razor??\r\n    Khaili\r\n    See you at home\r\n    Have a great afternoon everyone:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 14th, 2008 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    UPDATES\r\n    1) We have an update on the refund we are trying to do for reso #1028844. It turns out that since the transaction was done over 120 days ago, our system won’t allow us to refund it. We have sent in paperwork to Authorize.net that, once approved, will allow us to refund the amount. I have left a message on the guest’s phone informing them of this but if they call please just pass on the message that we should know in the next day or so if we can refund the card or, if we will have to mail them a check to refund them.\r\n\r\n    2) I have also talked to the originating travel agent for the folks up here for the trial. She is going to try and cancel the room through her system so we won’t get charged the commission for a 13 day stay. If she cannot cancel through her system she will call Unirez to inform them not to charge us for that reservation. She should be calling us later today to let me know how it went. Hopefully everything will go smoothly.\r\n\r\n    Ask me if you have questions. Thanks!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 7:13 pm\r\n\r\n    A very expensive white bathing suit was thought to be left here last night. The reservation number is 1212337 if it comes up.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 2:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello!!\r\n    We all got through the weekend! Totally sold out! Everything went really smoothly I must add ;) Just a few things….\r\n    Guest# 1028844 has not been refunded yet! A few of the bike seats are broken. Three of them have no numbers on them. Errrrr. And also Natalia will probably run out of milk again before I leave. I am going to be off this mon and tue. So could you guys check up on her, and make sure that some could get her milk. Morgan ran and got her some milk today, but shes been busy out there! Let ALL the guests know that WE have the best coffee in town! Well everyone have a great couple of days! I’m outta here.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 2:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Sunny days :)\r\n\r\n    POST SAN JUAN\r\n    Tomorrow morning (7.14.. Priscilla’s birthday!) someone needs to bring a small package up to Post San Juan. It is important that it is brought up because it is insulin and the man who left it needs it soon. The package is in the refrigerator so when the second morning person gets here, if one of you (Morgan or Stephan) could bring it up there, that would be awesome!\r\n    I made this a lot more difficult that it needed to be.. whoops.\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 13th, 2008 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    TRIAL PEOPLE\r\n    I reserved the conference center for our trial having guests through next week (except for Tuesday, 7/15, when we have relay for life). I didn’t charge them yet, since the third room issue is not resolved. I said we would take $50 per night. Please charge once the third room issue is resolved.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 10:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hookay. Lots of randomness for you tomorrow. Here’s the biggie.\r\n    1) First the back-story. #209148163 technically has three rooms. #209597162 and #209150841 are the other two. They are here for 13 days each and all three reservations were made by a travel agent and sent in via Unirez. They are up here for court and “were” going to use #209597162 and #209150841 to sleep in and use #209148163 as an office for the duration of the stay. A bit over an hour or so after checking-in and paying for the rooms, they called and said that they no longer wanted to keep #209148163. There is a slight problem with letting them go on it. First off, it’s a huge 13 day stay and they are canceling it the day of. The other problem is that since the reservation came in via Unirez, we are going to be charged commission for this room from the originating travel agent. I told the guest in charge, now staying in #209597162 that I would have to charge them for last night pending getting in contact with the travel agent to have them rescind the commission fee for that room. Right now the full amount of the 13 day stay is charged as a cancellation fee on room #209148163. Perhaps if Steffi is in tomorrow she can decide how we want to handle refunding the guest or not. I have left a message on the travel agent’s phone but they will not be open until Monday. I have talked to the male guest in #209597162 and they know the whole deal. Ask me if you have questions.\r\n\r\n    2) There is a day spa voucher on the back desk that needs to make its way to the spa office in the morning. It was for one of our guests who walked in to make a spa treatment res. and then asked to have it paid through their room. The voucher is just for the spa’s book-keeping records.\r\n\r\n    3) Tory made a reservation for a guest (#1219217) who is moving from the Friday Harbor House to here tomorrow. They will be calling to get a ride from the FHH to ELEMENTS at around 9:30am. Raquel says that Regino will be around to run the van. Apparently the guests have a lot of luggage. They know that they will not be able to get into their room early but they do want to drop off their luggage.\r\n\r\n    4) The guest in #1192120 had us help surprise his wife with some last minute roses. He paid with his credit card but we forgot to get the receipt from San Juan Florist. Can you call them in the morning to get the total for their flowers? Thanks.\r\n\r\n    5) I am still having problems trying to refund the initial payment in room #1028844. We need to refund that $136.25 to the first card on the list. WRP gives me an error when I try to refund it and Authorize.net has the wrong password apparently. If the guest come in asking about it, please just let her know we are still working on it and we may have to have Cindy do it on Monday. :(\r\n\r\n    I think that about covers it. *wheww* Let me know if you have questions. I’ll probably be joining the world of the living around 8-9ish. :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 6:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again-\r\n\r\n    I probably could save this until I have something else to say tonight, but here I go.. again…\r\n    GIO\r\n    I filled out the voucher that you asked me to, but I wasn’t sure how long of a trip that was. I left the envelope on the back desk, so if you could fill that out, that would me awesome.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 3:48 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m back :D\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    Tomorrow (The 13th) the people who were in the hideaway are moving up here to the Wind. They are going to need some help with luggage in the morning at 9:30 so if you could give Regino a call and have him head down there in the van, that would be awesome. They will pay for the Wind place when when they get here to drop off their luggage.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    Wow! it sure is picking up..we are SOLD OUT.\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP\r\n    the room service invoice was returned and charged.\r\n    Linden’s reservations and vouchers are all confirmed.\r\n\r\n    ONE THING\r\n    #1207807- This reservation is staying here with us at the moment. They needed to cancel a spot on a WW trip, but we didn’t have the card on file. I called their room and left a message for the BROOKS card to come to the office and be refunded.\r\n\r\n    Also, Do we have comment cards? I think they would be a great thing to have handy.\r\n\r\n    By the way i attended the Seattle Brass Quintet’s performance and it was amazing!!!! They were all students at UW.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 2:04 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S.\r\n    The luggage from reservation #1022561 is in the back. Has her name on them. She will not have the tags\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 1:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello :)\r\n    Beautiful day! The weather is incredible.\r\n\r\n    Just a quick little note:\r\n    There is a set of keys on the back desk. They are for reservation number 1154981. They should be stopping by to grab them.\r\n\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 12th, 2008 at 12:40 am\r\n\r\n    Yay blogging from home. 314, 336, 338, 341 finally did show up. They had me split the room 7 ways. That was fun. There is an amount of $136.25 that needs to be refunded to the card on file on rooms “336, 338, & 341.” I kept getting an error so maybe Steffi can you take a look tomorrow? Thanks. Please let me know if you have any questions. hokay… bed time.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST #1188048\r\n    Guest has a Sea/Sky package. Please read the notes in his file and give him the vouchers on the back desk. Please make sure to tell him that he needs to bring a lunch and some water for the trip. The Crystal Seas shuttle departs the waterfront at 10:30am. Call him if you don’t see them by 9:00am. Also apologize for me that I didn’t have the vouchers for him when he checked it. I hope he doesn’t think I was rude. :(\r\n\r\n    GUEST #1202343\r\n    Guest had ordered room service with explicit instructions to have the food in the room by 10pm. The guests where not in the room so Khaili just left it there with the Hot Bag and the clipboard w/ the receipt. Khaili was kind enough to stick around and take care of this because I had a lot of check-ins still left from the 9:30pm boat. Sadly I did not get the amount total. I did tell the guests, who came by later, that we will need to have both the signed receipt and the hot bag back in the morning. Please make sure we get those.\r\n\r\n    FRONTLINE\r\n    The call center and I talked a lot this evening. She was doing test calls and nothing of ours was making it to the call center. Bird rock was doing fine but she couldn’t get anything to work. Almost all phone calls were being rolled into the “5800″ line. I had several complaints that people trying to leave messages were being disconnected once typing “3001.” Many of the messages I did get were just hang-ups. I was swamped and I admittedly missed a few calls but I did notice that they were ringing for a long time before disappearing. Who knows just how many of the calls I missed made it to voicemail…\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Rooms 314, 336, 338, & 341 were all now shows at closing. They are all under the same name and Khaili said that she spoke with them earlier in the day. So I wonder what happened.\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-INS\r\n    Guest #1180164 was an after hours check-in. Please make sure we get a copy of her invoice in the morning.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA-\r\n    There is a pink sticky note for you on the back desk. Your name is on it, and it is for you to call this lady back. She said that she is the person taking you down to Seattle U’s orientation…?\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 11th, 2008 at 2:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Room 340, #1022561. She will be leaving all of her luggage in her room, because she is leaving really early and then not coming back until after 3pm…so will one of the morning persons please go and grab all of her luggage from her room and put it in our luggage room? Thank you soooo much!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 11:08 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Bikes number #1 and #9 both need air in their front tires.\r\n    The license-less one parked near those two has loose handlebars.\r\n\r\n    LAUNDRY ROOM MADNESS\r\n    The breaker keeps shutting off in the laundry room. At first i thought that the ice machine was broken, but after i talked to Dave he told me it was a breaker problem. So i learned how to fix the breaker, but it happened again. and again. Pretty soon by the end of the night the breaker blew 4 times in a row while i was trying to get ice. Also, every time i turned the breaker back on, the washer and dryer that were interrupted turned back on again. They were stuck mid cycle.\r\n\r\n    PHONE MESSAGE\r\n    Sorry to leave this behind, but there was one phone message that needs to be returned. They need to switch the dates of their stay- the name and number are on the back desk on the message log.\r\n\r\n    NIGHTLINE\r\n    I am following the directions as written but can’t get through to the dial tone. Can someone help me?? Morgan told me to remember to press (9) first, and i do that, but it still lacks a dial tone. Instead i hear that phone voice that tells you to dial again. If i don’t press (9) then nothing happens at all…\r\n\r\n    EXTRA\r\n    The white paper cups we use in the lobby. I tried to restock them, but i do not know where their new hiding spot is.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 8:10 pm\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT part 2098:\r\n    When closing out a room to be cleaned the following day, please do the following: mark the room as “closed” in the Unite Closeout section of WRP. Then write in the HK report that the room needs cleaning. Then, once the room is cleaned, erase the note out of the HK report, since it will stay there and will not clear on the following day. What? Ask me if that doesn’t make sense. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 4:05 pm\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    The pool patio keys live above the front desk door (the one with the swinging doors). Please return them to their home every time to use them.\r\n\r\n    304\r\n    The guest who will check into room 304 have some food and a bottle of wine in our employee fridge. Please give it to them when they check in.\r\n\r\n    VOUCHERS\r\n    Our gift certificates (vouchers) are in my computer under front desk resources – maps and logos – spa voucher.\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    Please empty the garbage and the coffee, do the dishes, deal with the emails in the in-box, process new online reservations every night before you leave. I know there are some things which are hard to do at night, like booking massages, but please make it nice for the person working after you (there is no “I” in team ELEMENTS!)\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    July 10th, 2008 at 7:58 am\r\n\r\n    Good morning to all!\r\n    KEYS KEYS….misplaced keys. I opened with Lilly this morning and the patio was locked. This is fine in all, but when the patio key is misplaced, it makes it VERY hard to open Cafe Zia. So if it could be nicely put in the cafe zia keys or the pool keys, or somewhere the early morning girls can find it. That would be awesome!! Thanks\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    Ok, I don’t know if I am just off this night or if the gift certificates have been put somewhere only the boss ladies can find them but, when I went to open them so I could print some I couldn’t find them anywhere. Sorry… I didn’t get them printed out tonight.\r\n\r\n    Geez! the office is soooo stuffy.\r\n\r\n    Laura, did you find your camera? I’ll bring the VHS-DVD combo unit for you tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    IT’S ALL ABOUT THE DATES\r\n    Please always always always read the dates of a reservation back to the guest after making a reservation. And, and I can’t stress this enough, double check the dates when checking a guest in as well. Then, when making the room key, double check the room WRP assigned with the room key you just made. I know it gets hectic during check-ins, but this needs to be done, every time.\r\n\r\n    FILING SCHOOL\r\n    After you double checked clipper assignments or online reservations, please file the hard copy in the file cabinet under the fax machine. And: put the online reservation in the online reservations folder, the clipper into the clipper folder, the HK report in the housekeeping report folder. Then: the newest piece of paper always goes in the front of the folder. Got that? There will be a test next Wednesday!\r\n\r\n    Alles Liebe zum Geburtstag, Raquel, we love you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 1:38 pm\r\n\r\n    BAG TAGS\r\n    Pleas have all guest last names on the bag tags when you store them in the baggage room. This makes it MUCH easier, when you go hunting for the bag when requested by the guests.\r\n    WEBREZPRO\r\n    If there are any weird issues with WEBREZ could you please print out the invoice, put a note on it, then set it in my box. :)\r\n    GARBAGE\r\n    Everyone, regardless of what job you have, front desk or housekeeping, PLEASE pick up all garbage, small paper, cigarette butts etc…\r\n    Thanks so much,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 9th, 2008 at 9:12 am\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RAQUEL….. Have a wonderful birthday Ms. Raquel… :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW BIKE PROCEDURES\r\n    Per Cindy, from now on we will be locking up the bikes at night and when they are on the racks. This is to help us keep track of the bikes during the day and combat a recent rash of “late-night” bike borrowings by guests unknown. I have made up two 15′ lengths of cable. We also have 2 new padlocks that are keyed to the same key (Yay! one less key!). The front desk has a key right inside the saloon doors in the office, Cafe Zia gets one to keep in their cash bag/register and we have 2 extras in the safe.\r\n    At night, link the cables together and lock up all the bikes together. During the day, one cable will go on one rack and one cable will go on another. When a guest checks the bike out we will go with them to unlock the bike, help them size the seat, and write down the number of bike used. When the bike is returned we need to go out and re-lock the bike to the rack. Since there are so many of us on shift at any given time we hopefully should be able to pull this off. :)\r\n    The procedure will last like this until the summer dies down or we get individual locks for each bike again. I am sorry for the confusion this is going to cause Natalia Wednesday morning. I will leave Cafe Zia’s key and some instructions in their cash bag. Hopefully it’ll go alright for her. If you have questions please ask me or Cindy. Thanks!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Fax Machine\r\n    The fax toner is out, there was a thought that we had an extra toner in the back office, we don’t, so the fax machine is out of commission until the order comes in on Wednesday from SJ Office Center. The fax machine will store the faxes and when we put the new toner in,they will all print out. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, keep looking on outlook, you can then print anything you need to my back printer.\r\n    NEW FLASH**** Morgan just found the old, old toner cartridge, he will put it back in and we may get some faxes out of it…\r\n    COFFEE CUPS\r\n    Please do not order anymore coffee cups for the lobby, Raquel says we have LOTS in storage.\r\n    FRONT DOOR\r\n    WOW our front door looks awesome.. Nice and black with out any scratches..\r\n    COUNT DOWN\r\n    Priscilla turns 18 6 days.. Where has the time gone.. HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY PRISCILLA.. :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 8th, 2008 at 2:57 pm\r\n\r\n    The phones were ringing like crazy this morning!\r\n\r\n    Steffi, Morgan, etc.- I made the Colorado HeartCycle room list, it is on the back counter.\r\n\r\n    Other than that, there’s not much going on. See you all on Thursday! I’ll be at Cafe Zia…! :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2008 at 10:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    My first room service since switching to Backdoor Kitchen.\r\n    Also had to set a remote, yay!\r\n\r\n    Lots of guests in the office tonight with questions about the islands. Fun. Fun.\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2008 at 3:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone\r\n\r\n    Those missing remotes..They were put back in the maintenance room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    MORE HEAVEN\r\n    Gio will store pastries she can sell the next morning in my office. These are not up for grabs. Step away from the pastries and put your hand where I can see them!\r\n\r\n    GUEST COMPUTER\r\n    Chris hobbled by today and fixed the guest computer. Yeah, Chris, we all hope your back gets better soon.\r\n\r\n    GUEST LAUNDRY\r\n    The newer guest washer is broken. The plug melted a little and sparked. Khaili put an out-of-order sign on it. It seems to me another job for Super Dave?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Found the remotes in the maintenance shed. Yes, please everybody, leave them in my office.\r\n\r\n    HEAVEN\r\n    Gio baked fresh scones, croissants and cinnamon rolls for cafe zia today. Amazing. Gio and I were fantasizing about moving cafe zia into the lobby in the winter. Adam, that could be our first step for our bar? What do you think?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    REMOTES\r\n    Hi everyone! We are missing a clear, plastic tub full of extra TV remote controls. This tub used to sit next to the safe in the back office. Now it’s a bummer those remotes are missing but the worse part is that our ONLY copies of the 4-5 different instruction booklets for the varying remotes on the property were in that tub too. I have looked just about everywhere but nada. Raquel doesn’t know anything about it either. If anyone sees the Macedonian girls could you post the question to them too? We need this stuff back in to office pronto. If they got thrown away… Keep your eyes open! Thanks!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 9:53 am\r\n\r\n    Everyone: Please do not call Raquel before 2pm today and ask for any kind of housekeeping update, or ask if specific rooms are ready. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 6th, 2008 at 8:46 am\r\n\r\n    Hi Khaili! I’ve been thinking a lot about the car wash idea. I’m a little concerned that there just isn’t enough room in the parking lot to do this. The parking lot has been seeming so crazy lately, I’m worried that this won’t work very well. Yesterday, I couldn’t even turn in to the front lot it was so crowded. I feel really bad because I would LOVE to extend this to you, but this just isn’t the time, I’m afraid. I’m so sorry.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2008 at 10:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Blogging from home :]\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    When I went out to the coffee shop, the fridge was too cold. All the milk, etc. was slushy. I BARELY turned the temperature down, and asked Steffi to check on it in a while. If all of the milk spoils, I take full responsibility.\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    Okay, so I first asked for the 10th of July to do the car wash, but a bunch of my relay team won’t be able to make it, so do you think that Friday the 11th would be okay?\r\n\r\n    Alrighty, thats all for tonight.\r\n    See you tomorrow at 1\r\n\r\n    Khai\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 5th, 2008 at 5:52 pm\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    I updated the bike check-out form (so it makes more sense). Very important: please account for all bikes at night when you put them away.\r\n\r\n    FAN IN 314 BATHROOM\r\n    Super Dave will be able to fix the light, he disconnected the heat and fan for now. We will have to have this fixed when the season is over.\r\n\r\n    WEEKEND\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work, especially Morgan, Lilly & Tory, who spent their 4th of July evening here staffing our desks. This was a big one and you all rocked.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 11:42 am\r\n\r\n    Happy 4th of July to everybody! :)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 10:09 am\r\n\r\n    Me again.. sorry.\r\n    LAURA\r\n    The car wash is for JULY 10th. Not June. Whoops…\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 10:08 am\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Both of the no shows for last night were under the same name. I called him this morning and he knew nothing about the reservations. They were booked for three nights (last night, tonight, and tomorrow night) for two rooms. He said that he came last year at this time, and it looks like the reservation last year, July 5th. He wanted to speak to a manager, so Steffi… :) I will talk to you and go over the details with you when you get here. As for now, Stephan and I are releasing the rooms and trying to resell them!\r\n\r\n    Spring street is already crouded. I love the Fourth Of July!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    July 4th, 2008 at 8:55 am\r\n\r\n    Happy Fourth :)\r\n    David Waldron called. He said Hideaway is ready for tonight.\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    There were a few vouchers on the back desk that are filled out, but don’t have the dates. Were these for something special?\r\n\r\n    MO\r\n    Thanks for all your help with the chairs for the parade!\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    Question for you. My relay for life team was wondering if we could do a car wash June 10th. I was wondering if we could do it on the property. Let me know what you think.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2008 at 9:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Some how the Hideaway was over booked. The guests that checked in came back saying that there was definitely a different person staying there. So, we adjusted the price for them and sent them to an Earth Room. I left a new receipt on the back desk for them in case they would like to pick it up. Why did this happen? There is another reservation coming in tomorrow?? Do we need to find them a room elsewhere?\r\n\r\n    I called David Waldron and the # for Housekeeping and left a message with both numbers asking that they please call us back asap.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 3rd, 2008 at 11:20 am\r\n\r\n    FUZZY THINGS: Don’t forget that when you take a reservation for a pet room, you have to manually enter the pet fee ($15/night). Also, don’t forget to get the critter’s name and enter it in the housekeeping notes so that our housekeepers can set the room up appropriately.\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 10:56 pm\r\n\r\n    UH OH…\r\n    So last night when I tried to forward the calls it would not let me. I dialed 9 then *72 and all I got was a message “we’re sorry but the service is not available on this line” so I tried just *72 and got an error constant beeping. So I tried the other lines and had the exact same problem.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 5:34 pm\r\n\r\n    FORWARDING THE PHONES\r\n    As of today we will forward our phones to Front Line call center at night. How? Read and initial memo on white board. Very important: cancel the forwarding in the morning.\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    As of tomorrow we will track our checked out bikes with a spiffy form Elena or I will make (in bike release form folder). Our exchange students will bring all ELEMENTS bikes to ELEMENTS in the morning and tell the FD staff which bike they have brought back. In the evening they will take a bike home and will tell the FD staff which one they will take home. Yeah! And since we are well staffed currently, when a guest checks out a bike, please go out there with him/her and help find a good bike and write down (on Elena & Steffi’s spiffy bike check-out form)which bike the guest checks out.\r\n\r\n    NOTHING TO DO?\r\n    Check the mid-day procedure list on my bulletin board and do the things on it. Walk through the lobby and gift shop as if you were a guest, then straighten pillows, vacuum, put gift shop in order, replenish coffee station, check flowers. Or walk through the property, pick up cigarette butts, behead dead flowers, pick weeds, check the bikes for air or loose parts.\r\n    Go through upcoming reservations and make sure we didn’t drop the ball somewhere, make sure we have enough vouchers, gift certificates, beach cruiser release forms, pet registrations.\r\n    And if there is really really really nothing at all to do? Read our websites (Bird Rock has some nice new guest reviews, do you know our fall special at ELEMENTS?), read our reviews on Trip Advisor, read the chamber of commerce and the visitor’s bureau websites, in short: learn about your field.\r\n    We have a busy week ahead of us, folks. Let’s be brilliant!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 4:12 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN\r\n    Well it would help if I would be a date and time in the below note to you, Khai I think I am just use to you knowing what I am asking:)\r\n    The chairs of course need to be put out on the morning of the 4th of July..\r\n    Thanks again,\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    July 2nd, 2008 at 4:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello :)\r\n    Thanks Priscilla, it was great to work with you a little last night. Thanks you to you and Lilly for finishing that wonderful key project I gave you.\r\n    Tomorrow (Thursday) Terri Ogle is sending one of his painters to paint the front office door. The door will be taken down, so we will be without door for the day. But the weather should be warm and we will not miss it.. Plus it will be so nice to have a door with out red shinning through.\r\n    Call Center\r\n    Every night the closing person will forward the 1st and 2nd line to the call center, please see Steffi or I for directions. Then every morning, the opening person will have to deactivate the call forward, DON’T forget to ask Steffi and I for directions.\r\n    July 4th\r\n    I hope EVERYONE has a wonderful 4th of July, we will have LOTS of guests and things will be very busy, so slow down, take a deep breath and put on your lovely smiles..\r\n    KHAILI and STEFAN\r\n    Would you be so kind to put out ALL available out door chairs in the front of the hotel on the sidewalk and mark the chairs off with the yellow caution tape and put a sign that says “For ELEMENTS guests”.. Please let all of our guest know as they check in that we will have some reserved chairs and it will be on a first come first serve basis.\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Steffi is going to create a log in and out sheet for the bikes, please look for her instructions on what we are expecting you to keep track of.\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Tell me about the jets in the hot tub????\r\n    STEFFI’S got a cell phone. :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh yeah, did anyone ever mail Steve Mason books. He was the man from elderhostel. He called today saying he hadn’t receieved them, but was pretty sure we had found them???\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 10:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone!\r\n\r\n    Welcome back Cindy :)\r\n\r\n    How’s it goin? Well today Lilly and I sorted through all those extra keys we had laying around and relabeled the key box. In the process we also put all the key lock boxes together. They are in a plastic container on the back desk. Gio could you give those to Seth to put in the maintenence shed today?? Theres also a container of remotes that have been hanging out on the back desk. Where do those go?? Are they there for a reason??\r\n\r\n    Diana and Olycia have bikes #3 and #8\r\n\r\n    NOTE* the guest computer it temporarily out of service. Techie Chris is out of town and will fix it as soon as he can.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    (#1196485) called back and gave the okay on the massage.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day everyone!!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    July 1st, 2008 at 12:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Well folks, we didn’t make our June forecast. I’m sure that we’re all pretty bummed about that. I have been very carefully analyzing why we didn’t make it and I think it has mainly to do with the poor weather. Which, despite my wishes, remains out of my control. Both Elements and Bird Rock came in under expectations even though our advanced bookings were really high. What does this mean? Unfortunately for you it means no June bonus. For us, it just means we still can’t afford to pay all those darned bill collectors. BUT, it doesn’t mean we need to give up hope. Quite the contrary. I really do think that it was the weather and not the ecomony (which depsite my children’s wishes, also remains out of my control). So, let’s just all keep those beautiful smiles flashing and dazzle our guests, future, current and past, with our wonderful hospitality. Any questions, comments, ideas or dreams, just let me know. Happy July!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Guys,\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING\r\n    Please tell Raquel or Regino that the Nordstom’s group will be putting all of their stuff in room 314. They will have a late check out around 1:00pm like last time, this way they can check out of all the other rooms on time.\r\n\r\n    ISSUE\r\n    Room 106 had a clogged up sink. I tried my best to un clog it but it needed real help. Seth came in at 9:30 pm but his card deactivated, THANKFULLY Morgan was upstairs and could come to set it. Then Seth went on to fix the sink. :) It is nice to have employees that try to help as much as they can.\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Thank you for introducing me to your very cool teacher friend, I hope you all have a wonderful visit while she is up!\r\n\r\n    See you at 3:00\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 5:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Diana and Marina have bikes 6 and 10.\r\n    I am just writing it here because I am not sure of where else we are supposed to write it. Do we have some sort of system?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN-\r\n    This guy wanted to talk to you. Please call him back. His rez. # is 1094836.\r\n\r\n    STEPHAN-\r\n    There was a reservation made for a man today and I think I heard you talking to him. His rez. # is 1200511 and when he came to check in, there was no reservation under his name and I checked todays check ins for any name close to his name and there was nothing. I am assuming that there was a misspelling in his name and it was made for the wrong date as well, but maybe it just didn’t get processed. I’m not sure. If you recognize it maybe you would remember if you made it for a different date. Let me know if you have any questions about this.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    June 30th, 2008 at 12:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Go ahead, call me a party-pooper. Let’s just get that out before you read any further.\r\n\r\n    Now here’s why: last year Laura and I were MORTIFIED to find a bunch of ELEMENTS chairs spread out along Spring on the Fourth of July with signs saying “reserved for ELEMENTS staff,” and occupied by the backsides of many ELEMENTS staffers and their friends and family paying no heed to the countless paying guests squished on the sidewalk behind them.\r\n\r\n    No, no, no, no. How many millions of ways can I say NO!? Is there anyone who does not get this? Please spread the chairs out again this year, but reserve them for ELEMENTS GUESTS. Remember, the folks who bring you wonderful things like…paychecks? If you want a reserved seat for the fourth, bring your own chair and stake it out down the road. This year the ELEMENTS stoop is 100% about customer service. No exceptions, and Laura and I will be checking.\r\n\r\n    Now you can call me something even worse than a party-pooper, if you want. If anyone can’t think of at least one reason why the ELEMENTS STAFF chairs sent such a bad message to me, Laura and our guests, please see me or Laura. ‘Nuff said???\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 5:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Sunday\r\n    Dave and I just got back from cruising along the West Side (sorry guys), it was so beautiful, and nice and cool. We are so lucky to live in such a wonderful paradise.\r\n    Bikes\r\n    This morning I asked Khaili to find out where all our beach cruisers are, I know that our university students have 2 of them, and one is out of service, but when I was at the hotel bright and early this am, i counted only 12. REMEMBER we have to make sure EVERY night, that they are all accounted for. Khaili please make sure that this was completed today so that we know where they all are, I told Emilija today that if she could just make sure that when they take the bikes for the night to ALWAYS tell the front desk what number, and also they should always be the older ones. :)\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    I told the girls this morning that they should get an umbrella and stand from maintenance to put up by the bar in the coffee shop, it will give them some direct sun relief and help make the counter not so hot. Morgan can you make sure this happened. Thanks\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 4:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Good news: The wedding ring was found! The family was really nice and thrilled that they found it. I had a good time talking with them.\r\n\r\n    Lilly and I think that there should be a small recycling bin next to the trash can because those cups are recyclable. We could also put some sort of sign that asked everyone to please recycle.\r\n\r\n    Alright, that is all for now.\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 12:26 pm\r\n\r\n    Request for Adam: new Coldplay cd on the playlist…pleease!?!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 12:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Gio,\r\n    I entered all the credit cards yesterday. Let’s go over that later today, if you aren’t melted by then.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 29th, 2008 at 8:28 am\r\n\r\n    Hi… hello…Heya…\r\n    Well its 8.30am, and Natalia and I are dying of heat stroke! Kidding. But, WOW, I cant believe that its this hot this early in the morning. We are switching turns to sit in the shade until the sun gets a little higher in the sky.\r\n    I’m not posting anything special, just felt that I haven’t blogged in a really long while. Oh yes…. one thing! I was supposed to enter the Credit card into the computer from Zia, but they were not in the safe. Does anyone know where they went?\r\n    Well this is my friday, see all you in a few days with a fresh start on a new week! Bye~\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:58 pm\r\n\r\n    p.s. Thanks Adam.\r\n    haha\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Wooohoo! Looks like it is on!\r\n    Ready, Lilly? :D\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Adam! I love that you like our idea!! I’m sure Khai and I would be more than willing to get all the necessary stuff and put it together and then give it to you…how exciting!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 8:01 pm\r\n\r\n    I really like the idea of a “meet the staff” page at ELEMENTS. If someone will coordinate, take and/or collect and email to me staff pictures I will create such a page…. Nice thinking guys….!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 5:34 pm\r\n\r\n    For me too, please!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 5:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Only if a picture of Brad Pitt can be used for my section.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 4:51 pm\r\n\r\n    PROPOSITION:\r\n    Priscilla, Lilly and I were thinking that we should have a meet the staff section on our website. It sounds kinda fun, doesn’t it? You know, with a picture and your interests, etc.\r\n\r\n    What do you guys think?\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    ..I’m not done yet. There was one other thing..\r\n\r\n    The latch to the pool house gate is broken. But not for long! We took the latch off all together so that guest’s could get in to our wonderful Cafe Zia and hang out on the patio in the sun. Maintenance report is written and Seth will work his magic next time hes in.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\n    It’s good to be back.\r\n\r\n    Well, the mornings been busy with lots of guests enjoying the summer weather. There are a few things though that I would like to check on:\r\n\r\n    Room 332- the handle to the bathtub was loose, and then fell off when i went to check it! Regino went in to check it right away. Is it fixed? Great.\r\n\r\n    Have you ever heard of Quail Croft Goat Cheese?? It’s local and very yummy. If you would like to visit this local farm, you will find it at 2553 A Cattle Point Rd. :)\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the Fresh Breath Emporium Steffi!!! Now we all can show off out pearly whites and beautiful smiles..\r\n\r\n    See you tomorrow!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    HELLO SUN!\r\n    Nice weather today. It was awesome.\r\n    There was a not-so-awesome incident today, however. The guests in 312 lost a wedding ring, and they were sure it was left in there. We searched very thoroughly but nothing came up. If it is found, their reservation number is 986882.\r\n    Priscilla and I took a field trip down to the Hideaway. I like it. If you just want a quite spot, Priscilla and I thought it was perfect, as quirky as it may be :)\r\n    Alright… I think that is all.\r\n    See you tomorrow.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 28th, 2008 at 2:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Check out Steffi’s FRESH MOUTH EMPORIUM for the front desk staff. Enjoy luscious organic gum and assorted organic mints and have breath fresh as a dewy Spring morning in a meadow. Not only those of us who still pray to the tobacco gods (you know Laura’s heart hurts every time you smoke!), now everybody can enjoy fresh breath when talking to our guests. And remember: you can “hear” on the phone not only when you smile but also that you have fresh breath. Eat ‘em up!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 10:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Me again.\r\n    Room 203\r\n    The bathtub doesn’t drain. Guest is stay-over and wants to stay next to his friends. Please make sure Regino or Seth has a look at that tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Morgan for getting the boss ladies matching post-its, I especially like the one which says: Someday, Somehow. You are a sweety.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 7:33 pm\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    I put up the schedule for 7-7 to 7-20. Due to day-off requests we are all working all kind of shifts on all kind of days, yeah, summer! So please look closely. Cafe Zia will stay staffed with just 1 person, however, I made sure on the weekends to have either Gio or Lilly work the front desk, so either one of them can jump out there and help the coffee goddesses. You guys rock, keep up the good work!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 27th, 2008 at 4:33 pm\r\n\r\n    NEED TO LAUGH?\r\n    I saw such a good movie last night, I laughed out loud. It’s called: “The Darwin Awards”. The Darwin Awards do really exist and are awarded to people who die in really really stupid ways, for taking themselves out of the gene pool. I know, a tad tasteless. In the movie our hero is a total nerd, who tries to find a profile for those guys (it’s guys, always) who die in really really stupid ways, in order to get a job with an insurance company. He finds that after all he may not be so different than them, trying to find meaning, trying to accomplish something….It’s hilarious.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 10:30 pm\r\n\r\n    INVOICE\r\n    there is an invoice on the back desk that needs to be signed when the guest leaves, and she will also need a copy. The printer had a major paper jam when she checked in.\r\n\r\n    LAMINATING SHEETS?\r\n    Laura I saw the paper you left for me to laminate but I couldn’t find any laminating sheets. Are we out?\r\n\r\n    Had a blast working with Khaili. See ya! I am off for the next couple of days (well sorta)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    San Juan Safaris\r\n    Any child under 2 years of age must stay with an adult in the cabin at all times, there is big windows on the whale watch boat so you will be able to see, or you can trade off with another adult. Please make sure ALL guests know this prior to booking a trip.\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 3:39 pm\r\n\r\n    REMINDER:\r\n    Okay, we had a slight mishap with the clipper faxes. We have to make sure that they are faxed back after we receive and process them. Also, make sure you double check the dates. Today, I found a couple of reservations that were booked for july 8th for the clipper. I found the fax from them at the fax read: 02 July 08.\r\n    I can see how this would get confusing, but we really need to make sure that we get these right.\r\n\r\n    Did everyone notice the severe weather alert?\r\n    “SOME SPOTS MAY FLIRT WITH RECORD HIGH\r\n    TEMPERATURES…” Thank you, accuweather :D\r\n\r\n    “\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT\r\n    1)Print out the house keeping report for the correct day (today)\r\n    2) Make sure you printed the correct day (today)\r\n    3) Double check all pages are printed and submitted to R & R (a total of 7 pages)\r\n    4) Repeat steps 1 through 3\r\n    5) Give report to R & R and together repeat steps 1 through 3\r\n    I’m trying to be funny, but really, we need to get a handle on this. Please pay attention.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Lavendera Spa is closed on the 4th of July, For those guests that would like spa services please call spa d bune at 370-5027, they are going to be open to us only. spa d bune does not need our vouchers with it, they will charge the guests there and we will facilitate in making the appointment and directing our guests where they are located. If someone inquires about spa services on day of the 4th we will have an on call number to call. I will post that next week. But for spa reservations prior to the 4th for the day of the 4th call spa d bune directly.\r\n    Thanks so much.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 10:29 pm\r\n\r\n    SHUTTLE:\r\n    Can you please arrange a shuttle for a party of five down to the ferry? they will come at 10:00am the rez # 1133723(no actual notes in their file, just so you know the name)\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    Was ready today so I picked it up form Printonyx today. Yay me!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    about the cups there are paper cups in the back as well as the small plastic cups like we used to have for water, not sure what the situation is on the corn starch cups for water.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 6:38 pm\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP\r\n    A system is only as good as the people using it. Yup, I know, pretty deep, ain’t it?\r\n    So: check, respond to, and file emails daily. People add on services, cancel, have questions, please respond to them, it is part of your job and needs to happen in a timely manner.\r\n    Check “new bookings” section in WRP constantly. Print out online reservations and process. And here is a biggy: respond to alarms and afterwards: turn them off. Elena and I started our shift with something ridiculous like 12 alarms. Half of them had been dealt with, it turned out.\r\n    Also: don’t forget to take the garbage and recycling out. Morgan put a spiffy closing check list on the back of our closing sign. Please make sure you do all those things before leaving.\r\n    Team work, baby! Don’t ask what your coworkers can do for you, ask what you can do for your coworkers. It’s summer. We can do this. Pay attention and have fun!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Stefan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 3:37 pm\r\n\r\n    I got a call from the SPA today they wanted to let us know that they will be closed on the 4th of July. So if anybody wants to book something for the 4th tell them that the SPA will not be working. Thanks\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2008 at 9:05 am\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    214 & 215 are on hold for July 3, 4, and 5. Release only if you need to.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 11:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh, yeah. Susan Jackson returned a call for Morgan conf. # 1168023\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 11:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    There were three no shows tonight..all part of the Century Tel group. I printed out their invoices and left them on the back desk in case they show up.\r\n\r\n    I’ve got a three day weekend, see you all on Saturday morning :)\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 24th, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    #214345015 Expedia Reservation…please call Expedia tomorrow immediately! We do NOT have this room available and I couldn’t get through to them earlier because I was on hold for like 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n    The box in the back w/ all the shower baskets…I called Home Depot today. They will be emailing Laura a pre-paid postage thing in the next few days.\r\n\r\n    Also…their are still a couple boxes that need to be taken out to storage. (Old receipts, housekeeping reports, etc.)\r\n\r\n    That’s about it….goodnight!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 11:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone!\r\n\r\n    All guests in, including two walkins.\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n\r\n    There are receipts on the back desk from the coffee shop. I didn’t know whether they had been/needed to be entered into the computer.\r\n\r\n    see you all tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 9:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    First things first-\r\n    Mo: There was an e-mail left tonight about a spa request. The spa was closed when we got that email so if you could follow up on that, that would be awesome.\r\n    Okay, I think that is it.\r\n    Good luck on your “three day weekend” Morgan.\r\n\r\n    See you all on.. thurday. :)\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 10:48 am\r\n\r\n    Spa\r\n    When we cannot use Lavendera for appointments, please call spa d bune,370-5027 but when we use spa d bune remember that we do not do the voucher system, the guest will pay spa d bune directly. But we will set up the appointment as usual. make sure to show the guest where the spa is.\r\n    #332\r\n    Morgan already said it, Island Glass came as soon as I called today, and WOW it was 2 hours later and they had it totally fixed. That is service.\r\n    Vouchers or Direct Bills\r\n    Like Mr. Morgan said DONT process payment on any reservations paying with a voucher or a direct bill, I will do that when I receive payment. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 23rd, 2008 at 10:38 am\r\n\r\n    332\r\n    Is open for business. Yay for Island Glass.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    Just a reminder to y’all. Do not process payment at check-in for Vic. Clip. reservations. They do not need to be processed as cash, voucher, or gift cert. Just leave them be. When you check them out on their departure date it should give you a warning box that says that the amount was added to Victoria Clippers direct bill account. If it doesn’t, that means that whomever made the reservation forgot to add it to their Corporate Account. Just add it then re-check them out. Should work then. Cindy deals with the bills for those rooms. If you process the payment then we have to go back and refund everything to make it work. THANKS!!! ^_^\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 5:52 pm\r\n\r\n    YUMMY coffee, the girls are pro’s, as far as the charges go out at the coffee shop, if someone wants to charge an item from the coffee shop on to their room, make sure that you have the guests sign a charge slip, put their room number and print their name, these slips will go in the night drop bag with the daily paper work from Cafe Zia, before you put them in the bag please add them to the rooms and then put a check and your initials to indicate it has been done.\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Great job on your fast, I am proud of you.. Waiting to hear how it goes.\r\n    Laura\r\n    She will be out of the office for the first few days this week, please let people calling know, and ask if I can help them of if they would like her voicemail\r\n    Bike #20\r\n    We will keep this bike for spare parts, it will be kept in the maintenance shop\r\n    Cafe Zia\r\n    I had the girls put a brochure rack out on the counter with some maps, that way our groovey little coffee makers can play concerige also.\r\n    Room 332\r\n    I will update you on the eta of the window on Monday.\r\n    Happy Sunday night.. :D\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 2:47 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA\r\n    Did I mention how proud I am of Gio and Natalia? These girls rock!\r\n    Couple of things: when we check in guests and show them on the property map where the pool, spa, laundry room is, please point out Cafe Zia and mention that it is open from 7AM to 3PM daily.\r\n    Credit card sales: when guests want to pay with a credit card at Zia, the girls will use the manual credit card machine. One of us needs to input those sales into WRP every day after Zia closes (Gio will do this mostly). Go to house accounts to do this.\r\n    Room charge: when guests want to add a coffee drink to their room, Gio will add the charge to their room into WRP on her laptop. When Gio is not working or her computer isn’t, the front desk will get a call from cafe Zia, saying which amount to add to which room.\r\n    This is all a work in progress, so bear with us and tell us your ideas.\r\n\r\n    FUN FACT\r\n    When you eat artichokes and then have a sip of beer, the beer tastes like 7up. Why?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN:\r\n    We need a tall person to get some 8oz paper cups for the lobby and the coffee shop. Are you up for the job?\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 10:43 am\r\n\r\n    If the opening person could make the drip for Gio, that would be great. They are super busy in the morning and would like it is we could help them out a little :)\r\n\r\n    Also, there was an extra brochure holder in the back office, and the coffee shop needed a place to put some island maps so we brought it out there. I didn’t think it had much use sitting there empty. Just letting everyone know in case they need it.\r\n\r\n    Its been a pretty exciting morning, lots to do.\r\n    Have a great day everyone!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 9:22 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan, sounds like a little bit of a rough night. Unusual story though.. anyways, just thought i would let you know that i called Davidson about the room change. i left a message letting him know and told him if he had any questions he could give us a call.\r\n\r\n    :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 22nd, 2008 at 8:50 am\r\n\r\n    Can we add Cafe Zia into the extra charges scroll bar for a room??\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2008 at 9:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Smooth sailing with my trusty sidekick Morgan tonight. Nice, happy guests.\r\n\r\n    A guest left a message asking for more towels and if a phone call on a phone card from the room would cost her. She didn’t leave her name or number or room. Just so you know.\r\n\r\n    Also: Morgan was trying to find who made the call from which room and somebody had turned off the CMS & winlink program on the back desk computer. Those two programs need to be on at all times. They track the long distance calls from the rooms.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    please check #1187080, these guests are here but have a reservation fully paid for July. On purpose, accident? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    Happy solstice everybody!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 21st, 2008 at 3:41 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERT NO SHOWS\r\n    When making a reservation with a gift cert. PLEASE make sure you get the gift certificate number. More often than not the Gift Cert. number is already used to make a pseudo-reservation on WRP. Just use the info in WRP to make a reservation that way we have the GC number. We had a no show on the Wind House last night. Res #1180029. Our cancellation policy still applies to GC reservations. If they make a reservation, and we hold that room on their GC. Should they “no show” on us we will void their GC. That’s it.\r\n    DAY SPA\r\n    Lavendera will hopefully have some more brochures available on Monday so we can get some more then for the lobby. Any thought on having a nice full-page list in the room folders?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 10:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LOBBY LIGHTS\r\n    Well the track lights above the lobby are stuck on permanent “mood lighting.” I think the ballast, transformer, or whatever handles that thing is finally going bad. Can we have Dave look at it? It’s a little dark in here without them at full power.\r\n    BIKE(s)\r\n    Bike number 20 rear wheel is bent. We need to take it over to Island Bicycles to have it repaired. I hope they can just re-true it or else it’ll cost us a new rim. Booooo.\r\n    WEDDING GUESTS\r\n    Well as you may have notices we are almost sold out for Saturday. A lot of those folks are with a rather largish wedding. That means that there will usually be a run on irons and ironing boards. if it looks like everyone and their bridesmaid needs one here are some tips. Refer people to the full-sized ironing board and steam iron in the guest laundry room. Ask guests to call you when they are finished so we can have housekeeping pick it up and take it to another guest. Just a thought. Also a big concern with wedding guests are the folks who are trying to get into their room extra early to get ready. Because we are so full please try to avoid moving rooms around. There is too much of an opportunity for reservations to me messed up or wrong room keys given out. Good luck morning folk.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s my 2 cents.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing:\r\n    We had a mishap with the housekeeping report today. Whoever prints out the housekeeping reports for Raquel or Regino, please check the “page 1 of (insert total number of pages here)” at the bottom of the first page, and count to make sure that all of those pages are there.\r\n    Thanks guys.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA:\r\n\r\n    It is really important that you tell Raquel or Regino that 308 needs to be cleaned as soon as the housekeeping staff gets here. Read the remarks in res. # 1418 for details.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n\r\n    See you at nine.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 7:06 pm\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well folks we are almost sold out for Saturday. WOOHOO!!! I have put rooms 304 and 335 on Emergency Hold. Please do not forget to release them if everything is looking good.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 20th, 2008 at 11:26 am\r\n\r\n    Ok…so I organized the back cabinet with all the brochures, so hopefully it will be a little easier to find what we are looking for. Also…we are running low on a few brochures for San Juan Safaris, M & W, Susie’s, etc. So I called all the places that we need brochures from and they will hopefully be bringing them by in the next few days.\r\n\r\n    Also! Alarms…they can be kind of confusing when it just says “follow-up” but there are no notes in the reservation…what am I following up on?\r\n\r\n    Airplane poster in the lobby….we don’t sell them anymore as most of you probably know. They can be found on linneadesigns.com\r\n\r\n    Western Prince has tons of space on their 2pm whale watch today…and J-Pod is back so whale sightings are almost a guarantee. Western Prince also wants us to know that their set summer schedule will be a 2pm everyday, with a 10am cruise on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\r\n\r\n    That’s pretty much it…the phones have been ringing like crazy this morning!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 10:02 pm\r\n\r\n    The lady in rm 323 wants to know exactly were we got the poster that is framed in our lobby, I tried to find it be the artist name but I couldn’t find that exact print. She will be in, in the morning if someone could have that info handy.\r\n\r\n    Please Call SJO in the am and add an extra adult to for rez # 1153452? Thank you.\r\n\r\n    It was a nice quiet evening.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 7:49 pm\r\n\r\n    Cool, Khaili, thank you!\r\n\r\n    And since Gio forgot to brag, I have to: Gio, I’m so proud of you! Gio went to local businesses and gave out coupons for Zia, got us orders from all kinds of people, because we use organic milk and Gio has a reputation as the espresso queen on the island. Yeah!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone!\r\n    I feel like it is October… sun, where are you? :(\r\n    Okay, so I have a couple of things to tell you all–\r\n\r\n    The first is a reminder that the summer ferry schedule is in effect on the 22nd. YAY! Summer is almost here!\r\n\r\n    The second is that I made up a waiting list for the people who request a room that isn’t available when they make their reservations. It is an excel document and it is in the “waiting list” folder. Filling it out is pretty much self explanatory.\r\n    Things to remember about this waiting list:\r\n    -Always check the waiting list after a cancellation is made, to see if someone requested that room for that time.\r\n    -It is a first come first serve deal, so before you let the customer know about the opening, make sure they were the FIRST ones to request that type of room.\r\n\r\n    Have a great night, everyone-\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    TEST RESERVATIONS\r\n    We got several TEST reservations the last couple of days. They originate from from Reach Local, a marketing company cooperating with Blizzard. I called and asked them what up. They said to simply cancel those test reservations.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 19th, 2008 at 12:52 pm\r\n\r\n    MAP PAPER\r\n    I ordered a case of paper with the property map on the back from Printonyx. Should be ready for pick up in a week.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 10:36 pm\r\n\r\n    BACKDOOR KITCHEN VOUCHERS\r\n    I made a voucher log and put our very first entry in it, but we do not have anymore of those pocket dividers here so for now the sheets are in the front pocket of the voucher folder. I know we have lots of extra at BR so I will bring some up with me when I come in tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    How weird to be here at ELEMENTS it feels like its been forever and like I should be doing dishes or breakfast prep or… something.\r\n\r\n    We got an online rez. (1183530) requesting that we add a whale watch tour to the guests stay because she wants to join her sister who is supposed to have already had a trip booked for the 21st with San Juan excursions at 1:00pm, but when I looked up the sisters rez (1181056) there was nothing noted about whale watching anywhere. I called San Juan excursions and left a message to check that nothing was booked and then not noted. If they call back and nothing has been booked please make sure that it does get booked. This is kind of a rambling blog so ask me if you have any questions, in any case I will be in at 3:00\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 8:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Evening ALL:)\r\n    Thanks everyone for attending the customer service staff meeting today, it is great to be able to talk with you all and express what we as managers feel are our strong points and weak points and to know that you all are able to take it and process it as needed. If you have any imput I would love to hear it.\r\n    BOXES\r\n    When you put boxes in the recycle bin please break them down, if you don’t it fills up the recycle bin really fast.\r\n    Parking Bumpers\r\n    WOW, the housekeeping staff went to town and painted all the curbs, they look fantastic, Thanks everyone..\r\n    FISH\r\n    Did you see the cute little fish in the pool tonight? I think their names were Zoe and Mia, they were doing all kinds of tricks lead by their trainer Khaili\r\n    Happy Wednesday EVE..\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 18th, 2008 at 10:33 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone-\r\n    Just letting you all know that some of the members from the Elements Relay For Life team may be stopping by to drop off some paper work for me. If they do, could you please just put those in my box. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\n    Also, if Backdoor Kitchen e-mails us their logo, it is for the dining vouchers. There is a voucher already made in publisher, so if you get that e-mail, please copy and paste it into the voucher. If this doesn’t make sense (very possible) just ask me.\r\n\r\n    One more thing… Seth put the new bikes out today. If someone wants to use them, make sure that they know that the seats are not adjustable yet. The adjustable seat clasps aren’t here yet.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Khaili :)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 17th, 2008 at 10:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n\r\n    The Pacific Lutheran elderly group has been told that they have 12:00 check outs, please let Housekeeping know. They also will be bringing their bags into the office to be stored, we are then suppose to load their bags into the van and take the luggage for the 18 people down to the clipper for them. Hopefully those people will find their own way down.\r\n\r\n    I also confirmed a webervation, and caught that they were looking for a massage. Since the reservation is for 6/22 lets try and get it booked right away! it may be a side by side.. “lets make it double”\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n\r\n    There was a phone message for you, look up #210275808 and read the remarks.\r\n\r\n    Well, my nights done. See you all at the staff meeting tomorrow!\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 16th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi\r\n\r\n    Phones were ringing off the hook tonight.\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    -Remember the Romance package\r\n    -Room 115 is a stay over, they bought another room so they could hang out all day until their ferry home.\r\n\r\n    STEFFI\r\n    Room #112 needs a new room binding\r\n\r\n    Yikes! I found something special in the back room and left him on the back desk for everyone to see.\r\n\r\n    Hope all the newbies have fun on the field trip.\r\n\r\n    See you at 3:00\r\n\r\n    Priscilla\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino, Thank you for digging through the trash to find the clipper ladies misplaced Clipper tickets. That was amazing!!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 12:56 pm\r\n\r\n    David Waldron from the Hideaway called today, he has some friends that will stay in the Hideaway on Saturday the 21st, I marked the room as closed for that day.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 15th, 2008 at 11:38 am\r\n\r\n    Ok so we had a ton of bags this morning…and probably more to come throughout the afternoon. And that back room is SOOO full. Can we make a plan to clean that room this week? It is so messy and there is barely any room for bags…let’s try to make a bit more space for the bags so Cindy and Laura can actually get into their office…haha.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    NO SHOW\r\n    #31923 was a not show last night. She had moved her reservation to today because of our pool closure in April. I bet she just blew it off because we were letting everyone cancel with no penalty at the time. If she still hasn’t shown by morning just cancel the reservation and let her go without further charges. Thanks!\r\n    OTHER INFO\r\n    - Just warning you that you will probably have a whole mess of folk looking for bikes in the morning. I had a lot of inquiries. One guy has already filled out the paperwork and will be in to drop off his card and take a bike.\r\n    - Don’t anyone order more coffee for a bit. We have a bag in the fridge that NEEDS to be used up. Thanks!!\r\n    Seez you all later!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 8:47 pm\r\n\r\n    School is out! It seems so surreal. It hasn’t quite hit me yet.\r\n    PRISCILLA AND LILLY\r\n    Tomorrow I will be in at 2:30 instead of 1. Just a little heads up.\r\n    Not much else to say… I am usually so talkative :D\r\n    See you tomorrow\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    I’m just going through upcoming reservations and noticed not enough info on renting the conference center. We’ll need to know:\r\n    1) what time of the day the guests will need the conference center\r\n    2) what the occasion is\r\n    3) contact information for host, full address, phone number\r\n    4) is there no charge because we donated it or did one of us not put a price in?\r\n    5) make alarm for a couple of days prior if there are room set up requirements, so Raquel can have a heads up.\r\n    Morgan made sure we have a functioning conference center key in the key cabinet on back desk.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 6:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I will telecommute tomorrow (as in: stay home). Please call me at home with any issues.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 5:26 pm\r\n\r\n    YEAH CAFE ZIA NOW OPEN\r\n    Gio, Natalia, you did great! Thank you so much for making it all happen, Gio.\r\n    Bosspeople: what kind of sign do we want? Morgan researched the city code for signs. We could hang a sign from a pole extending from our E sign (highly visible). Or we could have a sandwich board, but only on our property, not on the sidewalk (plus with all the cars parked there, nobody would see it driving by).\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 14th, 2008 at 4:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Will someone make sure Gio gets the message tomorrow that Angie called her back about baked goods. The message is on the back bulletin board. Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 11:02 pm\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-IN\r\n    #1176229. She’ll be by in the morning for assistance with booking massages and dinner reservations. So please do the voodoo that you do.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 7:37 pm\r\n\r\n    FD UNIFORMS\r\n    It’s on, Baby! Starting tomorrow we will all wear: chocolate brown bottoms & blue E shirts. No other colored shirts, no vests, sweaters and what nots (Cindy will provide us with plain white long sleeved shirts to put under the blue if it’s cold), no flip flops, no unbrown pants, no supershort skirts and shorts(knee length please). Ladies: strap em in, if you know what I mean. If you show your gorgeous legs, shave them.\r\n    Not following the dress code may result in drowning your puppy, telling your boyfriend that you have an affair, having your head shaved or other punishment we see fit.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 2:51 pm\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETING STAFF MEETING STAFF MEETING\r\n    Yeah! Wednesday, 6/18, 2 PM at ELEMENTS. This is a mandatory meeting. Khaili & Lilly will work our front desks. Gio, Stefan & Lina will be here already. Elena & Tory, please come an hour early to work. Priscilla & Morgan, please come. Kaitlyn is excused.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    I’ll need a way to get a hold of you. Is your cell working again, do you have a home number?\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY 6/17\r\n    Morgan will take our newest exchange students off island. Lilly will work the front desk at E and will not be training at BR that day.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 1:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everybody :)\r\n    I must let you know something. Western Prince just called. They’ll have an additional WW cruise every Sunday 4pm :)\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 13th, 2008 at 9:41 am\r\n\r\n    #1077016 finally got a hold of our no-show. He said that he canceled months ago…does anyone recall?? Because we have no record of him canceling, but he does have a second reservation in July…maybe it was just a mix-up.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2008 at 11:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Good Morning Lilly!\r\n    Reservation#1077016 was a no show this evening. Could you please follow up on this please. They have a massage scheduled for 8/13/08 at 345pm. Invoices and voucher is on back desk. Thanks\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 12th, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you so much Steffi for finding that reservation! I called him this morning to verify the date and I have yet to hear back, so I will try again before I leave today, but hopefully we will hear from him soon.\r\n\r\n    Also, to everyone..there are a lot of bookings that have been left in the “new bookings” section and have not been confirmed yet because of credit card problems, we have gotten a hold of those who’s credit cards are not working so we will be trying to confirm those reservations asap…we are just waiting to hear back from people.\r\n\r\n    A pretty busy morning…lots of phone calls and online reservation. We had a little scramble earlier when we couldn’t get the Visitors Bureau ladies into the Orca Room because our key is expired. So we had Morgan make us a new key because none of us are a high enough level to make that key…but they ended up just having their meeting out by the pool patio and they were more than happy to just be outside.\r\n\r\n    That’s the only major things I can think of…Gio is making us some pretty delicious coffee…thanks girl!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 8:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LILLY\r\n    #1172754. I found his 2nd reservation: #1157303, it was made for July. I don’t want to upset the guest any more by calling super late. Please call him, first thing tomorrow, verify the month of his stay and cancel the respective second reservation (have Cindy show you how to apply the payment he already made to the rightful reservation). And please be super nice.\r\n    EVERYBODY: always, always, always read back the reservation details to the guest. It is so easy to get the day, month or even year wrong in WRP.\r\n    Also: when you search for a guest and spell the name just a little different, WRP will not list the reservation. It’s a bit of a flaw. What I do is: search by last name (that’s what I did in his case, nobody misspells that)or by the first couple of letters: WEH as opposed to WEHNER.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 6:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a friendly little fyi. Please be sure to suppress prices for all Victoria Clipper reservations. I had a checkin today that was not suppressed. This was already mentioned in the blog earlier I just thought I would remind everyone.\r\n\r\n    Also Ralph the flower guy called this afternoon and let us know that he will not be in this week. So does this mean we need to make different flower “arrangements” this week with someone else until then?\r\n\r\n    Thank you Cindy for the chat today. I will be sure to slow down and focus on guests that are checking in for now on! I don’t know how that could have happened. I love everybody!\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    PS…one more thing. 1172754..called today could not find the reservation anywhere. He was super upset so I remade the reservation and he was going to check his debit card online, to make sure we didn’t already charge him for his first “reservation.” He said he will email us with the go-ahead to charge the 10%…hopefully we will hear from him soon.\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 3:17 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m back! So there were a few things this morning that I thought were important to fill everyone in on.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, this guy Henri with the group that just came in, he said he talked to you about his lost camera. I told him we would call him with any information we got about the camera. His number is 206-420-9429, he was in room 336…everyone keep your eyes out for a camera!\r\n\r\n    Ok second, tomorrow we need a van ride to the airport at 4:30. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\n    Also, I refunded 986158…she was uncomfortable about the outdoor entrances…she said we don’t have that on our website anywhere. Should that be something we put up??\r\n\r\n    I think that’s about it…I am so happy to be back!! :D\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 11th, 2008 at 9:21 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning:)\r\n    Welcome Natailya and Lilly… Lilly is working at ELEMENTS today, and then is coming to Bird Rock to train, Gio is training a day early with Natailya in the coffee shop..

I’m back and refreshed. I have a food handlers card that is good for two more years. I will get a copy from Health Dept today! Yah! All the goody treats came in! The Cafe Zia is on the….High Five! This is just a short lil’ brief for now.\r\n    Welcome Natalia! CHAO!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 10th, 2008 at 7:33 am\r\n\r\n    Is this really June? Snow in the passes, downed trees and power outages?? The good news is better weather is on the way!\r\n\r\n    Hey Priscilla, remember to use guest reservation numbers not names…I edited your last post. Thanks.\r\n    priscilla Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2008 at 10:53 pm\r\n\r\n    few things tonight.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n\r\n    1169325 never called back about the kayaking tours. Also, thanks for the help with the card machine. I was very scared when i got several encoding errors in a row…but then morgan saved the day when he realized it just needed a good ole’ cleaning and showed me where the cleaning cards were. thank you!\r\n\r\n    Also, for tomorrow remember West Marine is coming in…\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n\r\n    Ken Condray called back about the bicycle group, he said he will be in touch with you soon.\r\n\r\n    other than that fairly slow, three walk ins though. YAY!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 9th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    FSA\r\n    A great load of cookies, candy, chips and frozen treats arrived from FSA today. The non-freezer foodstuffs are in the corner of the Cedar room. The frozen stuff was split between the two cafe freezers and my freezer. The only reason I had to split things up was because I kept the treats in their boxes. I didn’t know if there were specific plans for them so I didn’t want to mess with it. Don’t worry I won’t eat the ice cream cups that are in my freezer. I don’t like raspberry. bleh!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Event calendar for August done!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 7:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Nothing too exciting today. Phones were DEAD all day, until Steffi got here… :)\r\n    The sink the the Wind Place’s small bathroom appeared to be sealed shut, until Morgan went over and figured it out (when he was off duty.) Thank you, Morgan.\r\n    I only have five more days of school left(!!!) so I will get to work my first full week soon.\r\n    Hope everyone has a great week-\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 6:39 pm\r\n\r\n    NATALIYA\r\n    Missed her Kenmore air flight. I booked her a room at the Hilton. She will be on the 12.30 Kenmore air flight tomorrow (arriving FH airport at 1.05). We’ll need to reimburse her for the cab ride from the Hilton to Boing Filed (as per Laura). On my desk find a manila folder with schedule, phone list and stuff for her.\r\n    Welcome Nataliya! I’ll meet you on Thursday!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 5:14 pm\r\n\r\n    110 & 111\r\n    Fuse blew in both rooms (#2) and kept blowing, sparks flying out of the outlet on the lower right in 110, where the reading lamp is plugged in. I put guests in other rooms and blocked rooms out for 3 days (wrote MR), please have somebody (Dave?) have a looksy and let HK know to clean the rooms before releasing them.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please go to the bank and get small bills in the next couple of days. Dankeschoen!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 3:58 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO\r\n    Please plan on taking the food handler’s class on June 19, 9AM at the Mullis fire station, together with Lina,Stefan & Natalia. We’ll pay for it. Thank you!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 8th, 2008 at 11:33 am\r\n\r\n    NOISE COMPLAINTS\r\n    Cindy please read the notes for reservations #1167227 & #1069106. I personally don’t think these rooms should be comp’d seeing as they made so much trouble for paying guests. But what do I know…\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    I think the timer controller for the is to blame for the bubbles not turning off. When I flipped the breaker on this morning the jets immediately turned on. I have decided to leave the jets off for the day or until Dave can take a look at the thing.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Well something is up with the hot tub’s bubbles. The darn thing won’t turn off. You can press the button as many times as you want but once they’re going, there’s no stopping them. After letting them run all day I finally just flipped the breaker switch to shut them off for the night. I talked to Dave and he knows that we may have to have him come by on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 1:32 pm\r\n\r\n    ROOM SERVICE\r\n    had actually 2 last night. The guests loved the food, but Morgan & I scrambled with dishes & silverware. Raquel will get some more matching dishes & silverware. She will put them up on the shelves in the luggage room. Please don’t use those dishes (and especially the silverware) for your personal lunches. Gracias.\r\n\r\n    PET BLANKETS\r\n    Raquel will put some more pet blankets in our bathroom. If you ever run out, they are in the laundry room, right above the door (not the ones on your left, these are the people blankets)\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 12:15 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S. There is a TON of great Mexican food left over from the party last night. It is in the coffee shop’s fridge. Help yourself!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    June 7th, 2008 at 12:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Pretend that I am Cindy– :)\r\n\r\n    If one of the guests runs away with a bike, don’t make a big deal about it. Next time they are in the office, ask them nicely to please come check in with the office next time.\r\n\r\n    Morgan-\r\n    Could you please order some more of the seat adjustment things (great explanation, I know) for the beach cruisers? I’m not sure how many. Cindy will know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CLIPPER\r\n    Cindy, I noticed that the clipper now sends us faxes with 8 room allocations daily. That is not how I understood the new arrangement you made with them. I put the faxes in your inbox. Can you clarify this for us, please?\r\n    Also: everybody, please make sure that you suppress the pricing on clipper invoices. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    We had our first room service today. BDK now has one of our yellow heating bags. They also printed the menus for Bird Rock. I put them in your box, Laura.\r\n\r\n    SJ OUTFITTERS\r\n    has a whale watch tomorrow at 1 PM out of Roche Harbor and plenty of space. Please let interested guests know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 4:04 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Graduation Priscilla, Alex, Chad & Kiersten! We are proud of you guys! Have a great life!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 6th, 2008 at 10:58 am\r\n\r\n    UPDATE ON SPA:\r\n    This weekend the Spa will allow one more extra booking starting @ 6.30pm for Fri Sat Sun only. If you have any questions ask me! ;)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 11:36 pm\r\n\r\n    We had a few guests tell us that they were unable to log on to our wireless. Called Morgan and did some troubleshooting. Thank You Morgan for helping us while in Seattle on your day off. We were unsuccessful and called the infamous Chris Terren. He worked on it quite a bit but said he was going to have to send the Big Guns over tomorrow and they will have to work on it.\r\n\r\n    Also Colleen from San Juan Safaris called to confirm a reservation and gave us a little fyi that they are offering an Adults only cruise for $85 per adult @ 130 starting this Saturday for people that don’t care to whale watch with children with a maximum of 12 people ages of 14 and up. And they are also adding Sunset tours now at 530 in the evening.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Boy I’m glad I had my great co-worker Tory with me today! What a crazy day/night! I pretty sure all the guest’s are happy though! So I’ll let Tory explain all the haps….But for Cindy: I could not move any of those boxes into the cedar room, or could I lift them into the ORCA room by myself. Some of them are real heavy. I am working bright and early in the morning so I think we can get it figured out before the party. Maybe I could get some strong help? I tried calling you, and Tory said you were really busy tonight. Well I’ll see you in the morning. Good night..ZZZZzzzzzz…..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 5th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    I can’t blog in the Bird Rock blog. Every time I submit the screen goes blank and it doesn’t save my message. I tried closing every tab, same thing. Why, why why?\r\n    So, anyway, below another blog for Bird Rock:\r\n\r\n    FIRE ALARM\r\n    I called Guardian and they’ll contact the electrician from L&I, he will be here in the next couple of days. Guardian will also call the Fire Marshall and ask if he just wants to stop by or if he wants Guardian to be there with him. Please blog when L&I comes.\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINES\r\n    We have spare espresso under the lobby counter. If we get low contact Laura, since she will have to order more online and it will take a couple of days.\r\n    Steve from SJ coffee researched some decalcifying agents for smaller machines. Laura, can I show you, maybe we can order some online? I contacted the machine manufacturer to no avail.\r\n\r\n    HOT TUB\r\n    Paul serviced the hot tub right after we checked it. Everything is good, please check again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I-HOMES & MATRESS COVER\r\n    Gio called me to pick up I-homes which were delivered to E. I believe they belong into the Sky places and not to Bird Rock. Laura? I left them at E for now.\r\n    There was also a organic cotton matress cover, which I took and placed in the luggage room. Please let Raquel know it is here.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for a good meeting today, keep up the good work.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Cynthia Elliot will be picking up legos that Theresa Romero is dropping off…I’m just a messenger. A lady that was staying in the Wind Place last night called tonight with this message. My feet hurt but my pants are cute.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    June 4th, 2008 at 8:46 pm\r\n\r\n    BELOW FIND MY BIRD ROCK BLOG, BIRD ROCK BLOG MOMENTARILY OUT OF SERVICE?\r\n\r\n    MORNING KAITLYN\r\n    Lina will be training with you on Thursday. She hasn’t done breakfast yet or answered the phone, everything else she has at least heard once. Please include her in your routine.\r\n    Also: can you work next Sunday (6/8 morning instead of night? Elena wants to have some kind of a life (ridiculous), Tory would work the PM if you worked the AM?\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK FD STAFF MEETING\r\n    Thursday, 2 PM. Elena & Stefan, please come down for that. Tory, please come an hour early and join us. Have your questions & suggestions ready. See you then.\r\n\r\n    ESPRESSO MACHINES\r\n    They need to be decalcified monthly. This will be our first time doing this and in the manual it says: ” Use a descaling agent and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.” Mhm. GIO, HELP! Is a descaling agent the white powdery stuff? I’ll call SJ coffee tomorrow and find out more.\r\n    Also: do we have more regular espresso pods, I can only find decaf?\r\n\r\n    FOOD\r\n    Elena got us produce (Thank you!) We have a couple of cases of fruit in the luggage room. Please go through every day and make sure we don’t have a rotten apple in there, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\n    PRINTER\r\n    I’ll ask Cindy to order us another ink cartridge. Did we run through the spare already, Elena?\r\n\r\n    Hey Laura, I think 400 earplugs will get us through the next couple of months. Let’s see. Thank you for getting them.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 3rd, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n    This is REALLY IMPORTANT: Starting immediately Victoria Clipper will be allowed to book 4 rooms above the block for the month of June, AND 4 rooms above the block Monday thru Thursday in July.\r\n\r\n    I know this seems complicated but there is an easy solution. Here’s what you do:\r\n\r\n    1. answer the phone, and if VC says, hi this is __________ from VC, I would like to book a room above the block\r\n\r\n    2. you say just one moment while I check availability\r\n\r\n    3. go to WEBREZ type in Victoria Clipper in the search box, scan down the list to see if there are rooms left above the block for that day (you will know because if you make a reservation above the block under the guests name it will say “ABOVE THE BLOCK”) if there isn’t say I am sorry I only have rooms available at our rack rate, if there are you take the reservation, using the VC pricing, you take the name of the guest, the clipper reservation #,(basically take all the info you do with a reg. VC reservation) and in the notes section you type in bold letters “ABOVE THE BLOCK”\r\n\r\n    4. REMEMBER NO above the block for weekends in July\r\n\r\n    5. Above the block will always be made over the phone, it will never come thru as a fax\r\n\r\n    6. You will see the above the block reservations on the fax, when it comes thru for us to confirm, but they will already be in the system.\r\n\r\n    ANY QUESTIONS, just ASK…\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 6:35 pm\r\n\r\n    CAFE ZIA: New rules: Until further notice, no one makes coffee in the coffee shop except me and Gio. (Gio, will you make sure that the coffee shop gets locked up, in case it was someone other than an employee who decided to help themselves to the supplies…)\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 6:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey guys! How did everyones weekend go?\r\n    I have a few things that I need to go over about the coffee shop. I have a million things back there, its disorganized and cluttered! This will be soon be fixed when I get a few days to soley be out there and do my thing. One thing though, I cannot be having people go out there a rummage through boxes, make coffee, ect and not CLEAN UP! I came out there this afternoon to find a PIG STY. Coffee had been left open, machine was filthy, and old crusted grounds left in the Portofilter that had completely dried up. I had to chizzle it out. Also coffee beans were spilled all over the grinder area, shot glasses that had been sitting with nasty residue in them. Dirty spoons……It goes on and on. I don’t mind that whoever wants to make a coffee, BUT you (coffee maker) is entitled to pick up your own mess. The coffee beans are not fresh anymore, and that really stinks! That was five pounds of coffee in there! I found this really disrespectful and rude to leave the mess for someone else to clean!\r\n    IMPORTANT!!\r\n    Every time you make shots, you have to dump the coffee out of the portafilter! This will ruin the gaskets!! And if you switch something around in there, like a different kind of coffee, let me know so I at least know where I’m at. That machine out there is really expensive, and if kept cleaned then it will last a lifetime! Please be respectful!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    June 2nd, 2008 at 1:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Please when you put out the bicycles, will you park them in their designated spot, they feel lonely and out of place when they are in the wrong parking spot:)\r\n    Flowers\r\n    NEVER EVER, have flowers in the lobby that have gross water and dead leaves, it is better to have no flowers then gross ones.\r\n    Surveys\r\n    The Surveys for our customers by the key machine are there so that everyone will give a survey to EVER check in. The SJIVB is trying to gather information and if WE don’t give them out, well let’s just say we are being lame. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE hand them out..\r\n    Thanks everyone for not parking in the wrong places,, I really appreciate it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 10:57 pm\r\n\r\n    LATE CHECK-OUTS\r\n    Most of the marathon folks are wanting a late check-out. While we have done our best to encourage people to depart on time and/or use the pool house for changing I have a feeling that we will have some major stragglers. Please warn Raquel/Regino in the morning. Hopefully everyone will be respectful of the check-out time. We tried not to give people later than a 11:30 check-out.\r\n    SYSCO\r\n    I have put in an order for two boxes of creamers. Hopefully we will get those on Monday. We may have to put out some of the powdered coffee-mate packets until they arrive.\r\n\r\n    That’s it! Laters!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    MOUSE\r\n    on front desk computer by white board is dying. Can we please get a new one?\r\n\r\n    CHECKING GUESTS OUT\r\n    Please remember to check out guests in the morning. WRP doesn’t let you check guests in when another person still checked into a room. Very confusing during ferry rush.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    Please fill out lost & found requests (in folder on back desk where bike release forms are) and give to Raquel or put in her box. Remember: sticky notes are not your friend! Also: when Raquel finds something in a room, she will put a little Lost & Found note describing the item on the HK report of the day the item was found. That way you can tell the guest that we have the item in question and fill out a Post San Juan form right there and then.\r\n\r\n    LUGGAGE\r\n    Please pay a lot of attention when giving guests their luggage. Always match the luggage tag in the luggage to the tag the guest gave you. One of us gave a guest’s luggage away today. I found it, but that is really really not o.k.\r\n\r\n    BACK DOOR KITCHEN\r\n    Most menus are in the room. Morgan & Khaili will finish the task tomorrow. So be prepared to get Room Service calls soon.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 31st, 2008 at 3:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\n    This morning went well, no real complaints other than a noisy neighbor who checked out today.\r\n\r\n    There are two lost item requests that I received this morning, they are on sticky notes next to the front desk phone. Please ask Raquel if anything was found, were looking for books and a sonic care tooth brush charger.\r\n\r\n    There was also one other thing, the pump in the pool house was making weird noises so Mo called Dave. He said it needed work and tried to get in touch with Rob Sandwith to fix the problem. If it is not fixed by tomorrow the planters by building A need to be watered so that the beautiful fleurs do not die.\r\n\r\n    I got to some of the alarms, there are still a few vouchers needed. Lots of reservations made today!! yay!!\r\n\r\n    -Priscilla\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 10:31 pm\r\n\r\n    INFO\r\n    - Nice night. Everybody is in and happy. (as of 10:30pm let’s hope it stays that way) Nice folks in 112 this weekend.\r\n    - I feel sorry for the folks at B-Rock because Herbs is holding a special impromptu Karaoke night tonight. Noisy off-key drunk people Booooo!\r\n\r\n    FOURTH OF JULY\r\n    OK. The theme of the fourth of July parade has been announced and I want to enter a float. I have had a hilariously funny (IMO) and slightly in-poor-taste idea for a float since High School. I have told several people about it over the years but I have never got around to actually doing it. Well this year is the year. I am looking to enlist some good men and women to join me as members of the A.P.S. Want to know what A.P.S. means? Come talk to me. I need at least 4-6 people to make this work, more is always better. Join the proud ranks of the A.P.S. I can promise free meeting refreshments, t-shirts, and black ski masks for all new recruits. Come on. If that doesn’t pique your interest I don’t know what will.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 7:07 pm\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    the keys (hideaway + pool) are in the door of the key cabinet on the back desk. The apartment is on top of Christie’s Island Salon, next to Creme Brulee. Guests may park here at E and use our amenities (pool, bikes, wireless, there is no wireless in the Hideaway). Check in like a regular check-in, then show guest location on a map.\r\n\r\n    Morgan is researching how to work in the US. Cindy or M might need to call the social security office in Mt Vernon on Monday, so we have everything we need when we go there on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n    Lina & Stefan will come early tomorrow and we’ll put the Back Door Kitchen menus in the rooms.\r\n    Both Lina & Stefan will have their birthdays while here, we so gonna have a party.\r\n\r\n    Cindy, I’ll go biking with you anytime. Next time let’s go all the way to Herb’s.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome Lina and Stefan, don’t worry being confused is okay, we all went through that. Enjoy and ask lots of questions.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 4:42 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan (acutally all employees who drive to work)\r\n    Mr. Morgan, will you please park your van up at lot A, (I am not trying to pick on you only but I noticed your van by building D when I was leaving)or where you usually do by your back gate. Adam will be passing out parking tickets for anyone who is parking in the NO parking zones… Beware…No really, right now this time or year, we all need to leave all front parking spaces and in the front of room parking spaces empty for our guests. There is plenty of parking up by building A on the side. Thanks everyone.\r\n    NEW BIKES\r\n    I have ordered 20 new beach cruisers 5 new orange, 5 new purple and for Bird Rock 5 shiney black and 5 vanilla. When they arrive please have them delivered up by the maintenance and make sure I know they are here. Morgan would you be willing to help assemble?\r\n    I have also ordered 20 new bike helmets, please put those in the front office.\r\n    June 6\r\n    You are all invited to Alex’s graduation party on the pool patio, even if you are on shift come out and get a yummy plate of Raquel food. It is from 5-8pm.. Be ready for my family, 18 members will be arriving on Friday:) Their lots of fun..\r\n    Steffi and Cindy\r\n    We went for a bike ride today, I must say it was short and sweet and am really think that it should be mandatory that we all take a spin once or twice a day to clear our heads when we are at work.. Steffi we should have made that ride longer..\r\n    Have a great weekend.\r\n    Lina Says:\r\n    May 30th, 2008 at 3:20 pm\r\n\r\n    HI! It’s my first day! I’m confused.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 7:49 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK PHONE NUMBER\r\n    Bird Rock’s business cards have one of the ELEMENTS phone number on it (4000). When calls come through that number and guests are confused, please be helpful and understanding, ask if they maybe wanted to reach Bird Rock and help them with their reservation. In general, when guests are inquiring about our sister hotel, just pull up the other hotel’s WRP and help them out. Thank you, Tory, for always doing that. We’ll fix the business cards soon.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT/CHECKING OUT GUESTS\r\n    Please remember to check out guests (on WRP) around 3 PM. This is a morning staff duty. Please mark all rooms clean at that time as well (unless they aren’t). WRP marks rooms dirty when you check a guest into a room, so you only need to mark rooms dirty manually if an unoccupied room is dirty for some reason (moved guest to a different room, construction, etc.)\r\n\r\n    STAFF CARS\r\n    Just a reminder: please park your car up by building A. Not by the lobby, not by building D. Thank you.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Steve from San Juan Pest was here this afternoon and said he may have solved the problem but that the little door on the office building in front of the tree by the van needs to be sealed up to prevent further problems.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 3:57 pm\r\n\r\n    JULY 4TH FERRY INFORMATION: Below is information from WSF regarding the FREE PARKING policy at the Anacortes Terminal over the dates of July 3-7. WSF is providing FREE PARKING over these dates since the smaller “Sealth” will be in service, which accommodates 50 less cars per sailing than usual. Please let our July 4 guests know about this FREE PARKING and encourage them to walk on the ferries. Also, please remind our guests that “Getting Here is Half the Fun” and ferry fares include a round trip. Thanks!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 29th, 2008 at 1:52 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA SERVICES: Annette (who sometimes works at Lavendera) is available to do manicures & pedicures in peoples’ rooms. The cost is $85. for on site. Her # is 378-1084 or the spa can be called & we can arrange it.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2008 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    There is a message from Samantha regarding res# 1065447. The lady was interested in pedicures for two people on Saturday 5/31 in the later afternoon. Called Sealy at the spa to ask about availability and Anette is available for in room pedicures on Saturday afternoon, but will need to be contacted directly @ home to schedule an appointment. I posted her number in Steffi’s office on the wall. Gio can you please contact the lady and let her know this information, she is having a dinner party this evening and would like a call back in the morning.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 28th, 2008 at 2:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Numbers, Numbers, Numbers…I have posted a new Target sheet updated as of today. Take a looksy, great work. We’re really close for May!!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 10:12 pm\r\n\r\n    Room #114 called and said that their room had not been tidied so I ran over some towels and coffee and picked up their used linen. I was in a little bit of a hurry to get back to the office( busy phone day) and forgot to close up the housekeeping closet. Thanks to Regino he noticed it! Thank You Regino!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    All employees working tomorrow, please wear a white shirt to the Bird Rock party, black, chocolate brown or khaki pants are fine for the bottom:) See you all there.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 27th, 2008 at 6:40 pm\r\n\r\n    A couple of things that I wanted to make sure got taken care of tomorrow. Steve from the bike shop called and let us know that bikes are ready to be picked up. Also res# 1147168 has misplaced a white ipod between here and California and wondered if maybe we might have seen it. Housekeeping staff has left for the day so could someone please ask them tomorrow morning. I did let them know that we would contact them if we found it. Thank You!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 26th, 2008 at 9:44 pm\r\n\r\n    MUST BE A FULL MOON SOON….\r\n    Well all guests but one are here. #31376 is a remote check in. towards the end of the night it went really smooth. I had some fun EH people in the living room area playing Bridge. They were cute. Had a KNARLEY clipper person. I couldn’t how she pronounced her last name, so by the 2nd or 3rd time, ei… “P-R-O-N-O-U-N-C-E-D” everything like that. Then said the room # like that too. The sons were mortified. I laughed inside and smiled one the outside. Overcame my first challenging position…not to let my head pop off.\r\n    A FEW THINGS:\r\n    #1112884 they would LOVE a mini table so they can play cards! Their with the EH. Dont know if that can happen, I told them that I would ask.\r\n    #31376 was a late check. Please make sure he brings our copy in.\r\n    We REALLY need hot cup for the lobby…I could gets some from the coffee shop, but I didn’t know if we had some more stocked away. It is late and everyone had gone home for the evening.\r\n    Napkins? We need them as well for up front. Also, we should order some more 1/2 and 1/2 we have very little left. Should I order some with my next lil order with Gerard?\r\n    I’m trying really hard not get to sleepy. It’s past my usual bedtime. Well, I think that’s it for now. I’ll be in late again so no coffee for Cindy! Ha ha Kidding. I’ll make it whenever. Everyone have a marvelous day tomorrow, and see you at three :0\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    SUMMER IS HERE!!\r\n    Busy, busy, busy today! Steffi and I were running all over the place.\r\n    Steffi pretty much covered everything.\r\n    Morgan, I will be here at 10 to help you out, not that you couldn’t handle it yourself :D\r\n    Again, there was a couple that wants a massage s.b.s. massage. Their res # is 211260956. I left a message about it on their room answering machine, but they haven’t called back. You can read more about that in their guest remarks.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 7:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen, we are sold out! YEAH!!!\r\n    Couple of things: #1137861 was promised an upstairs room (she is from the city and doesn’t sleep in downstairs rooms), I was able to move her in one. Please make sure to write special requests like that, especially for longer stays, in the guest remarks, so when we have to move people around, we know.\r\n\r\n    #1146300 had booked a massage online, when he arrived the time we had scheduled it for, really didn’t work for him and he felt cheated. I took massage off bill. Khaili and I are trying hard to sell their 9AM SBS appointment for tomorrow morning. Morgan, if you have inquiries tomorrow, please keep that opening in mind. If we don’t sell it, we’ll have to pay for it. Please always ask for a time frame during which a massage would be pleasant for the guest.\r\n\r\n    A family called from Lime Kiln and wanted to be picked up. They rode our bikes and were very upset that nobody had told them how far it was and that the bikes don’t have gears. I called a cab for them. Khaili apologized profusely. Please let guests know that our bikes don’t have gears and that our pretty island is quite hilly.\r\n\r\n    The other 69 rooms? Happy!\r\n\r\n    Back Door Kitchen\r\n    My plan to put the menus in the rooms today was utterly unrealistic. Morgan, can you please start tackling that early next week. I won’t be at E until next Friday. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Elderhostel\r\n    Will arrive tomorrow. Morgan made a rooming list (on back desk). Quite a few early arrivals, don’t forget to mark them checked in tomorrow morning and print out invoices and make keys for the others.\r\n\r\n    Great job everybody, our first busy weekend. We still got it:)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 3:13 pm\r\n\r\n    SMALL SNAFU\r\n    Please read the notes on Reso #1147263 I got it taken care of with out the guest having to worry about it. Cindy, sorry but we will be receiving a bill from San Juan Excursions because of it.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 9:03 am\r\n\r\n    GUEST #211567570\r\n    Charged guest this morning for the room. Priscilla was unable to sell it. Guest was a UNIREZ that called to cancel last night for her Saturday night stay. I removed the room tax.\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well, sadly, we had a couple of open rooms last night. But I can proudly say that none of them were the rooms I put on hold. :D (jk) Only 330 is held for tonight at the moment.\r\n    SOLD OUT\r\n    Well I just made the rounds of calling all the hotels on the island and I am happy to report that only us and Bird Rock are sold out. Be sure to refer anyone who calls to the FHH, BW, RH, DI, & B&B Assoc. Don’t let our occupancy level get to your head though. I am still praying to the gods of hospitality that everything goes smoothly today. *knocks on desk*\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 25th, 2008 at 8:15 am\r\n\r\n    Thank you Steffi for commenting about how it is nice to check in guests who are excited to be here, it IS contagious. AND the reverse of this is also true. Enthusiasm is contagious and it is OUR!! JOB!! to give that to our guests. In fact, Adam and I were talking about this remembering some of the wonderful feedback that we got about our great customer service last year. To be honest, a lot of that came from some of our younger staff who have had such a delightfully warm and cheery demeanor. I’ve noticed that it’s easy for our more seasoned staff to slip into a kind of dourness that is, unfortunately, also contagious. Let this be a reminder to all of us to ALWAYS welcome our guests with enthusiasm. EVERY guest deserves this and is PAYING for it. So, regardless of their attitude as they first walk through the door, it is OUR JOB to do give enthusiasm.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi summed it up pretty well. Tomorrows sold out!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\r\n\r\n    So far so good, couple of rough patches, checked in a wrong guest in the wrong room, a frozen fridge (Priscilla was gone for an hour chiseling ice away), blocked sink, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    is full at noon tomorrow, has plenty of room for their 4 PM sailing\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    updated through July, will do August next week.\r\n\r\n    It is such a pleasure to check in guests who are so excited to be here. It’s contagious.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 24th, 2008 at 12:45 pm\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    Well… Due to a couple of “emergencies” we are now down to only 218 for Sunday night. We still have 215 and 218 held for tonight though.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 10:07 pm\r\n\r\n    I have one more:\r\n    BOOMTIME\r\n    please put the processed (and accounted for in WRP as vouchers) gift certificate print out and put it in the cash drawer (not with the other invoices), so I can reconcile them when I reconcile cash.\r\n    Gracias.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 9:48 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BEGINNING OF THE SEASON!\r\n\r\n    INTERNET RESERVATIONS: Adding to Steffi’s comment about printing out these reservations, Cindy noticed yesterday that we have to print out these reservations BEFORE CONFIRMING THEM!! Apparently, once they are confirmed any add-ons DISAPPEAR. Yikes!\r\n\r\n    Steffi-Could you please pass that valve on Building F issue with Raquel and Regino? Thanks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy\r\n\r\n    BACKDOOR KITCHEN\r\n    We switched from STEPS to Backdoor Kitchen for our room service. Currently all STEPS menus are out of the rooms. Morgan and I will put the Backdoor Kitchen menus with a new cover sheet in the rooms by Sunday. The procedure stays the same:\r\n    1) Guest calls BD Kitchen and puts in order\r\n    2) BD Kitchen calls us and tells us when the order is ready\r\n    3) We go get the food with our fancy yellow hot holding bag (where is the second one, the one which was in the luggage room? Tory got the one they had at STEPS)\r\n    4)We present food on a tray with proper silverware and plates and bring it, together with 2 copies of the invoice to the guest room.\r\n    5) Guest signs invoice and has delicious meal\r\n    6) We put food bill plus 15 % on guests bill and charge credit card.\r\n\r\n    FOLLOW UP AND THROUGH, NOW MORE THAN EVER\r\n    Morgan, please run down to ACE and get AAA batteries (and Regino a bottle of WD40, I took his to Bird Rock, he needs it). I was in remote control hell today, had to find empty rooms and snatch batteries out of their remotes.\r\n\r\n    When you have a rollaway or crib request or an Elderhostel early arrival or stayover, please write it in the HK comment section in WRP. No fun to roll around rollaways after HK is gone.\r\n\r\n    Please print out EVERY online reservation, highlight the special requests, process it and put it in the basket on the back desk. Had another missed whale watch today. Guest isn’t here yet, but whale watch companies are not picking up their phones at 8.30PM. So let’s hope the guest has mercy with me.\r\n    And make it a habit to double check those reservations in the basket.\r\n\r\n    Happy beginning of the season, everybody. Let’s keep our spirits high and stay focused. Another couple of weeks and we will have lot’s of staff and we will just be hopping.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 5:14 pm\r\n\r\n    VALVE ON BUILDING F\r\n    The gardener lady stopped by and said somebody had turned off the blue valve on the backside of building F below the spigot. That valve needs to stay on, it waters the hanging baskets.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 11:59 am\r\n\r\n    HOLD ROOMS\r\n    I have now put three rooms on emergency hold for Saturday night. Don’t forget that we have 216, 217, 218 held for both Saturday night and Sunday night now. We’re selling out quick so don’t forget to release the rooms back into the wild if everything is looking copasetic.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 23rd, 2008 at 10:06 am\r\n\r\n    Gift Certificates\r\n    When you receive an email from Boomtime saying that someone has just purchased a gift certificate from us, you must enter it in Webrez Pro on the same day. Here is what you do:\r\n    1. Begin process like any other GC transaction in Webrezpro\r\n    2. Use GC number from Boomtime, (to get this number you will have to log into Boomtime website to get it),\r\n    3.Please print off credit card transaction detail for the transaction you are working with from the Boomtime website\r\n    4. When you enter the transaction in Webrez please use the Boomtime GC number as your confirmation number\r\n    5. When you get the point where you have to accept payment in Webrezpro you will apply payment as a voucher. Then you will take the credit card print off from Boomtime and put it in your cash drawer up front and write “count as cash” on it.\r\n    5. This paper will need to be attached to your reconciliation report at the end of the night.\r\n    6. Don’t forget to manually enter it in our GC register in the front desk book, we need that paper trail.\r\n    Does this make sense, if not ask me or Morgan..\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Nordstrom Girls want a late checkout in room #314 they will not be able to get the belongings out of that room until 300p.m. at the latest.They will be checking out of all their rooms at regular checkout time they just needed that room to store somethings while out on their shoot.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 5:01 pm\r\n\r\n    OPEN HOUSE AT BIRD ROCK: Next Wednesday, 3pm-7pm. Be there or be square. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell them, tell them.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 4:56 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH!!\r\n    Your opportunity to earn extra cash has arrived. See the bulletin board in Steffi’s office to get the full scoop.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG HOLE: Kaitlyn made a good point on the Bird Rock blog in that if you have posted to the blog about an issue that will happen while you are off and by the time you get back the issue will me moot, you can’t do much more than post it. All I’m really asking is that you follow up where necessary. Thanks, guys!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 22nd, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    MAKE SURE TO CONFIRM RESERVATION DETAILS WITH GUEST!! I just got a call from a woman who thought she made a reservation with us for July 25th. Thankfully she looked through her email confirmation carefully and noticed that the reservation was made for 2009! BE VERY VERY VERY CAREFUL, we ALL make mistakes and this is why you need to CONFIRM, CONFIRM, CONFIRM.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey everyone-\r\n    Thought I would go right into my first question:\r\n    Gio, did you follow up on res# 1141580’s kayak and whale watch? I saw that you had highlighted those options and put the print out of the reservation in the basket, but in the guest remarks it didn’t say anything about them. The print out of the reservation is still in the basket.\r\n\r\n    My second question is about the incoming calls on the 378-8275 line. It seems like I answer a lot of calls on that line and there isn’t anyone on the other end. Has anyone else noticed this?\r\n\r\n    The man in 334 for the night is with the school board. He will be in meetings from 7:30am-4:00pm and I told him that he could just leave his luggage in the room until the housekeepers come and they can bring it to the lobby. He said that was fine, but he may just take them with him so there is a possibility that there will be no luggage in there tomorrow when we go to get them. Morgan and I had done this once before, so I hope that was okay.\r\n\r\n    Phew… I think that is all.\r\n    Everything has been pretty quite since I got here at three. I tried to stock the gift shop, but I couldn’t find the extra boxes of the gift shop stuff in the ceder room. Do you have any clue, Morgan?\r\n\r\n    That is all for now. See you on Sunday.\r\n    ~Khaili\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 4:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Congrats, GIO! The Caffe D’Arte folks came today to train us on how to use their coffee in our espresso machine and Gio earned high accolades from them for her delicious coffee and beautiful espresso art. The trainer (an award-winning espresso-art designer) said that Gio was AMAZING!\r\n\r\n    So, when Cafe Zia opens up this summer, you’ll all have to submit not only your taste buds, but your eyes as well, to a wonderful treat.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    JOYEUX ANNIVERSAIRE, GELUKKIGE VERJAARDAG, 生日快乐, FELIZ CUMPLEANOS, 誕生日おめでとう, FELIZ ANIVERSARIO, 축 생일!\r\n\r\n    Hi Morgan, I just wanted to add a little international flair to the mix. Happy Birthday!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLACK HOLE: We manager types have been noticing that the blog, while wonderful, has it’s drawbacks. Namely, lack of follow-through. You’ve all been doing a wonderful job at posting details that need to be followed up on. And, for the most part, you’ve been doing well at following up on these, but SOMETIMES, balls get dropped. So, NEW RULES: when YOU post something on the blog, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that somebody followed up on it.\r\n\r\n    TRANSFERRING PHONES TO CINDY AND LAURA: When someone requests to be transferred back to Cindy, Laura, the manager, the owner, someone in charge of something, if we are in the office, please do the following: Say “let me check to see if she is available, may I get your name please?” and then call us to see if we want to take the call. We may, we may not. We may be here, but don’t want to be interrupted. If we don’t want to take the call, please tell the person “I’m sorry, she is currently unavailable, is there anything I can help you with or would you like to be transferred to her voice mail?”. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    May 21st, 2008 at 10:07 am\r\n\r\n    YAAAAYYY MORGAN HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOO YOU!\r\n    Have an awsome birthday, celebrate till you can’t celebrate no more. And remember you are only as old as you feel!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    WIFI\r\n    The gentleman in 109 is having a horrible time connecting to our wireless. He is a close to the antenna as you can get in Building A. I have tried all my tricks but it barely connects and when I did get him connected it kicked him off after a few minutes. I have left a message on TechieChris’s phone. Hopefully he can find an easily fixable cause for this guy’s problem. He has a newer-ish HP laptop running XP.\r\n\r\n    OTHER INFO\r\n    – 340 is fixed and is open and ready to go.\r\n    – Regino is in 321\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 9:32 pm\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MORGAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!! Sorry you are not here on your birthday May 21, 2008 Wednesday..\r\n    Morgan will be coming by though on the afternoon, shall we say 3:30 ish, and we will have some yummy cake for him. Make sure to belt out your Happy Birthday wishes to him when you see him walking around the hotel.\r\n    Thanks Khaili and Morgan for getting the brochures organized. It is such an important thing to have easy at hand, especially when are lobby is full and we have curious guests looking for things to do. It is a great idea to put the doggy information for checkin in the front office in the bottom drawer, easy at hand and less clutter in Steffi’s office. Smooth procedures in our front office:)\r\n    Sorry Gio you where hungry the other morning, I am sure those nice folks didn’t mean to deny your growling tummy, try and be louder next time:)\r\n    Housekeeping items: Your chance is getting closer to submit any great ideas you may have for us to bring to our housekeeping meeting, let Laura and I know what you think, by Thursday am.\r\n    Tory\r\n    I took care of canceling that check, sorry again that those dorks took your truck and stoled your belongings. I will have a replacement one for you tomorrow.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 7:46 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey-\r\n    So, just wanted to let you all know that I moved all the brochures to the back office(Steffi’s) and all the doggie packets are in the main part of the office in the bottom drawer where the brochures were. If this doesn’t make any sense ( very possible) just ask Morgan, Cindy or I.\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Okay, quick question for Cindy, before I forget:\r\n    Both of the brochure drawers that we in the front office are now cleared, and I put the brochures in Steffi’s office where you said. The drawers that I cleared out.. what do you want to do with them? I’m not sure if you had some sort of plan or not, but Morgan suggested that we put the doggie information packets in there. Any ideas?\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 20th, 2008 at 10:40 am\r\n\r\n    I forgot to blog yesterday, so a few things:\r\n    First, one thing to start doing in the morning is to see if we have any appts. with the spa, then to call spa and double check on the appts. Spa had a little slip up on friday, Ceily and I were going over some ways to make sure everything is in the clear. Also when booking massages, always ask what kind of treatment they were wanting (deep tissue, reflexoligy ect…)This is a way to prevent having to call extra times to the guest, so it all gets done in one shot. One more thing…When booking a couples massage, or SBS WE have to have the second guests first and last name as per Ceily or else they cant book the treatment in their system.\r\n    I’m going to share with all of you my thoughts about our morning breakfast setup. Morgan, yes I came in and opened early, the group was wanting to set up right when I unlocked @ 7:10am. YIKES. About all of the food…. Lots of yummy food, lots of left over yummy food that was then thrown away right in front of me. *belly gurgling in hunger* I was surprised that they had non to offer >:0 Oh well, I guess. It was a little rude I must say though!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 10:17 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello hello-\r\n    My first week day shift today! Whhhoooh. The phone was ringing pretty steadily so there were no dull moments tonight. I also cleaned out the brochure drawer in the main office. It was a mess, but now they are organized by category and will be alphabetized by tomorrow, thanks to my O.C.D. And Cindy’s, too.\r\n    Okay, so I KNOW that there was something relatively important to write in here, but I can’t remember. Maybe I will by tomorrow.\r\n    OH! Morgan talked to the spa today and they said that the spa amenities lists were gone and they had ordered some, so they should be here shortly.\r\n    Good news for the girls: I tried on one of the girls shirts that Cindy ordered. They are much more feminine than the other ones :)\r\n    Alrighty, that is it. I think….\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 9:51 pm\r\n\r\n    It’s BLOG! It’s BLOG! It’s big, it’s heavy, it’s good!\r\n    Lot’s of stuff today.\r\n    – Building B is mostly blocked out until\r\n    Wednesday so that Rob can nail down a problem we are having with insufficiently heated water in the rooms.\r\n    – Angevine Middle School arrived today so we will be hearing the pitter-patter of prepubescent feet throughout the property. The pool is, as always, very popular. Make sure you keep an eye on them when they are using the pool. They were playing with the rescue equipment earlier. Their coordinator has asked to use the conference room for an hour or two on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Cindy said it was alright. They also need to drop off a rooming list with us. I have already received 2 calls from parents wanting to talk to their kids but, with no rooming list…we can’t help them.\r\n    – The Nordstrom folks are going to be using the lobby bright and early for breakfast. They will be here right at 7:30 to set up. Sorry for the inconvenience Miss Gio. But on the bright side they might have some good food to share. :P\r\n    – 343 is a late check-in. I have left copies of her invoice in the room. She is a direct bill with the school district so it’s not a big worry.\r\n    – We are almost selling out on Sunday the 25th. I have taken 3 Earth Places (216, 217, 218) out of availability to use as Emergency hold rooms. You can release them as needed in the “Unit Maintenance” section. Whoo! Memorial Day weekend: The official kick-off of the summer season.\r\n    – Please ask housekeeping in the morning if 340 has been put back together or not. We haven’t heard if the A/C unit has been replaced.\r\n    – 324’s sink is draining very slowly. Please ask housekeeping to put some Drano down it. I could only find a small amount to use last night.\r\n\r\n    Well that’s about that. Remember: Don’t let the craziness get you down. Roll with it. The craziest days always go the fastest and the summer is always over before you notice. :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 8:14 pm\r\n\r\n    HOUSEKEEPING CHECK LIST: There will be a housekeeping meeting this Thursday. I will be attending that meeting and I am hoping to get feedback from you front deskers on any housekeeping issues. Is there any feedback that you are getting from the guests that I can relay to the housekeepers? Are there any items you notice that are repeatedly getting missed? Are they doing a really fantastic job and you think they should know it? If you each could write up a “housekeeping wish list” for me, I would be ever-so-grateful, and I will go over this with the housekeepers on Thursday.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 7:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello all,\r\n    We are going to be welcoming our first 2 employees from Muldova tomorrow:) Thier names are Diana and Olesa. Please show them our warm island welcome.\r\n    H2O\r\n    Laura and I have decided it is a good idea to rent out room 343 and see if we have any other water issues before we repair the ceiling in room 337. That way if it was only the toliet overflowing we will know. Please make sure to keep me informed on the water flow.\r\n    Bldg B\r\n    I have talked to Seth we are going to give Rob Sandwith a call. I called Rob he is going to stop by tomorrow and take a look, but it is one of the issues we have periodically in that same building, it has to do with having some pipes crossed when they did the plumbing years ago.\r\n    Victoria Clipper\r\n    It has started, we will begin receiving calls around 11:00am and 2:15pm every day to say the boat has arrived and IF we have guests checking in that day that is when we will send our van driver to pick them up, Please call Regino first if he is working, and then Seth. We will also be bringing our guests who are checking out to the VC when they depart daily at 4:00pm, we will need to call the van driver for them at that time also, this is just part of our summer protocal.\r\n    Just ask if you have any questions.\r\n    One more thing: I have ordered the girl cut front desk shirts. I hope you will all like them :)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 19th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    GUEST SURVEYS:\r\n\r\n    You know that pile of paper sitting back by the key card machine?? Well, those are guest surveys from/for the Visitors Bureau. Please, please, please, hand those out to guests when they check in and tell them that we would be so grateful if they could take a minute to fill it out and drop it back by the front desk some time. When they come in, just put them on my desk and I’ll send them to the Visitor’s Bureau.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:35 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan,\r\n    please run to Ace and get us AAA batteries and a can of WD40 for Regino\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 8:04 pm\r\n\r\n    One more thing before I leave–\r\n    I noticed that we are almost out (we have one more) of the spa brochures, so when the spa opens in the morning, someone should go grab some more. Just an observation.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 7:03 pm\r\n\r\n    Everything is going well. The Nordstrom group is here, and we just had our last check in for the night. It wasn’t too busy, but I can definitely tell that summer is coming… yay!\r\n\r\n    Steffi and I tried out the espresso machine (the little one in the back.) I was pretty impressed, although the shots were a little watery. Anyways, not much to pass on.\r\n    I will be back for my first week day shift tomorrow! See you all then.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 5:13 pm\r\n\r\n    #1138177 (room 335)\r\n    Taken care of, read WRP.\r\n\r\n    Building D\r\n    My inner plumber tells me that we have a “traveling water” problem, maybe water from yesterday’s overflow is traveling along lines or through the crawl space? Water coming down 335 was rosty looking. Maybe we should have Seth or Rob open the ceiling in 337 (see blog below)? Morgan and I moved the Nordstroms people out of that building, just in case.\r\n\r\n    Lobby fridge\r\n    You espresso making folks: somebody made espresso with the spiffy machine, unplugged the fridge to use the outlet and forgot to plug it back in. Now the fridge is defrosted and all the food in there is bad. I will starve tonight and Cindy will starve tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Nordstroms\r\n    Most of the group is here. They may use the lobby for breakfast tomorrow but not before 8, so Gio doesn’t need to come early.\r\n    Some of the group will arrive tomorrow, one even the day after tomorrow. All invoices printed (by key machine), just make keys.\r\n\r\n    Middleschool\r\n    Group will arrive tomorrow (list of rooms by key maker, group leader Mike Medina). Please make keys after noon and ask group leader which rooms may need futons.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    We need to get new locks for the bikes. I had to chase after a guy this morning who rode off with one.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 18th, 2008 at 9:14 am\r\n\r\n    THE CURSE OF BUILDING D Part 3\r\n    335 informed me this morning that water was coming down the wall over the microwave area. It wasn’t a rushing torrent like 337’s was but more of a steady trickle. Regino is going to go take a look. We need to call the guest as their were other problems as well.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 10:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Not to much going on tonight, made lots of vouchers!!\r\n    Anyways, the night was slow, Friday Harbor House referred some guests up here who needed some rooms. Thank you FHH.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, room number 335 will be looking to talk to a manager about a noise complaint.\r\n\r\n    thats all,\r\n    priscill\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 3:44 pm\r\n\r\n    THE SAGA CONTINUES: 337 STRIKES BACK\r\n    Well Regino believes that he may have isolated the problem in 343 and fixed it. A loose toilet hose was to blame he thinks. Housekeeping has got the room ready. We are still going to keep 337 blocked out so Seth can look at the ceiling in the bathroom. There are multiple paint bubbles of varying sizes that appear to be water-filled. The ceiling is also soft to the touch and deforms easily when pushed up. I believe that we may need to replace it. If anything, a hole should be cut so Seth can see what the inside looks like.\r\n\r\n    -May the farce be with you.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 2:15 pm\r\n\r\n    is 337 a WATER ROOM??? ha ha. not funny kaitlyn\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 12:59 pm\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Big Rob has spoken and said the following: if it’s not leaking right now, no pipe is broken, so the flood originated from an overflow of something, man made so to speak. My trusty side kick M-dog and I will go in there later and flush the toilet and splash around and if it doesn’t flood again, we’ll open the room back up, keep an eye on it and go from there.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 8:43 am\r\n\r\n    Yes, there is another spa in town, but I want to make sure that you guys know to refer to Lavendera first and to Spa D’Bune only if Lavendera is full or if a guest specially requests something that Lavendera doesn’t do (e.g. side-by-side pedicures, haircuts, etc.)\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 17th, 2008 at 8:39 am\r\n\r\n    Wow, sounds like a crazy night. What’s the status with Building D? Did Seth get called?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 9:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Ach ja, ze Sauerkraut famine, bad times, bad times….. Back then, when somebody didn’t follow up on something, we just ate them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 8:31 pm\r\n\r\n    THE GREAT AMERICAN HOTEL NOVEL\r\n    Chapter 1 – The Curse of Building D\r\n    It was a calm, sunny day. A day so longed for by the business people of the small tourist-oriented town of Friday Harbor. A type of day that could lull even the staunchest of hotel front desk clerks into comfortable lanquidity. But not Steffi. Steffi came from long, respected line of Germanic hospitality-worker stock. Her forbearers served various hotels with distinction during such dark times as WWI, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and The Great Sauerkraut Famine of 1964. Therefore, when the call came from 337 her finely tuned customer service skills allowed her to leap into action with nary a second thought. Over the phone, a harried voice came crackling through. A veritable torrent of water was cascading down the wall in #1138719’s bedroom. Knowing exactly what do to, she sent her trusty side-kick, Morgan, into the fray. Ok enough with the narrative…\r\n    – Water was found pouring (literally) down the wall in 337. I believe it may have originated from the toilet in 343. I have blocked out both rooms for the next few days. I have shut off water to the toilet in 343. It may not even be to toilet because water was coming down the inside, bedroom/bathroom partition wall of 337 and the toilet is located against the outside wall. Who knows.\r\n    – Apparently the fan/air conditioner in 340 hasn’t been repaired yet. We checked some folks into that room and the fan was ripped out of the wall. I know that room was blocked out before, I guess it wasn’t blocked out long enough.\r\n    – Please make sure housekeeping cleans 334 in the morning. The guests were moved to another room that they liked better. House keeping will have to replace the ice bucket in there because they took it along to their new room.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 16th, 2008 at 3:57 pm\r\n\r\n    NEW SPA IN TOWN\r\n    Spa d bune, 669 Mullis St, Suite 101 (by thrift store), 360.370.5027\r\n    They pick guests up and have a manicure and pedicure person on staff, they do hair as well, so they will be a great addition to the services our spa offers (they have regular massages as well).\r\n    I’ll put their menu in our voucher folder.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 5:11 pm\r\n\r\n    #1039804 (BIRD ROCK)\r\n    Tory, please stop by ELEMENTS on your way to work and get a check from Cindy for Market Chef, then go to Market Chef and pick up 3 vegetarian lunches for above reservation (around $15 each). Then put the lunches in the lobby fridge or better yet, give them to the super sweet family staying in the Bainbridge. They will go on a kayak trip on Saturday (but Market Chef closed on Saturday).\r\n    Then please add th cost of the lunch plus 15% to the guest’s room and charge the card on file.\r\n    Muchas Gracias.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 4:18 pm\r\n\r\n    BUBBLES\r\n    I ordered a case of Ch. St Michelle (WA) champagne from Mosquito Fleet Mercantile (378-4190). It will be here Monday or Wednesday. Gio and Morgan, if you get the message, please swing down there with a check and pick it up.\r\n    Let’s see (with our mouths) if we like the brand, if not we’ll switch back to the dwarf bubbles.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 15th, 2008 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    I called Regino and he is going to do the van run for Elderhostel on Saturday. I told Regino to plan on doing the first run at 7:30am, Tory please call your sweet little elderhostel ladies back and see if that is the time they would like to leave.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    2 of our sweet elderhostel ladies would like a ride down to the ferry landing Saturday morning @ 800 a.m. Would someone call them in the morning and confirm with them. Res#1094245\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    Our group #9792, is going to have Cynthia’s do the breakfast on the morning of the 19th, if it is nice weather it will be on the patio of the pool, if it is not, I have offered them the lobby area (Orca room taken at this time) Please be very accommodating and go with the flow (as always) :)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 1:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Customer Service\r\n    May 22 at 9:45am until 1:00pm there is going to be a customer service seminar held in our Conference room. Laura and I would like all front desk staff to attend. This will be paid for and lunch is included. Please talk to Steffi and confirm you are going.\r\n    Thanks so much..\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 14th, 2008 at 12:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Bldg B and C are open for business:)\r\n    Pool\r\n    Morgan, previous employee’s using the pool need to be ran by Laura, Steffi or I.\r\n    Sun, Sun, Sun,\r\n    I know you hate it Morgan, but it makes me SO happy, we need some sun rays.\r\n    Reservation # 1133948\r\n    Is a direct bill, please put all their information in my box\r\n    Thanks everyone, your smiles are contagious, remember that.\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 9:59 pm\r\n\r\n    SEVERE WEATHER ALERT\r\n    Well our favorite little red exclamation point just showed up on my browser toolbar. Oh joy of joys, apparently we have some “unseasonably warm weather…” heading our way. Well it’s supposed to hit between Thursday and Sunday. I guess we better tell Raquel/Regino to start prepping all the room fans. Darn. Just when I was diggin’ all the rain. (not sarcasm)\r\n    FOLLOW UPS\r\n    Sorry for leaving you so many Miss Gio. Everybody and their brother called tonight to make spa reservations. I left messages on the spa’s phone for all of them. A lady also left a message on the phone but didn’t want to be called back until tomorrow (I was on the other line when she called at around 9:30pm). I left her phone number on the message pad by the phone. She’s looking for June 21st for 2 adults and 1 dog.\r\n    BUILDINGS B & C\r\n    Raquel wasn’t feeling too well and decided to leave the faucet/toilet/spigot check until morning. I have not unblocked the rooms yet but please do so when we get the ok from her. Leave 321 blocked though because Regino will be in there for the next 2 nights.\r\n    LOST AND FOUND\r\n    Guest #1110444 left a pair of glasses in the room. I told him we would call him tomorrow if housekeeping found them. I had to run an errand for a guest and found them on the housekeeping table. I started to fill out a Post San Juan shipping form for you. I hope the address on file is the one he wants it shipped to.\r\n    POOL HOUSE\r\n    Ok. I’m serious here. We NEED to get either a sign that says the pool is under video surveillance or a PA system in there. It’s that, or I start bottling the Jacuzzi water and sell it off as an aphrodisiac. No kidding. I’ll do it. If bear gall bladders can be an aphrodisiac why not ELEMENTS Brand jacuzzi water? Any takers??? (P.S. I vote for the PA system. I swear I won’t abuse it by doing something inappropriate like piping some Barry White in there next time I catch some folks being …well…you know…inappropriate.)\r\n    That’s it! Laters!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 2:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Guess what? I got the Espresso machine up and running! Changed the gaskets, and now the process begins! First: Everyday the machine need to have a least a gallon of hot water expressed from it. Do not make any coffee until the machine has been checked by Cafe Darte! So about expressing hot water: Take the hot water only from the hot water hot water spikit (the dragon) It is going to take at least 10 min. Ask Gio for Directions! Yeah Coffee..good coffee very soon.\r\n    COFFEE TRAINING!\r\n    Cafe D’arte is coming up on the 21st of this month from 11-2pm\r\n    anyone that want to be trained, please join me at the shop! FUN lot of fun! Have great day!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 1:14 pm\r\n\r\n    BLDG B & C:\r\n    Water issues continue. Rob and Seth are working out there right now. They may be able to open the rooms today. If they give you the go-ahead, call Raquel and ask her to check the rooms first.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 13th, 2008 at 9:05 am\r\n\r\n    Guest #1097453 Has requested a continental breakfast for August 21, 22, 23 for the orca room. She said that in the past that Raquel has done this, but that they didn’t let us know in time to do so. So She is giving us an early heads up. Is this something we could do? If so she is faxing an itinerary with small food that stay fresh through out the day. ie..Cookies things like that. Anyway I have made an alarm and wrote in the guest notes about this. If someone could let me know the stats on something like this, that would be GREAT! Thanks\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 9:59 pm\r\n\r\n    NOTES:\r\n    – I think 310 has a dog. I was getting ready to close up and I saw someone walking by Building E with a dog and then looked back and saw them gone but the door to 310 closing. We should ask them in the morning because they are checking out on Tues. That’s a big no no.\r\n    – What’s our policy on letting former employees use the pool? I was asked by some of them tonight. *heavy sigh*\r\n    – Room 109 says that their fridge is noisy. It may need to be defrosted. The guest is planning on unplugging it for the duration of her stay.\r\n    – Cookies. I picked up a bunch of cookies for the party and pulled a stupid and forgot about them in the back room. Maybe we should put them out for guests or something… HAHAHA What am I thinking? We should horde them and stuff our faces with their sweet crumbly goodness. mmmmm…*drool*\r\n    – That’s it.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 3:54 pm\r\n\r\n    The water will be back on Monday at 5pm… Whew\r\n    Raquel know to double check all rooms that were affected to run, all sinks, toilets and showers to check for air bubbles, and brown water. Please do not unblock rooms until you check with Raquel.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 9:31 am\r\n\r\n    I missed the big fiesta! :( Unfortunately, Zayden (my son) had his first case of the stomach flu. I guess I can start planning for next year? I was realllllllly hungry for Raquel’s yummy food too. I hope everyone had a blast! Maybe I can see pictures?\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 12th, 2008 at 8:44 am\r\n\r\n    114 is blocked out until Wed am for Elderhostel kitchen workers. Please have housekeeping clean room when the water is fixed and they will no longer need it.\r\n    Thanks\r\n    Cindy\r\n    ♥ Elena ♥ Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 9:28 pm\r\n\r\n    FOLDER FOR GUEST\r\n    There is a folder on the back desk for guest #1117923. Please make sure and give it to them before they leave.\r\n\r\n    Things were pretty much quiet around here with the exception of one room but, I won’t go into detail since I believe wining is not allowed on the blog. he he\r\n\r\n    Happy Mother’s day all you wonderful office mommies.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 9:26 pm\r\n\r\n    BUBBLES\r\n    No, we haven’t ordered more (we have a full case at BR in case it gets hairy). Laura was playing with the idea of ordering some through the wine shop. Laura, shall we check them out?\r\n\r\n    KULTURE KORNER\r\n    I just have to tell you guys about this cute movie I saw last night. It’s called L’Iceberg, a Belgian movie in which there is almost no dialog. It’s in the style of comedia del arte, very expressive acting, no talking. It’s the story of the manager of a fast food restaurant, who locks herself in the walk-in by accident over night. She survives somehow, goes home and finds that neither her husband nor her kids had even noticed her absence. She henceforth becomes obsessed with cold and goes out in the world to find herself an iceberg. There are moments when I thought: “Alrighty, I’m getting it, you can stop now.” But I also laughed out loud and the story really stayed with me. A very different kind of story telling. Check it out.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Let me correct my last blog, I NEVER mentioned my wonderful daughter Khaili, I truly missed not having her at the party, but I did know where she was, busy catching that softball flying across the base:)\r\n    Great bloging staff, I am so proud of you all.\r\n    Morgan, thanks for checking back in with Angie about the water shutting off. Craig with Vanderyacht Propane will be here first thing in the morning, he will be showing Seth and Regino how to turn the propane off over by where they will be digging under bldg C to correct the leak.\r\n    Morgan, could you please call Pepsi about the new face plate for the pepsi machine over by the pool, I know you may already have done so, but just keep at them.\r\n    Champagne, has anybody ordered more for ELEMENTS? I noticed we were getting kinda low.\r\n    Happy Mom’s day..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 3:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Khaili, I think Wednesday will be fine, it’s only a small group. Good luck with your game!\r\n    Happy MD everybody:)\r\n    Esspike Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 3:00 pm\r\n\r\n    Dear ELEMENTS staff,\r\n    I wanted to say thank you for the big porky bone I got from the Fiesta pig. It made me hear so much better. As opposed to hearing: bla bla bla esspike bla bla, I heard: Come here, Esspike, stop digging in the garden. Amazing.\r\n    If there is ever something I can do to help: I’m an excellent deer and fox chaser, I eat spiders and I can mouse. And sometimes I wake up when somebody is at the door.\r\n    Porky bone for everyone!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 2:43 pm\r\n\r\n    BLOG BLOG BLOG\r\n    Low key day today. I informed Angie that water may be shut off at some point during the next 2 days. She’s ok with it just make sure we give her a warning before we do it.\r\n    That’s about it.\r\n\r\n    Happy Mothers Day!\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    May 11th, 2008 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    I am bummed that I missed out on the fiesta yesterday :( I heard that it was great. We did win our softball game, so our team is going on to tri-districts. Yay! Unfortunately that means that I will not be able to work with Tory on Wednesday. Sorry Tory!\r\n    Happy Mothers day to all of you mothers! I got a little taste of motherhood this weekend thanks to the Ready-Or-Not-Tot(baby doll that cries and all that good stuff) that I babysat for one of my friends. It cried too often and was a lot more work than expected. I can’t even imagine what it would be like to have an actual baby. All of you mothers are amazing!\r\n    Everything is going smoothly at the office. Not much happening but we do have an elderhostel group that should be here soon. Morgan and I have all of the invoices and keys ready so we are good to go!\r\n    Have a great week! See you next Sunday. (And wish my softball team luck for our tournament on Wednesday. It’s “do or die” so if we lose our games, our season is done! :( )\r\n    Khaili\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 10:23 pm\r\n\r\n    our early elderhostel guest showed up.\r\n    good luck tomorrow!\r\n    happy mothers day laura, cindy, gio, raquel, and all the other housekeepers.\r\n    steffi, you and i are missing out on all the glory and personal questions of motherhood ;) hehe i think i can wait on that though.\r\n    priscilla\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Tory, Gio and Khaili…we missed you today.\r\n    Raquel and Regino…you are AMAZING. What great food.\r\n    Thank you everyone for making our second annual May Fiesta a great event.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    Wonderful party, we missed Tory and Gio, where were you??? You missed Raquel’s yummy food, and Adam’s great margarita’s. Thanks to all the staff for making today a fun day. The mexican dancing was spectacular, and Brian made rolling the kayak look easy.. It was fun. I can’t wait until next year. :)\r\n    Steffi\r\n    I had put Khaili on the schedule to help on Wednesday, but since she won her softball game today, they are going to play in Tacoma on Wednesday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 6:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, what a nice party. Thank you so much, Raquel, for the fabulous food, and Adam & Laura for making the party happen.\r\n\r\n    #1130542\r\n    This is a weird one. Elderhostel early arrival, but not on Elderhostel list for tomorrow. I looked through our rooming lists from Elderhostel and the guest was on there. So at this point I’m not sure if that guest is coming, canceled, or if we made a mistake. We will play it by ear. If guest shows up tonight, all is good, if not, please cancel tonights reservation and tomorrows EH reservation.\r\n\r\n    BUILDING C\r\n    Some guests had lukewarm & rusty water, could be from our water crisis. If a guest in that building has issues and complains, please move and accommodate.\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 3:04 pm\r\n\r\n    hey everyone,\r\n    the cinqo de mayo party is about to start..food, fun, dancing , margaritas!!! not one you want to miss :)\r\n    priscilla\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 10th, 2008 at 8:26 am\r\n\r\n    Please make sure every employee working the front desk writes in the blog at least once during their shift. Maybe for those that blog often there will be a ________????\r\n    As the season gets busier, it is SO important to communicate via the employee blog, otherwise we are all lost. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE blog all details. If you are ever unsure if something is a new issue or an old issue, I will never mind being called, if an outside repair person comes in for information and you don’t know, have them call Steffi or I.\r\n    Get ready for YUMMY Raquel treats.\r\n    Happy party.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 6:38 pm\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    will be arriving this Sunday. It’s just a handful of guests and they will be arriving individually. Please print out invoices (suppress pricing!) and make keys in advance anyway on Sunday morning. Please make sure Regino is on call for rides from the ferry. Last time pretty much everyone arrived on the 3:50 ferry and Khaili and I had quite a rush.\r\n    Same on Wednesday. Khaili, it would be fabulous if you could come and help Tory from 3.30 to 8.30. Gio, please print invoices and make keys in the morning.\r\n    Thank you guys!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 4:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone, Please if you have any questions about the leak in building C and B, call me. Thanks so much…\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 12:26 pm\r\n\r\n    WATER ISSUES\r\n    A new leak was found under the foundation slab on building C. All rooms in Buildings B & C are now closed out until Thursday. Those who have previously made bookings in the Sky Places for the weekend may still stay there but that’s it. Hopefully the buildings will be reopened by Wednesday but we are uncertain at this point. Further updates as we know them.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 9th, 2008 at 8:20 am\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA CLIPPER\r\n    WOO HOO! Got our first Victoria Clipper block release in the fax this morning. All y’all who don’t know what I am talking about come see me. Do it. Do it. This is a new procedure to most of you and it’s something we will have to deal with every morning for the rest of the summer.\r\n\r\n    LEAK\r\n    Regino says that Rob should be here this morning to repair the broken pipe. Hopefully we should have water back in B & C by tomorrow. Seeing as though you have to let the pipe glue cure before putting pressure on it. (Again just my uninformed idea)\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 9:19 pm\r\n\r\n    I just noticed that the two reservations are unirez bookings and we have no contact info to handle the situation. I will leave this up to Morgan to deal with in the morning. Thanks Morgan. I don’t think it will be too much of a fiasco. This evening has just flown by. I feel the season coming soon. So nice out today. I even wore flip flops to work today…I know who cares. Blog Blog Blog!\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Just wanted to say that tonight went realllly smooth! Always is when Tory is working! So about moving the guests around, I was thinking that moving them around and not telling them isn’t right! Hopefully the water is going to be turned back on by the time guests want to check in….so this unfortunately means that all the guests that requested king rooms cant have one, and also all cabana’s are booked. ARRrgghhh. Phones have been really busy tonight. I feel like crying :( I’ll figure something out. If the all the rooms are not completely move then the morning person needs to follow up and call the guests, and move then THANK YOU!! Good night~\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Building B & C have been blocked out until further notice when the plumbing situation is handled. Phones have been busy this evening. There are a few checkins in those buildings and they will need to be moved in the A.M. There are two reservations left that need to be moved if the water issue is not resolved by the time of checkin.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Bldg C\r\n    Leak is found, great job all you hard leak finders:) The leak should be fixed by tomorrow.\r\n    314\r\n    New toliet will be installed first thing Friday am, please make sure housekeeping goes in afterwards, we have a guest checking into that room tomorrow.\r\n    Thanks so MUCH,, I am a happy camper now that the leak has been found..\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 8th, 2008 at 8:49 am\r\n\r\n    Blog\r\n    Let’s make sure that every shift on the front desk writes in the blog. Even if it is just to say all okay..\r\n    Leak\r\n    Bldg C has a leak under it, we believe it is underground, it is not effecting anything with the building, just wasting water, which is NOT okay. The Town of FH will be here today, to use their handy dandy underground leak detector. I will let you know the outcome.\r\n    314\r\n    A new toilet is going to be installed in 314, this should resolve the clogging toilet issue, the flushing mechanism was not working properly.\r\n    PARTY PARTY\r\n    Don’t miss Saturday’s bash, 3-7pm…\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 7th, 2008 at 1:27 pm\r\n\r\n    The blog was feeling very lonely lately so I decided to do something worthy (barely)of blogging about.\r\n\r\n    I put Seth’s number in speed dial on all of the front desk phones. Yes, he loves me now.\r\n\r\n    Also, I put the San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau webervations availability calendar on the Firefox (internet) toolbar so that when someone calls looking for a website and we don’t have availability, you can check what else is open.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 8:29 pm\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN PR\r\n    The next time a guest calls for a nice stay in Puerto Rico, refer them to my friend’s B & B Casa Islena in Rincon. Casa Islena is run by my friend Lauren’s sister. Lauren & Brendan, who both worked for me in Oly run the Tapas Bar in the place. It’s right on the beach and gorgeous. Check it out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 5:30 pm\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON RATES\r\n    Don’t forget that we are charging summer rates Fridays and Saturdays from now on\r\n\r\n    FIESTA FOOD\r\n    Morgan, please get with Raquel tomorrow and order food for our Fiesta uh la la, caramba, ole! Also: please ask Sysco what they have in stock for ORGANIC fruit. If they have something other than oranges and apples (we have lots), buy it please (like strawberries, bananas, cantaloupe or kiwis)\r\n\r\n    R & R\r\n    will both be off island on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    We have a bit of a problem with our washers. They backed up (the commercial ones, not the guest ones) under building C. Regino is pumping the water out in the alley and will try to snake the drain tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I had the first overflowing toilet of the season. Yeah, Spring!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 4th, 2008 at 3:28 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    The elevator leading to the conference room has finally stopped working. I believe the problem lies with the second floor safety mechanism. I took apart the cover plate so I could look at the lock innards and here is what I saw: When the button is pressed to go between floors, a solenoid moves a metal plate down over the lock prong on the door. When the plate is fully seated two buttons, attached to the plate, are pressed by the lock prong. On top of that security there is a small mirror attached to the door. What looks like a infrared emitter is inside the locking mechanism. I think it shines on to the mirror and then reads the return signal to determine if the door is fully shut or not. Rather complicated no? With the lock plate opened I could see that the plate was moving fine and that the buttons should be making a connection. I think that perhaps either the infrared emitter bulb or the receiver may be burnt out. That is just my uninformed opinion. Either way we probably need to call ye olde elevator repair person to take a look. We have a lady with us for Elderhostel who could really use that elevator but she says she’ll get by.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    May 3rd, 2008 at 4:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi, I’m looking for a room on the beach…do you speak English there? How big is the city? Do you know how long the flight is from Miami? What, you’re not in Puerto Rico? Well, where the heck is San Juan Island, Washington? And why would I want to go there?\r\n\r\n    No, I’m not back yet, but almost. I’m stuck in Portland (weather’s too bad for Adam to fly down and get me). I should be able to come home tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    I survived my trip to Panama & Costa Rica. And, thankfully, so did my grandfather. Lots of stories. I’ll be boring you over teh next few weeks with some of them. Just smile and nod.\r\n\r\n    As the Panamanians say…Ciao!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2008 at 8:32 am\r\n\r\n    8:29am May 2, 2008\r\n    Got another Puerto Rico call. From a different person this time. She said that we come up when she searched for lodging in San Juan. I’ll check it out.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    May 2nd, 2008 at 8:21 am\r\n\r\n    7:57am May 2, 2008\r\n    Had my first “Puerto Rico” call of the season. Almost got to start booking a room before she mentioned something that sounded a bit…off. I love those calls. They make me laugh.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    May 1st, 2008 at 8:37 am\r\n\r\n    We have a guest that checked out today# 1042884 that came in this morning letting us know that she has lost her ring. She may have lost it at the Bistro Garden, or around town. I have called the Bistro informing them to call us if they find it. Also I called the sheriff’s office letting them know to call us as well. The description of the ring is: Three different golds(yellow white and rose) all inter twined together. The guest says it’s a bigger ring style…so just giving everyone a heads up ;)\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    May 1st, 2008 at 8:35 am\r\n\r\n    Hi there,\r\n    Elena the lamp that was by the coffee service is over in the sitting area, that lamp had a broken plug, you mom is replacing the plug (she is such a women of many hats :)\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    GIO\r\n    I made the signs for Raquel so you don’t need to anymore\r\n\r\n    OUR LAMP IS MISSING IN ACTION\r\n    does anyone know where the lamp that used to be on the coffee area console has gone?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    STEFFI MESSAGES\r\n    Sweeties, since I’m all over the place right now, have to talk to lot’s of people and don’t have a cell phone, I depend solely on you to make sure people can reach me. When people try to contact me, please let them know that currently my days off are Monday & Tuesday. Then please look at the schedule and tell them when I’m where. If somebody wants to leave a message, either transfer to my phone ext.3002 or write me an email. Just say “no” to sticky notes. You think they are your friends but they really aren’t.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 30th, 2008 at 9:19 am\r\n\r\n    Diamond Bracelet was found, the captain that brought them over from the mainland from the tennis bracelet in the head of his boat when he was emptying it. Thank goodness he was looking..\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 29th, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    CHOCOLATES\r\n    Nevermind. Found them in the water-cooler’s mini-fridge.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 29th, 2008 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    995921\r\n    The guest from reservation #995921 did finally call and cancel. Poor thing sounded horrible over the phone. That’s got to suck. Having that happen mid-flight on your way to your honeymoon. She asked us to ship anything that arrived for her to their address. So we need to send off the card and the box of chocolates. Seeing as the chocolates were already paid for by her sister. Well I guess we can get that stuff off to her and try to salvage what little of their honeymoon as we can. A small “Honeymoon-In-A-Box” if you will. I set a completed Post San Juan form and the card on the back desk. I can’t seem to find where the chocolates went. Any ideas? PSJ doesn’t have a alcohol license so they can’t ship the champagne. *COUGH*Unless we package it up for them and don’t tell them what’s in it.*COUGH* Well that’s about it. Laters!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 28th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Reservation #8788, lost a tennis bracelet while they were on their way to dinner last night. I have called the sheriffs office and the restaurant to see if it was turned in, it was not. Please contact me with any questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 8:21 pm\r\n\r\n    WEDDING GROUP\r\n    O.K. here is the deal: at 9AM tomorrow, Dan from SJ transit and his employee will come here with 2 buses. One will take the party on an island tour and drop them off at Roche. the other will be loaded by Regino (please call him, he knows) and then will go to Roche and drop the luggage off. Great!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 7:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Miss GIO\r\n    Good morning, gorgeous!\r\n    We have a wedding party here (see itinerary on back desk), who got kind of screwed by their travel agency (not enough information, loose ends, etc.) So, please be super nice and helpful. At 9AM SJ Transit will pick them up for an island tour and drop them off at Roche Harbor to leave the island from there. What we (the wedding group and I) can’t figure out is: how is SJ transit going to get 21 people in their tiny bus, plus the luggage?\r\n    So, at 9, when SJ transit comes, please get with the transit guy and Regino and figure out how we can make it easiest for this party. Maybe Regino will load our van and drive the luggage to Roche Harbor for them. The boat starts loading in Roche Harbor at 11 AM, they’ll leave at noon.\r\n    SJ transit:800-887-8387\r\n    Skip, the captain of the Koinonia: 360-293-5920\r\n    Thank you. Have a great beginning of the week!\r\n\r\n    Mr. MORGAN\r\n    Please go to the bank to get change tomorrow. Thank you for all your hard work and holding the ship down while I’m rocking the Bird. See you next week.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 27th, 2008 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    STEPS\r\n    New menus are in most rooms, Morgan will put the remaining ones in tomorrow. Please note: STEPS is no longer allowed to sell beer & wine to-go, since they applied for a hard liquor license. So it’s food only for us.\r\n\r\n    342\r\n    the door is dead, doesn’t blink, doesn’t lock (it’s just open), no key gets it to do anything. I moved the guests and blocked out the room. Please let Seth know to check it out.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 26th, 2008 at 11:46 am\r\n\r\n    MAPS\r\n    Luckily for ELEMENTS we have a box of maps down here at Bird Rock from last season that, I guess we could share with you guys if we HAVE to. I will bring them by later today.\r\n    sees ya\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 7:11 pm\r\n\r\n    FERRIES ON JULY 4\r\n    Members,\r\n    As most of you are aware, the Sealth will be in service over the 4th of July\r\n    weekend, which carries approximately 50 cars less per sailing. Since this\r\n    is our busiest weekend of the year, the Ferry Advisory Committee (FAC) has\r\n    been talking with WSF regarding a solution. WSF has agreed to provide free\r\n    parking for walk-ons at the Anacortes terminal over the dates of July 3-7.\r\n    Please let guests booking with you over those dates know this by encouraging\r\n    them to walk on the ferry for the weekend. You might also want to post this\r\n    info on your website, etc.\r\n\r\n    As you know, there’s shuttle service on San Juan and Orcas Islands during\r\n    that time, and the FAC is working on transportation options for Lopez\r\n    Island. I’ll keep you posted via e-mail.\r\n\r\n    Deborah Hopkins\r\n    Executive Director\r\n    San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Oh able one! SJ transit called, they are also out of maps.\r\n    G + I are chipping away at the Elderhostel rooming lists, can you please keep working on them, since I’ll be Bird Rock heavy next week.\r\n    Thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    BEWARE OF THE DATE\r\n    Oh guys, we had a bad one today #1109274. The lady called to inform us that after having been here for 2 nights, nobody ever came to tidy her room. We were on the phone to Raquel immediately, who showed us the HK report and there was nobody booked in that room. We called the lady back and asked for her name, found her and she was checked in, only for March 2008. Because she is here for 4 nights, I had to move other people out of the way to keep her in that room for her current stay. Not the end of the world, but can you image that in July, we checking somebody into an empty room when there is actually somebody in there? So, the reservation was a walk-in and one of us probably had WRP on a different date. It happens, but we can’t afford it. Please please double check the date, especially when booking a walk-in. Thank you.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 10:48 am\r\n\r\n    THANKS MORGAN,\r\n    Thank you for the write up on the HOLD ROOMS…\r\n    IMPORTANT DISCOUNT INFORMATION\r\n    Please see group # 10096\r\n    Everyone calling in for this event is to get 10% off the rack rate. Please read the notes in the note section\r\n    All San Juan Island Marathon guest will receive a 10% off rack rate special.\r\n    Cinco De Mayo for ELEMENTS, May 10, 3pm to 7pm, be there or you know be SQUARE… If you don’t show up you will miss Ms. Raquels yummy food.\r\n    Housekeeping\r\n    We are going to have a housekeeping meeting on May 22 at 2pm, please any front desk employee’s that have anything they would like me to address at the meeting, I would appreciate any emails with this information. It works well to have us all lending our opinions on how to make our wonderful place run even smoother.\r\n    BIKES BIKES BIKES\r\n    It is the time for us to ALWAYS have the bikes out, and remember to put them away in the evening. I was thrilled to see a couple taking off on the beach cruisers this morning as I walked into the office at 8:15am, what a beautiful day for a bike ride.\r\n    Overseas Employee’s\r\n    We will be greeting our first couple of Bulgarian employee’s on the 28th of May, let’s remember to give them a HUGE San Juan Island greeting.\r\n    That’s it for now… Smile, Smile, Smile.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 25th, 2008 at 10:17 am\r\n\r\n    *IMPORTANT* BLOCKED OUT ROOMS *IMPORTANT*\r\n    Ok all. If you start taking a look at the calendar you will see up to eight rooms blocked out every day June – August. They are just blocked out via the “UNIT CLOSEOUTS” screen. Four of these rooms are held especially for Victoria Clipper Reservations. Vic. Clip. ALWAYS gets Earth Places. Any other closed out rooms are our “Emergency Hold” rooms for the summer. Emergency Hold rooms are held in place in case of overbooking (highly unlikely), online reservations with wrong dates (highly likely), and maintenance issues. Our job is to make sure we hold these rooms until the last minute and then try to sell them if everything is going ok. Depending on availability, Cindy, Laura, Adam, Steffi, or myself will release these rooms if it looks like we won’t sell-out a given day. The big thing is to never let these rooms be held if we could otherwise sell-out on any given day. I know this sounds complicated but talk to me if you have questions.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 2:32 pm\r\n\r\n    UNIT MAINTENANCE\r\n    Please remember, when marking a room out of service, to:\r\n    1) write the rooms numbers\r\n    2) the reason the rooms are closed\r\n    3) your initials\r\n    4) the date\r\n    in the unit maintenance description section.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 1:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Marathon May 31st, 2008\r\n    All people attending the SJ Marathon, is welcome to a 10% discount of our regular rack rate. This discount is valid whether you are arriving on Friday or staying until Monday.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 8:02 am\r\n\r\n    P.S. Congratulations, Gio. Motherhood just keeps getting better and better once the babe sleeps through the night. That is until they start learning the words “no”, “mine”, and “why”. At least when that starts you’ll be well rested!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 24th, 2008 at 8:01 am\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n    I just posted a note on the Bird Rock blog regarding TripAdvisor and I realized that this information, while not specifically directed to Elements, could be very useful for all of us. Please read this post and also all of our past reviews on TripAdvisor. Figure out ways that YOU can make our guest experiences better.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!!\r\n    Laura\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 23rd, 2008 at 8:18 pm\r\n\r\n    We have a couple coming for their honeymoon#995921. Just making sure if anyone ordered the chocolates??!! If not please make that an alarm or a reminder for a priority today. And remember to put their champagne in the room for them. They are arriving on the ferry that gets in @2:40ish here. Thanks!! This was a really quite night! 6 check ins. Rather cold tonight. I have done all I can do for the evening. You know…..I think I forgot what getting a good night sleep was like!!! I had like a sleep hangover for a couple of days. My babe FINALLY has the sleep thing down! Whoop whoop! Ha I’m crazy…\r\n    Cindy: I made an Alarm, but I need to talk about a guest that needs a refund with company card. Really confusing but I can elaborate a little for yah! Goooooooood night everyone.zzzzzzzzzz\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 22nd, 2008 at 12:43 pm\r\n\r\n    Great job everyone. Everything is looking great. Thanks everyone for not parking out in the front area. :)\r\n    Bikes\r\n    Let’s remember to put the bikes out every morning. Whoever is opening will put them out.\r\n    Fan in pool area\r\n    Never turn the fans off. If anyone notices that there is condensation on the windows please let me know ASAP..\r\n    Heater in exercise room\r\n    The breaker is off for the heater in the exercise room, please leave it off. For now it appears that the sliding door into the room does not have to be left closed because our dehumidification system is working fine.\r\n    Steffo\r\n    All deposits have been paid and applied to both of the upcoming groups(that we discussed yesterday)\r\n    Trip Advisor\r\n    Every guest that checks out you need to say: “how was your stay with us?” please encourage all guest to write a review on Trip Advisor or ELEMENTS website. We love all feedback.\r\n    Gift Shop\r\n    The gift shop looks great, thank you Morgan and Khaili for putting out all the extra inventory, and remember all ELEMENTS stuff is 30% off.\r\n    You all rock, thanks for all your hard work.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:46 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS!!! w00t! (take that bird rock ;p )\r\n\r\n    LATE ARRIVAL\r\n    Reservation #1107066 was a late check-in. He knows to bring a signed copy of the invoice into the office in the morning.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK GUEST FOLDERS\r\n    Laura, I have scoured the back computer here and I sadly can find no files relating to the guest folders. Didn’t all that stuff get made up by that advertising company? Come to think of it, I think the pages to be proof-read were kept on Cindy’s computer. I seem to remember the pages with our information were sent to her. I hope that’s right. :)\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Dave did some work to temporarily fix the pool electrical until the time he can get a new main shipped here and installed. So far the pool and the jacuzzi seem to be running nicely together. Let us hope it stays that way.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL\r\n    – Lots o’ walk-in tonight. Mostly our favorite Timberland Homes guys. I just don’t understand why their office doesn’t set up a direct bill account with us.\r\n    – A card has arrived for a guest who is arriving on the 28th. We need to put it in their room along with some champagne they ordered. Reservation #995921. The card is posted on the front desk dry-erase board.\r\n    – Two bags of coffee arrived from the roasting company. At the guy’s suggestion I put one of the bags in the refrigerator. The guy who does the roasting says it will keep a bit better in there.\r\n\r\n    That’s about it. See’z you all tomorrow.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG IS NOW UP AND RUNNING!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 9:03 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK:\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG: Adam is in range of a computer and will work on the blog so that we can have that up and running (maybe even by tonight).\r\n\r\n    MUSIC: Adam will pick up stereo components so we should have music by Thursday, yeah!\r\n\r\n    TRIP ADVISOR: Now that we have guests, and happy ones at that, it would be really great if we could start getting some of that feedback onto Tripadvisor or other travel web sites. So, please, if a guest says to you something nice about their stay (and this goes for you at ELEMENTS as well) please don’t be shy to say something like “Oh thank you so much, that’s great to hear. If you get a chance, it would help us a lot if you could post your comments on Tripadvisor.” See, easy (and it will really help us).\r\n\r\n    As always, thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 21st, 2008 at 6:53 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Yeah, ELEMENTONIANS, we Bird Rockers are so much more exciting right now. You might even call us “hot”!\r\n\r\n    TIMECARDS\r\n    Please keep them for now above the time clock.\r\n\r\n    WRP BACK UP EMAIL\r\n    Elena, I spoke with Cindy, WRP does not need to be backed up.\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n    OJ is not organic until Wednesday. Guests in San Juan suite will leave at 7 AM, I made them breakfast already, just to let you know, Famous Miss K.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please everybody, print out a housekeeping report in the morning and hang it on the clipboard above the safe.\r\n\r\n    WATER\r\n    I left 2 messages with the water delivery people. Please call them again if nothing happens tomorrow: 8-5218\r\n\r\n    MENU GUIDE\r\n    Found it! Tory, can I make that your job? Please update the menu guide, just like you did at E.\r\n\r\n    DAVE\r\n    Is on the coffee maker cable. Also: please let him know that according to the guests in the San Juan the jets in the bathtub turn on on their own, without water in it, that can’t be good.\r\n\r\n    CHRIS\r\n    Hooked up guest computer on first floor. Wireless is now working in lobby and on 1st floor. Password is BR phone number. He’ll be back tomorrow and work on time clock and second phone line.\r\n\r\n    TV\r\n    Laura will fix the TV in the Bainbridge tomorrow. I did not find the 4 back up remotes. Anybody?\r\n\r\n    KEYS\r\n    Have a call in to Kyle Wilson, key dude. I will make him make us keys which actually open the doors (what a concept). If he calls, tell him to catch me Thursday or leave me a message at E.\r\n\r\n    MARROWSTONE\r\n    Is all ready. Unfortunately some paint stains on the new carpet and sofa. Elena (who is working her buns off, thank you so much, bonita) will ask Raquel for spot removal wisdom.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2008 at 9:02 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n\r\n    JAVA: We have espresso machines! Regino found them today. I am very excited. Soon we’ll find the receiver and we’ll have music to go with our coffee.\r\n\r\n    PLANTS: The housekeepers will be responsible for taking care of the plants in the rooms and lobby. I met with Theresa (the plant lady) today and she said to water them no more than 1/2 cup once a week and then only if they feel dry. The plants should not need drip trays. She says she sealed them from the inside. Do keep a close eye on them, however, just to make sure they aren’t leaking or damaging the furniture.\r\n\r\n    TVs: I will call Brian at Digital Connex (our tv guy) to find out how to program the remotes and also to tell him about the Pay-per-view situation. We should have a box there with 4 extra remotes. Steffi, do you know where that is? Can you keep track of that?\r\n\r\n    ELECTRICAL ISSUES: Dave is waiting for one piece of track to come in and then he should be able to put up the pretty lobby lighting. I will also contact him on Monday about the fan/light (or lack thereof) in the Shaw. If you can think of any other electrical issues (other than for rooms 2 & 3) please let me know.\r\n\r\n    MANUALS: Great work, Steffi. I had been intending to talk to you about this, but I just kept forgetting. I was thinking that it might be a good idea to keep a backup copy of each of these manuals up at Elements, too.\r\n\r\n    BINDERS: Cindy, did you ask Morgan to get started on this project? Morgan, did you get started on this project?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 20th, 2008 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    I contacted the flower lady, she will check in on Thursday. If I’m not around, please show her our baby vases, tell her we have 15 rooms and ask how much it would cost to supply us with flowers for our breakfast trays.\r\n\r\n    Please check if the recycling has been picked up (I put 2 cans on curb). Please start recycling and let the housekeepers know as well. We can recycle: paper, carton, glass (no broken glasses or light bulbs), yogurt, milk & juice containers, soda cans. We can’t recycle: plastic bags, aluminum foil, batteries, paper towels & napkins.\r\n\r\n    I put the manuals for phone, TV remote & espresso makers in a tray on our desk, please leave there until we get file cabinet.\r\n\r\n    What’s the wireless sign in now, does anybody know?\r\n\r\n    I started a box of dishes in the kitchen, with stuff I think we have too much of or we don’t need. Please add to it, or take stuff back out and tell us why, so we can keep (or get) our space organized.\r\n\r\n    I looked for everybody’s time card today (payroll is tomorrow) and I only found Soco’s. Please, everybody, use time cards until we have the time clock hooked up. Keep them on top of the fire alarm for now.\r\n\r\n    I’ll check in with Cindy tomorrow at 2, then go shopping, I shouldn’t be later than 3. If Jerry from FSA checks in, have him contact me after 3.\r\n    Other than that, happy guests, sun is out, all is good.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2008 at 7:59 pm\r\n\r\n    PATTI WICKHAM\r\n    will stop by in the next couple of days and pick up a donation request (in my office with her name on it).\r\n\r\n    We had a couple of hours without internet today. Tory at Bird Rock checked people in for us. The wireless needed to be reset. Chris walked Morgan through it. All is good now.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK BLOG\r\n    All of us blogged on the BR website, but the blogs dissappear, different people see different blogs, trippy. So, for now, let’s use ELEMENTS blog for Bird Rock as well until Adam comes back and heals the website.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 19th, 2008 at 8:18 am\r\n\r\n    POOL UPDATE\r\n    Due to the imminent failure of the main breaker in the pool there is now some new information. As you may have heard, the main breaker that supplies power to the pool and jacuzzi pumps/heaters is going bad. That means it is steadily losing its ability to power both the heaters and the pumps for both areas at the same time. As of right now I am focusing on keeping the water hot in the jacuzzi. It seems more popular than the pool at the moment. The pool’s pump is on to provide filtration but it’s heater is off. This means that due to this unseasonable cold weather we are having, the temperature in the pool is dropping steadily. Hopefully Dave will have a chance to work on it soon. Please offer our apologies to anyone who requires it.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2008 at 10:28 pm\r\n\r\n    The gentleman in room #310 is not happy about the hot tub not being up to temp. So he will probably be coming into the office to change to a jetted tub suite if the hot tub is not hot enough.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 17th, 2008 at 6:20 pm\r\n\r\n    ERIKA SUNDSTROM\r\n    I allowed Erika to use our pool for a couple of months, 2 times per week (mornings and not on the weekends). She had a back injury and is having a baby soon. So just to let all of you know.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK KEYS\r\n    I made front door keys, which must be the most tedious undertaking in the universe (send me patience and strength, please). For now, nobody else should make those keys, please.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Please everybody check the pool and hot tub temperature at least once per shift and let Morgan know if the temperatures are low (hot tub under 100, pool under 70? Morgan?)\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    April 16th, 2008 at 12:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Please note a new special on the bird rock and elements websites: Sea/Sky or Sea + Sky. This package is a value added deal where we are just packaging our rooms with regular priced Outdoor Odysseys full day kayaking trip and dining credit: there is no discount, it is a convenience factor and a way for us to thank Clark at Outdoor Odysseys because he has brought us lots of web traffic (and presumably bookings) over the years. We also do not collect commission on this package.\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT NOTE: WRP is set up to scale this package automatically based on the number of nights and people in any given reservation. The trouble is that you and the guest MUST select the correct number of people or the pricing will be out of whack. I have tried to make this clear in the special description, but please be on the lookout for anything that looks funky (like, maybe a booking with package charges for just one person—that’s possible but less likely than two).\r\n\r\n    Good to go?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 15th, 2008 at 9:56 pm\r\n\r\n    LEISURE ISLAND TOURS\r\n    Well somebody sure had their wires crossed. They showed up in their own tour bus. Regino and I moved all their luggage for them without incident. The baggage handling fee has been added to their group folio. We will just have to pick up their luggage and take it to the bus on Thursday.\r\n    REGINO\r\n    He is in 321 for the overnights.\r\n    OTHER\r\n    Busy night tonight. A lot of folks needing help with things. Kept me running out the door most of the night. Gio cleaned up the exercise equipment and she and I moved everything back into the work-out room. All we need now is to have everything plugged back in and the shelves hung up again. We should probably think about picking up some replacement weights. I have had to throw so many of them away because kids took them into the pool and they rusted like crazy. Well that’s about it. I am going to try and sleep in tomorrow but let me know if you need anything, like and off-island run, or if the pool gives you problems.\r\n    Laters!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 14th, 2008 at 7:04 pm\r\n\r\n    IN-BOXES\r\n    Any invoices, everything which has to do with money, regardless of the name on the invoice goes in Cindy’s in-box. Everything regarding groups, again, don’t matter to whom it is addressed, goes in my in-box. All chocolate also goes in my in-box!\r\n\r\n    CINDY\r\n    If you have a chance, can you chat with Morgan about how we’ll handle Bird Rock keys?\r\n    LEISURE ISLAND TOUR\r\n    will arrive tomorrow at 4.30. Regino will pick them up (please remind him) from the port (specify where they arrive). Morgan will make rooming list. Keys and invoices (suppress pricing) can be prepared after noon tomorrow. They’ll depart Thursday at 9.30, again Regino will drive them back to their boat.\r\n\r\n    Have a productive, sane couple of days, everybody. Let me know if you need me (to go off island or something).\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 13th, 2008 at 6:59 pm\r\n\r\n    CASH\r\n    Guys, I just reconciled cash and we had some snafus. WRP does not give back change. When a guest owes us for example $0.27 for a stamp and pays with a fifty, don’t put in $50 in WRP. If you do, the system shows us owing $49.73. You’ll have to enter $0.27 and make change in your head. So we better all go to calculator school real quick.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK TUBS\r\n    Morgan and I took a field trip to BR, looking fancy in there. We found that the aerated tubs in the Orca and the San Juan are one person tubs, not two person tubs like in the rest of the superior rooms. Laura thinks we should just advertise “tubs” in either case and not specify the size of the tub. So please do so.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK OPENING\r\n    Will be Friday, 4/18 at 10.30 AM. K, E & T, please be there.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home wonderful boss people! We missed you!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 12th, 2008 at 4:38 pm\r\n\r\n    DEMETER BAKERY\r\n    made our little front desk and housekeeping hearts jump today by bringing chocolate-banana, ginger-lemon & seed muffins over, a whole tray full. Oh so good. I love it when people feed us. We are always so hungry. Well, Tory and I anyway.\r\n\r\n    CONFERENCE CENTER ONITY DOOR\r\n    doesn’t open. Seth knows and will fix it next week\r\n\r\n    It’s Spring, finally!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 12th, 2008 at 1:15 pm\r\n\r\n    ELEVATOR\r\n    We really need to figure out what is happening with it. It is really finicky. You can ride it up and down a couple of times and then suddenly it will decide not to work anymore. Or conversely it won’t work at all at first and then you come back later and it all of a sudden works. Do we need to have the elevator company do a complete overhaul? I know the thing doesn’t get used much but it is a real asset for the Elderhostel attendees and people renting the conference room who have elderly/cargo.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 5:42 pm\r\n\r\n    H2O\r\n    Morgan, Interisland water will bring by some water on Saturday, before noon.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 4:44 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL HOUSE\r\n    Ok. The pool house is up and running. The water is a bit cold still. The Jacuzzi heats about 5 degrees every couple of hours. At 4:30pm it was about 85. It should be fully heated by later this evening. The pool is another matter. It is such a large, cold mass that it takes much longer to heat even though it has a larger heater. It raises about 5 degrees every 12 hours or so. Probably a little less. It is currently rounding 70 degrees so if should be up to full heat sometime Saturday evening. (I hope). Once the temp in the pool is up we can activate the new heater/dehumidifier. Everybody keep your fingers crossed so that we don’t have something unexpected happen again that would lengthen our time line (again). :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 1:39 pm\r\n\r\n    CLOSING\r\n    Yes, please everybody, go by the closing list in our front desk folders and double check that you are good to go. I do it every time, still.\r\n\r\n    ORCA CONFERENCE CENTER\r\n    When booking the Orca room, please include in the guest remarks:\r\n    1) WHEN the event will take place, as in: what time of the day\r\n    2) OCCASION, is it a wedding, a funeral, a dance work shop?\r\n    3) Extremely specific info about the room set up, over-explain, and create an alarm for the day before, so we can set it up correctly.\r\n    I think we have a class there today and a memorial tomorrow, don’t know what times of the day. So please be flexible and jump when it’s jumping time.\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Ladies & Gentlemen: the building is open! All lamps are installed (we have a couple left over in luggage room), everything looks good. 338 needs art. 341 has a loose tile behind entrance door and needs a face plate in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n    GROUPS\r\n    Cindy, Laura, Morgan & Steff: when promising a special deal for a group of people (for example: participants of the scenic byways conference or a wedding with no room allocation), let’s create a group folio with nothing but a note in it, saying how much the rooms are. This way all of us can look up Group Folios for the date of arrival and then we all know about extra special deals. What do you think?\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:56 am\r\n\r\n    Oops, I left my cell phone at my hotel today. If anyone needs to get a hold of me urgently today, call me on Adam’s cell phone.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:56 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi, I think your idea of just shopping locally for Bird Rock is probably fine. Just keep in mind that if the weather is decent, we could pick up a few last minute bookings.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    April 11th, 2008 at 10:05 am\r\n\r\n    PLEASE, PLEASE\r\n    Remember always when closing that you are responsible for securing everything for the night, When I came in this morning one of the cash drawers was unlocked and the safe was wide open, coffee had not been emptied please try to remember, Thank you\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 7:00 pm\r\n\r\n    101\r\n    will be rented this weekend with a quick fix to the ceiling from Seth. After that we blocked it out for some serious ceiling patching.\r\n\r\n    211\r\n    is blocked out for a week, we are waiting for a faucet for the tub.\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock Food\r\n    I ordered Champagne (2 cases small, 1 case big) for BR from Market Chef. When they call, please get check from Cindy and bring Champagne to BR.\r\n    I ordered our old scone mix from FSA. Jerry will bring it by ELEMENTS on Monday.\r\n    I think I won’t do a large food order for the opening, but rather go shopping locally the Thursday before we open to get us through the weekend. I don’t want to risk buying large quantities of things and then not having a proper place to put them. What do you all think?\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 2:33 pm\r\n\r\n    FYI The Lavendera Day spa is closed this Sunday/Monday for “spring cleaning”\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 2:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Just let ya’ll know…Room 201 is being blocked off until the 15th. Reason being is that apparently the leak from the bath is so bad that it leaks like a water fall right above the sink in 101!! We had to move a couple of really nice ladies today. They understood that things just happen, and not for us or them to worry. Very nice people. Anyhoo.. I sent Seth to work on in it ASAP. He will keep us posted and up to date! Wheew! :/\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 10th, 2008 at 12:10 pm\r\n\r\n    Coast to Coast graphics shipment has arrived. Yeah!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 9th, 2008 at 9:39 pm\r\n\r\n    There was something a little fishy about our e-mail this evening. E-mails not coming in…I had an on line reservation show up in new bookings but not in outlook.\r\n\r\n    Whales were sighted by Maya today again. They have room tomorrow and friday. The hot tub and pool are still heating. There was a glitch with the electrical system back there (morgan has details) and to make a long story short…the pool has to heat before the hot tub can heat…so the hot tub is still out of service. The pool is heating very s-l-o-w-l-y. We did have a couple of very cute young customers go in for a dip. There was much squeeling and giggling and yelping. I don’t think they stayed in very long.\r\n\r\n    I had a guest call and say that their message light was blinking. Wow. I never learned how that worked. Can someone fill me in? Can people call and leave guests voice mail? If so…how will the next guest not get the same message if the first person does not retrieve it?\r\n\r\n    I am working on getting photos in all of building D. I had to order some more paper and it should be here in the next two days. FYI. Then I will be checking out all the other rooms and re-arranging and making sure all the photos match the “theme”\r\n\r\n    Oh, and by the time my “chocolate” capris get here…I probably won’t have any more shifts. Go figure.\r\n\r\n    Did you know they finally have life photos of the Giant Squid taken last year? cool hugh?\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    Regino is staying in 320 for two days. Had a really wild night with some walk-ins. Boosin’ folks ;) Wow. The night is over and not a thing left to do. Have a good mornin.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    J Pod again today! They came down the West Side from the North this morning. We left them this afternoon headed south near Hein Bank.\r\n\r\n    Maya has a trip tomorrow at 10 AM and 1:00 PM with room.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    COAST TO COAST GRAPHICS\r\n    Hopefully a gentleman named Sam will call and want to give us a FedEx tracking number. That number should correspond to 3 boxes of new Bird Rock letterhead, envelopes, and business cards. He said that they arrived today and that someone signed for it. No one here has any recollection of these boxes arriving. Hopefully we can use this tracking number to determined who signed for them. Thanks!!\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 12:46 pm\r\n\r\n    what i learned today….\r\n    we use natural cleaning products….that have an orange fragrance. We have hypo-allergenic bedding and synthetic goose down pillows. We use propane gas to heat our water and electric heaters for our room heat.\r\n\r\n    If we book the WIND PLACE we need to know how they want the beds set up…EVEN if its booked on line. It is a “booking option” and we need to get clarification on it. The Orca storage room key is NOT the same as the Orca conference room key.\r\n\r\n    We have to go into the reservations to double check them when we are printing them from on-line reservations. The pool looks to be up and running tomorrow. Just very cold.\r\n\r\n    When we make new keys for existing checkins…it deletes all other cards for that room.\r\n\r\n    And….it seems like we are doing a whole lot more work up here at the front desk than we used to.\r\n    cheers\r\n    kj\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 8th, 2008 at 10:02 am\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PRINCE\r\n    They have a trip going out today and Thursday at noon.\r\n    FERRIES\r\n    They seem to be having some trouble so the 11:05 to Anacortes has been canceled. The 1:45 to Ana. is still go though because it came from Sidney. The 9:30 from Ana. was canceled and the jury is still out on whether or not the 2:45 from Ana. will be canceled as well. Apparently the Hyak has developed steering problems. Is it just me or have the ferries been breaking down A LOT more in the past year than usual. You’d think with the amount of money they charge us to get here they could afford ferry upkeep or at least a new boat or two. ARRRRR!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 5:20 pm\r\n\r\n    Susan Matthews\r\n    will stop by tomorrow to have a look at the conference center. Please call Elderhostel and make sure they aren’t in and then show her the room. If she is interested in renting it for her Thursday event, give it to her for $100\r\n\r\n    116\r\n    needs an alarm clock, please let Raquel know.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Morgan worked on the hot tub all day. It is done & currently heating up. Painters are almost done. Dave & sons are currently connecting the fans. Regino pressure washed the floor.\r\n    Tomorrow Jared will take the platform down, Morgan will vacuum and clean the pool, voila!\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    Elena hung lists on every room door, describing the furniture going in those rooms. Regino & the girls are assembling away, prioritizing the rooms we will rent first.\r\n    Tory assembled BR keys. I made a food order list, have a meeting with FSA on Thursday, and will make sure we have ingredients on the 18th. Dwight will do the Marrowstone hot tub on Thursday.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 3:52 pm\r\n\r\n    ONITY\r\n    Tomorrow some Onity tech will call. He/She will want us to hook up the key making machine to the phone line. We have to use the line going into the fax machine because it doesn’t go through the regular phone system. Take the phone line out of the fax and plug it into the back of the key machine. Then follow the instructions from the Onity tech person. Call my cell phone when they call if you need help.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 7th, 2008 at 9:01 am\r\n\r\n    Aargh…I think I’m having work withdrawals. Okay, maybe not. The weather here in San Diego is chilly by their standards and delightful by ours. I know, I know, I’m too lucky for words.\r\n\r\n    BOXES-Just a reminder that when packages come in, whether they come to the front office or get delivered back to Raquel, please let me know what has arrived. I’m anxiously awaiting several items…\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK-I’ve been looking through the reservations and this spring, while we’re still so new, I would like you guys to please upgrade guests on arrival, space permitting.\r\n\r\n    I will bring back a little sunshine for all of you. If there’s anything else you want, let me know.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 6th, 2008 at 3:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Rats, I wanted Mr. Esspike to work my shift tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    BANK\r\n    Elena, please go to the bank first chance tomorrow morning. Deposit is in safe.\r\n\r\n    CLOCKING IN\r\n    Tomorrow morning we all clock in again, yippieh!\r\n\r\n    KULTURE KORNER\r\n    La musica: Ever heard of Gogol Bordello? It’s Gypsy Punk from Romania, where the singer’s family ended up after getting kicked out of Kiev after Tschernobyl. I love it, reminds me of Leningrad Cowboys, but gypsier. They played in Seattle the other day. If you ever get a chance, go see them.\r\n    La Literatura: Nadine Gordimer is a South African fiction writer. I’m deep into “Get a life”, the story of a couple, he ecologist, she advertisement, grappling with alienation after being forced apart by cancer treatment (he is radioactive after chemotherapy and a danger to his wife and child, after a life long battle against the building of nuclear reactors, ironic, ain’t it?).\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 6th, 2008 at 8:30 am\r\n\r\n    DOGGIES\r\n    Just a reminder. I know Cindy and Laura are gone this week, but I need to let Mr. Esspike, Mr. Zeus, Mr. Thor and Ms. Roxy know that they are not allowed to come play in the office for a while. From today, April 6th to Thursday April 10th there is a guest with a *very* animal-phobic daughter staying with us. Reservation #1036575. Thank You!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    has a manicure & pedicure person on call, who can give manicures & pedicures in guest rooms or at the spa after 6 PM. Please call spa to make appointments.\r\n    They will bring us their daily schedule every morning, have Morgan or I explain to you how to read it.\r\n\r\n    DIVE GROUP\r\n    may need a ride to the port tomorrow around 8:15 AM. Most of the group thinks it’s not necessary, unless it rains real hard.\r\n\r\n    ELDERHOSTEL\r\n    will arrive via remote check-in tomorrow. Please start making their invoices and keys after noon.\r\n\r\n    NEW SCHEDULE\r\n    is up\r\n\r\n    EVENT CALENDAR\r\n    is updated through June\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 4:16 pm\r\n\r\n    Ivan from Western Prince called and said they had an awesome trip today. They saw the residential J pod. And wanted to let everyone know that they will be going out tomorrow at 1200 again.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 5th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    I’m expecting a FedEx package from Lamps Plus on Wednesday, April 9th. When it comes, will you please call Dave Radden and let him know that it has arrived. Thank you!\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 8:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Bike number 7 has a flat and needs to be taken to the bike shop at some point tomorrow. What a night! The last official problem was searching for the headset in the bushes.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, thank you Laura.\r\n    Here on the front it got even better:\r\n    the dive group scheduled for arrival tomorrow, showed up today (not our mistake). We got them in. Morgan, the heroic, picked them up, interrupting his dinner, while Tory and I rearranged the hotel so we could fit them in.\r\n\r\n    Cindy called and wanted us all to utilize the Unit Maintenance feature on WRP as follows: when marking a room out of service, write in the “Description” section: room #, why room is out of service, you initials and date.\r\n\r\n    Also: Please select a couple of T-shirts from the gift shop and start wearing UNIFORM, chocolate brown pants, skirt or longish shorts and ELEMENTS merchandise on top.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Thank you so much for your help today. You are the BEST.\r\n    Rooming list for dive group on back desk.\r\n    Can you please ask Seth tomorrow if he fixed the toilet in 309?\r\n    Also: do you know if we can consolidate guest profiles in WRP like we used to in Rezo? We have about 450 different entries for Emerald Glass, for example.\r\n    See you at 12.30.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Once again, you guys ROCK!\r\n    Yes, once in a while mistakes get made.\r\n    Yes, once in a while we fall into a pool.\r\n    Yes, once in a while we get stressed out.\r\n    But in the end, you guys are all so amazing and I am proud and honored to be working with you.\r\n    Thank you all for caring.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 6:57 pm\r\n\r\n    Hoo Boy, almost sold out!\r\n\r\n    201 & 202\r\n    We checked guests into those rooms and they were not cleaned. Thanks God we had 2 open rooms available.\r\n\r\n    SPA DRAMA\r\n    We had a couple, who thought they have a massage tomorrow at 5 Pm, but the spa had them down for today at 5 PM. The reservation just said the time but not the day of the treatment. Always, always, always write:\r\n    1) what kind of treatment (how long, how many guests)\r\n    2) what time\r\n    3) what day\r\n    4) confirmed, fee added, voucher made\r\n    We rescheduled our guest’s other itinerary items and all was good in the end, but 2 therapists waited for over an hour for nothing. Please, don’t drop the ball!\r\n\r\n    BOOM TIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    The guest buying an online gift certificate gets charged automatically by boom time. We get an email.\r\n    1)Print it out\r\n    2) make gift certificate in WRP by changing guest status to “gift certificate only”\r\n    3) charge as gift certificate in payment screen (where cash/check/voucher payments are)\r\n    4) use same number as boom time gift certificate (if that number is already taken make it for example 5005-B for boom time, but keep the same number\r\n    5) put hard copy in basket with your initials and gift certificate number for another staff to double check.\r\n    Let me show you this one the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    SHOULDER SEASON BLUES\r\n    Gio & Tory, this one is for you. I could see it in your eyes over the last couple of days, thinking: “Holy s#@%!! What have I gotten myself into?”\r\n    When I was just a little puppy in the hotel industry last year and my entire body twitched every time the phone rang and I wrote down everything only to find later that I couldn’t read my own handwriting, the very wise Cindy, also known as the one who stays calm in brutal situations, said to me: “It’s going to get easier in the summer.” I thought:” How, how? How will 73 check-ins be easier than 52?” But it’s true. The month of May will be hard, very hard and then June will come and we will rock, plenty of staff, we will move our hips to Adam’s excellent music, it will be busy, a rush, fun. We will check the phone messages even before beautiful Laura can point out that the message light is blinking and forgotten will be how stressful it was to be all by yourself holding 5 balls in the air (I sure do like the balls, don’t I). Guys, we can do this, hang in there, the wise lady is right: it will get easier!\r\n    Much love.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 3:49 pm\r\n\r\n    DAY SPA\r\n    From now on the day spa will try to remember to fax us a copy of their schedule every night before they close. That means, on Friday night they will send us their availability schedule for Saturday. Then on Saturday night they will fax us their availability for Sunday. And so on and so forth. Hopefully this will help us to help guests with last minute bookings day of. Now remember this schedule is not law. Only a vague idea. At anytime after faxing us the schedule a given opening might be booked before you do. Just use it as a general guide.\r\n    OK? Thanks!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 11:11 am\r\n\r\n    ONITY\r\n    Within the next 2-3 days or so some Onity tech will call. He/She will want us to hook up the key making machine to the phone line. We have to use the line going into the fax machine because it doesn’t go through the regular phone system. Take the phone line out of the fax and plug it into the back of the key machine. Then follow the instructions from the Onity tech person. If you have any problems, or if your code doesn’t let you do what they want. Steffi, Cindy, or I have master codes. Call me if neither one of these people are around. Thanks all!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 10:19 am\r\n\r\n    The next food handler test is: April 17th at 9:00am, the location for the test is: District 3 Fire Station at 1011 Mullis St. All employee’s working at Bird Rock will need to take this test. We will cover the expense of the test. There is also a Spanish version during the same class. If you would like the Spanish version please let Cindy, Steffi or Morgan know and we can arrange this for you.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 4th, 2008 at 10:00 am\r\n\r\n    All water places in bldg D are marked out until next week. We are expecting a shipment from Pacific Coast Lighting. There will be 16 shades in the order, they are to all be installed right away in bldg D water places. Have Raquel do a double check on the rooms before opening them.\r\n    Garbage\r\n    Once again, please if you see garbage around the property pick it up… There are still those wonderful people who like to leave their trash hanging around.\r\n    I have the following Sun Places opened up: 332 (PET), 335,336,341,342.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2008 at 8:56 pm\r\n\r\n    SAN JUAN FITNESS\r\n    is telling inquiring guests that we still give out vouchers to their facilities. I couldn’t reach them tonight. Cindy, can you call them first thing in the morning and let them know that we don’t, please? 378-4449.\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY 4/4 TO SUNDAY 4/6\r\n    don’t clock in. Cindy is doing payroll early. Please write down your hours instead. Clock in again on Monday.\r\n\r\n    COCO MONTOYA BAND\r\n    Were on a late ferry, had no time to check in before performance, performance will go unitl 10.30 or so, no way to get their names and info before that. Here is the deal, I let them just ring the night manager and check in the rooms and get some rest. They will come into the offcie tomorrow morning and pay for their rooms. They may need more rooms than the allocation or less, we will adjust everything tomorrow. If we have trouble, like monetary loss, Sandy Cameron, the Performance Manager of the theater guaranteed to have the theater cover our losses.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK EARPLUGS\r\n    done and in my office (yeah Kaitlyn)\r\n\r\n    VISITOR’S BUREAU SURVEY\r\n    next to Onity machine. Give to guests to fill out and give back to us. SJVB will enter them into a drawing for a free stay in the islands.\r\n\r\n    LOVE & RESPECT\r\n    conference participants will get Earth places for $89, conference is in the end of April, no group folio made.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    April 3rd, 2008 at 4:56 pm\r\n\r\n    If any boxes come for Bird Rock, Elements, me or my mom, please, please, please email me with what is in the box and put it in my office. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n    Elena :) Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    There are goody bags in the back office for the FAM tour group that will be coming on Friday Please be sure to have them in the rooms for them when they arrive.\r\n\r\n    WHY?\r\n    does anyone know why room 108 is out of service there is nothing in the log, no clear maintenance slip, etc. Please have Seth check it out ASAP- Thanks\r\n\r\n    POOL PATIO GATE LOCK\r\n    Does anyone know where the key is? The gate is locked and I can’t find the key, I have tried a bunch, but no luck. We need to get that gate open so we can get the bikes out without having to navigate the tools, drop clothes, and lumber in the pool.\r\n\r\n    Please let housekeeping know that rm 110 needs a quick tidy, I had to move the guest last night\r\n\r\n    The Blog is giving me a hard time posting\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 9:54 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n    I figured out the below reservation dilemma. Please read the notes in file 1017323\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 2nd, 2008 at 9:15 am\r\n\r\n    Morgan\r\n    Did you already move 1017323? When I pulled up the reservation number it looked like it was all taken care of? You are correct, if the guest did have a reservation for earlier then June, and wanted to move it to June, we would need to have a deposit, and we for this time, it would be alright to apply the 10% deposit from his old reservation to his new one. Usually we don’t do this, and he would have to pay for another 10% deposit. If you have already moved the reservation as it looks to me to June, you need to make sure you write notes about what the previous reservation was and that he wanted to move it and ETC.. Thanks\r\n    Laura\r\n    Are you getting lost in the boxes and the furniture? Hang it there the light is at the end of the tunnel..\r\n    Uniform\r\n    Please remember to wear the uniform we require, that should have been in place by the 1st of April. Brown pants, skirts or longer shorts, and any of our ELEMENTS tops. We will soon have a new womens top, but until then let’s choose something from the gift shop.\r\n    Thanks everyone.. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    117 & 118\r\n    They are moving to the Harrison House on Weds. They have a daughter who works via internet and would need to stay in the room as long as possible. I have ok’d a noon checkout but they want closer to 2pm. I gave them the option of doing her work in the lobby but they would prefer to stay in the room longer. Please ask housekeeping how late they could stay. Currently there are no checkins for those rooms. So we shall see. They will call before 11am for the verdict or call them if they haven’t called by then. Thanks!!\r\n    TRASH DUMPSTERS\r\n    One of the building guy must have piled a bunch of demo’d stuff into the Recycling dumpster. The Recycling truck won’t take it and the Trash guys probably aren’t taking it because it is in a “Recycling” dumpster. Can we call the sanitation department to empty that thing? I don’t think it’s been emptied in over a week.\r\n    CINDY\r\n    #1017323 wants to cancel and get his deposit refunded. He’s not coming until June but I know we are trying to be stricter about the cancellation policy. He wants to talk to a manager about getting it refunded. Sorry. :(\r\n    REGINO\r\n    In 320 for the next 2 nights.\r\n\r\n    Later all!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    April 1st, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello everyone, thank you for the wonderful flowers and the kind card. You are all so thoughtful.\r\n    I wanted to let you know that the French Fam Tour will arrive about 2:30 on Friday. I have gift bags in my office that will need to be put in each room prior to arrival. Morgan could you please make sure this is done on Friday morning?\r\n    Commissions\r\n    Please remember to write down your guest add on so that I can pay you your 5% commission. Whoever does the leg work for the activity is the one who gets the commission, not the person who writes out the voucher. Let’s try and remember to write the voucher out ourselves if we can.\r\n    Parking\r\n    It’s time we are getting busy, let’s not forget to park back in building A..\r\n    Congrats Morgan, the first one to try out the new pool. JK\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 6:55 pm\r\n\r\n    ALVORD-RICHARDSON\r\n    Ok folks. To make our lives easier and to decrease the amount of frustration when making a reservation for them we have created the following protocol. When making a reservation for the Alvord-Richardson folks. Make it like you would normally do, making sure you select their corporate account from the drop-down box. Select their pricing option and put in the name of the worker arriving into the name slot. Then save. Take note of the reservation number. Then press the orange button at the top of the screen that looks like three little people standing next to each other. That will take you to the Group Folios section. Select the Alvord-Richardson group and then, once the page loads, select “Edit Folio” at the top of the page. Scroll down the new page that opens to the portion that lets you “…add an existing reservation to this folio…” Type the reservation number for the room(s) you just booked into one of the three empty slots and then press “Save.” That reservation will then be added to the master reservation list. Alvord’s CC# is saved in the group folio notes. You that to pay for the rooms. Please ask me if you have any questions about it.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 6:30 pm\r\n\r\n    Ha, you thought I was done posting for the day, didn’t you?\r\n\r\n    IF YOU FEEL USELESS\r\n    Go into the bathroom, look in the mirror and say: “I’m a good and worthy person”, or\r\n    Contact the other spas in FH and the island, get their pricing and hours, ask if we can send guests to them with vouchers if our spa is full, make sheets for our voucher folders.\r\n    Laminate new ferry schedules.\r\n    Go through upcoming check-ins through 4/9 and call guests who haven’t been informed about the pool closure and write in the guest remarks that guest has been informed.\r\n    Please write in log when one of those tasks is finished or tackled.\r\n    Thank you and thank you so much for all your work on the voucher folders, they look fabulicious.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK VOUCHERS\r\n    Elena created an accordion folder for finished Bird Rock vouchers. If you schedule add-ons for Bird Rock, start making vouchers so we don’t get slammed when we open. Voucher folder & accordion folder are in white box in my office, across from the safe.\r\n\r\n    MONEY MONEY MONEY\r\n    Please only use folio 2 in WRP if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n    Double check payments on reconciliation report. If there is an outstanding balance, research why. The only reason we should have an outstanding balance is for direct bills. Put in Cindy’s or my box if you can’t figure it out.\r\n\r\n    If a guest needs a refund, we will need to swipe or obtain the credit card number the refund goes to every time. Our system doesn’t keep card numbers. The next time there is a refund, get Cindy. And as always for refunds other than our errors, you’ll need a managers permission.\r\n\r\n    AND LAST\r\n    Always get a guest’s phone number, email address and credit card info to put on file. See #1070681. Kaitlyn, any idea how we could get a hold of them?\r\n\r\n    See you all Thursday at noon for the Bird Rock Meeting!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 31st, 2008 at 2:09 pm\r\n\r\n    PARKING\r\n    As of today, please park your vehicles up by building A. You too Morgan, oh competent one, holder of the ship when boss ladies are absent. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    CLEAVAGE\r\n    Gorgeous girl workers, until we have the summer uniforms figured out, please dress unrevealing around the chest area. What I mean to say is: put a bra on them and T-shirt over it. Gracias!\r\n\r\n    SCHEDULE\r\n    Next week’s schedule is up. We have a 9-5 shift now and everything is new and different once more, so please look. Danke!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 30th, 2008 at 7:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey,\r\n    Great staff meeting today, thank you guys. I especially liked Gio’s hairdo!!! (how was the wedding?).\r\n\r\n    Laura: Raquel will put her thinking cap on, regarding the easel. She hasn’t seen it since the event.\r\n\r\n    Raquel has a pet peeve: please don’t put garbage, like old flowers, next to the garbage can, put it in the garbage can.\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn: regarding below questions: refunds must be o.k.ed by a manager.\r\n    Those travel agent reservations coming through WRP, creating an alarm are UNIREZ reservations. They are just like the old inntopias only easier. All you do is:\r\n    1) take 10%\r\n    2) print out copy, initial and put in basket for somebody else to double check\r\n    3) turn alarm off, file email under UNIREZ, done!\r\n    We’ll work together Thursday (yeah!), make sure to ask every question you always wanted to ask.\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for the wishes and gifties, you guys are the sweetest.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 10:43 pm\r\n\r\n    309\r\n    The Toilet is leaking at the base. The guest in there is a plumber and says we just need to replace the wax seal.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 9:16 pm\r\n\r\n    211\r\n    The heater in 211 doesn’t seem to be working either. Both 209 and 211 heater dials turn freely but the heater never turns on.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 29th, 2008 at 7:47 am\r\n\r\n    Please don’t forget when you are editing or confirming booking options in reservations to TURN OFF ANY ALARMS set for that reservation. (if relevant)\r\n\r\n    Thanks\r\n    kj\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 28th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS\r\n    Reservation #1064850 is a no show at closing. Please charge them in the morning if they don’t check in after hours. Thank you.\r\n    209\r\n    The heater in 209 suddenly stopped working. No breaker was tripped and the thermostat doesn’t do anything. I have blocked it out for the time being. Please tell Seth if he comes in.\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    Just a reminder the Hideaway has a check-in on Sat. Their keys are on the back desk.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2008 at 9:22 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there…turns out I am very forgetful about turning the outside lights on in the evening. I was hoping we could set up an alarm in Outlook to remind us to do that every night.\r\n\r\n    I have had some questions about refunds. Are we aloud to do that or is it just the managers? Also…we are getting some reservations from travel agents over the internet that set up auto alarms. I am not quite sure how to deal with these reservations because we do not have any contact info for the guest. Also…how are we recording/processing these reservations? Does the alarm need to stay on there? I sure do miss Steffi. She had the answers to all these questions.\r\n\r\n    Have a great day and see you on Saturday!\r\n    kj\r\n    from Laura Says:\r\n    March 27th, 2008 at 4:40 pm\r\n\r\n    From Laura written by Kaitlyn\r\n    Downtown Dog has given us a flier for their services. If we run out of pet rooms or if people need to have pet sitting recommended while they are staying with us…they can be referred. They usually do not board dogs but can board up to 4 dogs at one time. They are left in a colony setting (no kennels) which is why they are restricted in the number of dogs they can keep over night. They also have pet grooming services if guests are interested in bathing their pets or want grooming done while owners are out and about. Laura has had a great experience with them from taking Roxy there and would highly recommend them. The base prices are on the flier they gave us. It will be posted in the front desk manual in the rates and info section. Take a look.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 26th, 2008 at 9:43 pm\r\n\r\n    ok. does it all happen when i am working? i checked some nice folks into room 203 and it was dirty. wow wow we wow. looks like it wasn’t booked for quite some time. don’t know how it slipped through the cracks.\r\n\r\n    the lights outside were all unplugged. how did that happen. i had to futz with them in the dark not know what was happening. push this button plug what in????oh, my goodness. i finally got it.\r\n\r\n    Morgan answered my laundry room question and Elena popped in and answered my room alarm question. Thank YOU!!\r\n\r\n    There are a couple of reservation questions printed out and left on the back desk. Then there is an odd e-mail i don’t know what to do with. I left it in the inbox for someone with more knowledge of pulling up past records for this fellow who wants to redeem an old gift certificate.\r\n\r\n    And….the end.\r\n    kj\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 26th, 2008 at 8:58 am\r\n\r\n    TEST TEST\r\n    We recieved about 5 phony reservations for Bird Rock all of them with fake credit card numbers and under the name test test. Under requests; they all say This is only a test please ignore it. Are these done by anyone here? Maybe Adam testing the system? If not then we need to be checking the online reservations for Bird Rock often so that these types of reservations don’t prevent other people from booking\r\n\r\n    1073491\r\n    Said he talked to someone about a week ago about getting the Wind Place for $350.00 He was told that a manager would get back to him but no one ever did, I told him that someone would get back to him on Thursday (when Steffie gets back) he will have 4 adults and 2 kids and he wants it for May 9th.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 10:01 pm\r\n\r\n    Rez 1063784:\r\n    Still no word from this lady so I am assuming we will just go ahead and cancel it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    WHALE WATCHING FOR 108:\r\n    The couple in 108 was interested in whale watching tomorrow, i was able to get a hold of Maya’s and he has space for 2 at 3:00pm, they also asked how likely they were to see them so you can tell them Jim said they had seen them 2 out of the last 4 days, $69per person rate.\r\n\r\n    NO SHOWS?\r\n    As of 9:57PM Rez #1033035 & Rez # 1061083 had not shown up, Morgan Knows.\r\n\r\n    Rez 970369:\r\n    He has apparently moved his reservation several times and came in today to cancel 2 out of his 3 nights so he now has only Tuesday night booked, under his reservation notes it said to charge him if he canceled again, I checked with Cindy and she said YES! charge him since we have already spent so much time going back and forth with him.\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 3:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Well, today was quite the interesting day for me. I still need to work on Bird Rock’s shpeel. I had an interesting time with one :( Oh well my spine will stiffin’ up sooner than later. Oh yah…I took care of all the updates on the whale watch tour prices, dates and the kayak prices and dates. So our voucher binder is stuffed full of only the newest stuff. Yay me!! AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEFFI!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 12:36 pm\r\n\r\n    Adam and I have been donating some gift certificates\r\n    recently on which we have written “No Holidays” or “Excluding Holidays”. Posted in Steffi’s office is a quick and easy reference with these days listed.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 24th, 2008 at 9:34 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Gang,\r\n\r\n    Two little deals today:\r\n\r\n    First, please (if you’re not already doing this) make a habit of checking the staff2staff blog postings at the start of each shift and make sure you read backwards to the last time you checked the blog. I think that some of us may be in the habit of just looking at the last post or two and thus missing some important messages that may have been posted a few days ago. Since we are really using this communication tool for critical messages, we all need to be sure we are reading every post, not just the ones from yesterday. Make sense?\r\n\r\n    Second, I have heard some rumblings of the front desk music supply maybe getting a little too familiar. I will be adding another playlist or two over the next couple of weeks, including a new one from Bird Rock Hotel that I think most of you will really like. HOWEVER: there is currently almost 10 straight days worth of tunes set up at the front desk, and if you’re hearing a lot of repeats then you are not playing the playlist I intend to be played 90% of the time, which is the “Hotel Blender” playlist. I know there are sounds on there that don’t necessarily agree with your particular tastes, but please remember that the music we play is part of our hotel identity. While I hope you enjoy a significant portion of the music we play, and that it helps make your work day more enjoyable, it is not something meant to entertain us. I understand and sympathize with anyone who may get tired of the style we have chosen, but that’s why you have your own ipods and music to listen to when you’re not at work. The music we play is for our guests, not for us. Please go back to putting on the blender playlist most of the time and just let it rip. Curse me if you must, and sorry for being such a stick in the mud; but thanks for indulging the marketing department our little quirks….\r\n\r\n    See ya….\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 9:48 pm\r\n\r\n    320 blind broke, seth came in around 8 30 to take care of that. thank you.\r\n\r\n    im heading out on the 2nd, and will be getting my wisdom teeth out the day after i get back. get ready chubby chipmonk~~~ you will all hear from me then!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 6:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Birthday to Steffi, Happy Birthday to Steffi, Happy Birthday Dear Steffi…Happy Birthday to YOU!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 23rd, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Door is fixed. Seth will send off the bad lock on Monday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 22nd, 2008 at 8:30 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Door is acting up again. I have a call in to Seth. If you don’t hear from him, please move guest to another room and block out 320.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 22nd, 2008 at 6:36 pm\r\n\r\n    KHAILI\r\n    won’t be at work tomorrow. She is tending to her great grand mother off island.\r\n\r\n    HIDEAWAY\r\n    We have a check-in for the Hideaway on 3/29. Left msg with guest to check-in at ELEMENTS, left msg with Dave & housekeeper, so they know. Keys on my desk, charge in Bird Rock WRP.\r\n\r\n    I’m off next week. I will be back on Sunday, 3/30, when I have come to terms with my age.\r\n    Love you all!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2008 at 5:17 pm\r\n\r\n    VOUCHER FOLDERS\r\n    We’ll have the luxury of being overstaffed for the next couple of weeks. Here are some things I would like to see get done:\r\n    Morgan & Gio: overhaul ELEMENTS voucher folder, make updated vouchers and voucher tracking sheets, create vouchers for San Juan Outfitters, delete vouchers we no longer use (Lavendera, restaurant vouchers, etc.)\r\n    Also: whoever goes to the po on Monday, stop by the office supply place and get a large folder, so we can start a voucher folder for Bird Rock.\r\n    Elena & Kaitlyn: Please create a voucher folder, vouchers & tracking sheets for Bird Rock, exactly like the one we have at ELEMENTS. Create the vouchers on my computer (Bird Rock logo is on desk top). Don’t forget gift certificates (for rooms, massages & restaurants, the nice ones on the skinny paper).\r\n\r\n    Other jobs in case you are slow and get bored: update phone list, print new ELEMENTS rate sheets (saying: higher prices in shoulder season FRIDAY & Saturday, create Beach Cruiser Release form for Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    Also: I want everybody to go through their personal folders on “my” computer and the Bird Rock computer and throw files away you/we no longer need.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please don’t forget to tell Cindy about the refund issue we are having. Please contact the guest and tell him it will take until Monday to resolve the issue.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 21st, 2008 at 12:50 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi gang,\r\n\r\n    We have a group of French Group Tour operators staying with us on Friday, April 4th. We need to get little gift bags together for all of them (which Cindy and I will try to work on next week). Also, I just wanted to give you a head’s up that they will also be having a little continental breakfast in our lobby on Saturday morning. I’ve been trying to find them a better alternative, to no avail. I okay’d it with Morgan. Morgan, you might want to make sure that there is plenty of coffee available for them. I believe they want to come in around 8 (I’ll let them know not to come any earlier).\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    SPRINGBOARD AT BIRD ROCK\r\n    On the Bird Rock Specials site it reads:\r\n    springboard ~ be the first to experience a san juan island lodging revolution\r\n    bird rock hotel will open for business starting late april. we are so excited to share this experience with you. request “springboard” with your reservation and we will treat you to complimentary champagne during any visit during the months of april or may. celebrate!\r\n    So if guests request that, please write : “free split of champagne upon arrival” in the guest remarks, also create an alarm for the day of arrival.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 20th, 2008 at 5:54 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    We rescheduled the Bird Rock meeting to Thursday, 4/3/08 noon, here at ELEMENTS. Please be there (I have a feeling you might, since every person working at Bird Rock is on the schedule that day, yippiee)\r\n\r\n    I LOVE INNS\r\n    Kaitlyn, RE:1063913 Bird Rock: The emails we get from Iloveinns.com are inquiries only. It is our job to contact the guest directly, not make a reservation immediately. I don’t know what the original inquiry said (no phone or email, it’s not in the email in-box?) or what you wrote to Adam (forward me next time?). I canceled the reservation since there was no way to contact the guest. And we currently are not participating in any promotion with Iloveinns. So when we get one of those, or from anybody else for that matter (I got an inquiry for the Friday Harbor Inn from Purple Roofs this afternoon), you call or email the guest. It’s just like a phone message.\r\n    I’m sorry, famous K, it must be hard to read kilometers of log entries twice a week and remember every tiny bit. But please, all of you, if you aren’t clear on something, write it in the log, so we all know and one of us can follow up.\r\n    I’m thinking about how to streamline all the exceptions, groups, little things you’ll need to know. Let’s bring this up at the meeting.\r\n\r\n    320 & 107\r\n    Doors are fixed, yeah Seth!\r\n\r\n    Busy, busy, busy\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2008 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    320\r\n    Can someone please ask Seth to take a look at the lock on 320’s door. It is giving the error that says the privacy lock is on when it is not (flashing red/green). He probably just needs to disconnect that deadbolt sensor thing until a new lock can be put on. I have made a temporary fix but it’s not a great solution. I made a maintenance request but please remind him because there is a guy in there until Friday.\r\n    Regino\r\n    His Regino-ness is in 321 for the next 2 nights.\r\n    Thank You All.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 18th, 2008 at 1:48 pm\r\n\r\n    hi there. busy with the phones today. i had some folks returning messages from other front desk staff and upon looking in their reservation…the notes were very mysterious. Just that the guest was called. so…could we be a little more specific about why we are asking guests to call us back? thanks! (i sounded kinda silly with this fellow…hmmm, well thanks for calling back but it doesn’t say why we wanted you too…)\r\n\r\n    also…is there a way we can get all our misc. deals and specials for special groups and reservations in one place. some of them are only e-mailed to us from adam, some are posted on the web…some are posted in the blog… for us part timers…we don’t get to book them all the time so it is very confusing to try to find the specifics. we know there is such a special but i end up doing whatever the guest says it is because i can’t find the reference. i will try to get some together before i leave today.\r\n\r\n    other than that…you are all rock stars for doing this 5 days a week. rock on baby!\r\n\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 9:32 am\r\n\r\n    ISLAND BICYCLES\r\n    As of today we have an account at IB. If one of our beach cruiser bikes breaks (Bird Rock & ELEMENTS), just bring it over there, pick it back up once it’s fixed. Paul will bill us monthly.\r\n    Starting in May they’ll be open 7 days a week from 9-6.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 8:24 am\r\n\r\n    Adam, just to let you know, our talented Elena is off this week (semana santa). She will be back 3/24.\r\n\r\n    Wednesday\r\n    I will have a meeting with Cloud, Maureen & Daniel about the food coop on Wednesday at 1, either here in the lobby or in a sea place if one is open. Among other things we’ll talk about sharing distributors for Bird Rock breakfast orders. Just so you know what on earth I’m doing here on a Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    Also on Wednesday: a special appearance by our fabulous and unforgotten LILLY!\r\n\r\n    Happy getting the snakes off the island day!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 17th, 2008 at 6:40 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Elena: Did the program you used for those cool floor plans produce a square footage number? Do you think it could? If it did, can you forward me that info for each Bird Rock room? Also, do they have you doing that for ELEMENTS? When/if they do, can you forward me square footage info for those as well? Thanks Elena!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 16th, 2008 at 9:44 pm\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Raquel asks to print the following 2 reports for her in the mornings:\r\n    1) a housekeeping report\r\n    2) the WRP page showing today’s check-ins w/ stays & today’s check-outs\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 6:55 pm\r\n\r\n    Also to let everyone know. Per Cindy: there is a special room rate for anyone in the Madden family this weekend of $50.00 a night for however many days they need the room for.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 6:47 pm\r\n\r\n    DIVERS\r\n    I o.ked a noon check out for them, they will be diving in the morning and won’t be back until then. So they will need a ride down to the clock dock right around then.\r\n    Haven’t heard back from the group leader about last night. Will keep you posted.\r\n\r\n    SPECIALS\r\n    We (and when I say “we” I mean Adam) changed the price for the Equinox package (one night in Sky, 1 hour couple’s massage, $75 dining credit) to $387 (book Sky place, then add “equinox package” in “guest charges”.\r\n\r\n    Also: Sea & Wind places are excluded from the “supersize your weekend” promotion, just to let you all know.\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 5:45 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Morgan!\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the tour of Bird Rock. I now have an idea of what is to come this summer! The printer in the office is making a funny clicking sound. You seem to be the printer magician so please check it out. Hopefully you have a quieter evening than last nights! Thanks T.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 15th, 2008 at 3:13 pm\r\n\r\n    PROBLEMS (otherwise known as the plight of poor 101)\r\n    At approx. 11:30pm Friday night the lady in 101 called me to complain about noise coming from the rooms beside her. She was very pleasant but obviously distressed. Turns out some of the dive-trip folks were having a bit of a domestic dispute. A verbal fight was raging between one of the girls in 102 and one of the guys in 104. Doors were slamming, voices were raising, and I wasn’t going to let it continue. When I arrived outside Building A, the lovely couple was in 104. I could hear them from the parking lot. I called their room and told them to quiet down and asked the lady if the cops needed to be called. She seem sufficiently embarrassed enough to call off the scream-fest. I hung around outside for about 20 more minutes as they has a quiet chat outside before going back to their respective rooms.\r\n    *Cut to Saturday morning*\r\n    101 calls the front desk to inform us that water is currently streaming down from the ceiling above their vanity. She says she can hear children screeching and they have been up since 6am. The folks in 201 were having their kids take a bath. Who knows if there was excess splashing going on but 101 is now blocked out for the rest of the week. 101 had informed me last night of their possible desire to leave early and the little water show cemented it. 101 has been a supremely good sport and I refunded their stay and sent them up to the West Bestern. She was very nice and she says she will be back during whale season.\r\n    101 is now blocked out for a week and 201 is blocked out starting tomorrow when the folks in there check-out.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 9:34 pm\r\n\r\n    310\r\n    The blinds don’t close. I moved guests to different room and blocked room out until Monday. Morgan, can you please make sure HK cleans the room and maybe ask Regino to have a look at it? (I filled out a maintenance request)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 7:53 pm\r\n\r\n    THE BALL, DON’T DROP IT\r\n    Guys, please make sure to print out each online reservation and follow up on all special requests. If a reservation is for the summer, make sure to create an alarm for at least a week in advance to make sure we have enough time to order flowers, book massages, rent cars, have chocolate & champagne at hand, etc., etc., you get where I’m going, yes?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    It’s not news to us, but it’s still news to everybody making a reservation with us (our website says our pool will reopen mid March): please please please let guests know that our pool house is out of order and write in the guests remarks section of their reservation that they know, that you emailed, phoned, wrote a postcard, send a message in a bottle. We had several very disappointed kids today.\r\n    We are shooting towards opening it again 4/1, but please tell early April arrivals that it may still be under construction.\r\n\r\n    DIVING GROUP\r\n    Will check out Sunday. They will need a ride down to the clock dock (mostly for their luggage). I’m not sure at what time yet.\r\n\r\n    Check out the new schedule. Everything is different! Make sure you make yourself available for the staff meetings:\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock (all Bird Rock staff, including HK) on Thursday, 3/27 at noon here at ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS front desk on Sunday, 3/30 at 2 PM\r\n\r\n    Thank you all for your hard work. I’m so proud of Gio and Tory, who did their first phone reservations and did great. Thanks Elena for putting your organizational hat on and making the front desk look immaculate. Thank you Kaitlyn for taking on the most complicated reservation request of this century and plowing away at it, you are the best follower upper on the team. And Morgan, well, you are my Rock, nuff said.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 14th, 2008 at 8:14 am\r\n\r\n    Hi All: big thanks to Elena for making me such lovely gift certificate to take on my marketing trip to Seattle and Portland next week! Nice work Elena!\r\n\r\n    Also, there are new referral codes in WRP. “Family & Friends” is pretty self-explanatory: to be used when making a booking for family and friends of any staff member.\r\n\r\n    There is a series of codes called “Health Club Promo: ‘name of club’” because we will soon launch a new marketing campaign in cooperation with health and fitness clubs in Seattle, Portland, Anacortes and Bellingham. I really need these tracked well, so please take care to select the proper code.\r\n\r\n    Then there is “Management Comps” which can only be used with permission from Laura, Adam, Steffi or Cindy, and will be used when we give away a room for promotional, trade or donation purposes. If you are ever called upon to make a reservation using this code, please always include who asked you to comp the room in the comments section.\r\n\r\n    I know the phones are starting to ramp up and spring is in the air. Please let me know if there are any marketing tools that you think might help you turn as many of those calls as possible into bookings. This time of year it’s all about converting interest in bookings, so if you routinely find that something keeps people from going ahead with a reservation, please, please, please make sure I know about it. Use our discount programs creatively and help callers get exactly what they need to make the reservation work.\r\n\r\n    thanks everyone! We are so lucky to have such a great, dedicated and wonderful staff. I’m really excited about going into this busy season with such a strong team! Have fun…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 6:32 pm\r\n\r\n    312\r\n    the new shades aren’t closing. The current guests are stay-overs. I called Seth, he will look at it tomorrow. Cindy, can you please remind him.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 5:53 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Happy beginning of the work week!\r\n    Please start making keys for the diving group arriving at 4 (invoices not necessary).\r\n    Also: Gio will be training with you Saturday 7.30 to 3.30. I’ll leave her training check-list on my back desk.\r\n\r\n    SAMANTHA FROM GIRL FRIDAY\r\n    Will help us answer our phones again this Spring. She will email us messages. Make those messages a priority please, call guests back right away, etc. Then file her messages in our inbox under “girl friday messages”)\r\n\r\n    BUILDING D\r\n    Will probably open 4/1 with new floors, new paint, new linens, but with the somewhat seasoned furniture.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    We are shooting towards opening Friday 4/18 with an open house on Sunday, 4/27.\r\n\r\n    FIESTA UH LALA FELIX MARGARITA OLE\r\n    That’s right. We will have our Cinco de Mayo, 1 year ELEMENTS anniversary party coming up on Saturday, 5/10.\r\n    This will also be the day where we will all start to wear our uniforms again, always and with no exception: chocolate brown pants and orange shirts (Cindy promised to get us some girl shirts!).\r\n\r\n    Laura brought fancy chocolates for us, check them out. Mhm. I will give the Almonds, Hazelnuts and Pistachios in milk chocolate a good home in my belly.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 13th, 2008 at 8:06 am\r\n\r\n    Puget Sound blood Center:\r\n    There is a note that says they were faxed a CC authorization, did we ever get it back? I didn’t charge anything yet in case. but will charge later this morning after I check with One of the boss ladies and they say its ok.\r\n\r\n    I had one last minute walk-in last night, they read the ferry schedule wrong, two very nice ladies and a baby.\r\n    kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2008 at 2:04 pm\r\n\r\n    wow, so it was a busy day here. need i say more? hmmm but important things to relay…nothing emergent. so have a nice afternoon.\r\n    kj\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 12th, 2008 at 9:06 am\r\n\r\n    Mopeds and Bikes\r\n    I just spoke with Susie Moped, she is available now for rentals, even if she is not open, she will come down and do a rental. Also, she will be renting out the bikes for Paul at Island Bicycles, if he is closed, she will have bikes at both her Roche Harbor spot and her Friday Harbor spot. First call Island Bicycles and then Susie Moped.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 9:53 pm\r\n\r\n    RANDOM FYI\r\n    - Regino is in 320 for the next 2 nights. I blocked it out.\r\n    - There is a folder on the back desk for Deborah Hopkins. She should come pick it up in the next couple of days.\r\n    - The identifier for the Orca Storage room is ALLSTAFF on the key system. (odd huh?)\r\n    - There is a red and white truck, with a dog in the cab, parked on the access road to the guest house. If it is still there in the morning we may have to make sure it’s moved. We don’t want the co-owner of that road to get displeased. :)\r\n    - Spring must really be here because I got harassed by a bee this afternoon. First one I’ve seen this year.\r\n    - Laters! -\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 7:38 pm\r\n\r\n    Congrats Gio on your first post. Well done. Let’s hope we can get that brown water problem solved…soon!\r\n\r\n    Kaitlyn, in answer to your question about the road construction question, and to all of those of you who have no idea what she’s talking about: The Town of Friday Harbor will be replacing a significant part of their sewer system over the next 18 months. They plan on starting up by the sewage treatment plant (on Tucker). They don’t plan on coming into the core of town until next winter, at which point there will be construction on First street in front of Bird Rock. We shouldn’t have anything to be concerned about until then (keep your fingers crossed). When they do start construction, it should be manageable (I’ve talked with them at length about this.)\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 11th, 2008 at 1:57 pm\r\n\r\n    hi there. phones were kinda slow. but people in and out and some e-mail reservations. i am getting my big bird rock guest taken care of…slowly. details details. lots of inquiries for our “new” property opening up…i just want to know when the road construction will start. i just found out about our commission sheet. hooray for the poor folks out there. how creepy for and brave of elena to confront the intruders. more guts than me. i would have called the po po.\r\n\r\n    take care of yourselves out there in the sun. block it.\r\n    by the way…the play is going swimmingly. and becoming more and more fun to be a part of.\r\n\r\n    KJ\r\n    Gio Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 2:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello-\r\n    My first blog!!!! So about our rooms ( Building B )Were looked at today by Rob the plumber, and Jack from west mechanical. Our thermostat was set way toooo HOT 195 F. West M. turned that down, and that may have been the reasoning behind the rusty water?? So Regino is going to flush the hot water tanks today, and hopefully we will be on to new clear water. Yeah :)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 11:07 am\r\n\r\n    LAURA SAYS\r\n    If people call for the WA State Scenic Byways conference on April 30, please give them the rate of $89 and a Sky or Earth place.\r\n\r\n    CINDY SAYS\r\n    When processing a reservation, you need to make sure the credit card is valid. Process it while you have the guest on the phone. Don’t ever send a confirmation without processing the credit card first. And please take down the phone number of the guest, so you can at least try to reach them if something goes wrong.\r\n    I will cancel the 2 reservation for Bird Rock with above problems today.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 10:27 am\r\n\r\n    ADAM SAYS:\r\n    Shoulder season room rates are higher Friday & Saturday night, not only Saturday night.\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock will have split rates from May 1-22, with Fri/Sa being higher than weekdays, and summer rates every day starting May 23.\r\n\r\n    Just so we all know.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    March 10th, 2008 at 10:13 am\r\n\r\n    Building B\r\n    I have called and left a message for Rob to come and check the brown water issue. I have also reminded him to fix the pump in the laundry room that is leaking.\r\n    AAA\r\n    Our official agreement with AAA has expired (our choice), so we will no longer be advertising, or posting anything to do with AAA. Laura says we can still offer a AAA rate though.\r\n    Elena\r\n    Wow you are a BRAVE women. Was your curling iron HOT??\r\n    Where was Edgar?\r\n    New carpet is being installed in the upstairs of building D, I am hoping to have that building open by April 1, 2008. I will keep you all updated.\r\n    Bird Rock\r\n    We will be getting new brochures for Bird Rock, we are just not sure by when. Hopefully we will have updated pictures on the website by the end of April.\r\n    Pool\r\n    Insulation should be put in today, sheeting rocking should be right behind that. Just an FYI, we do have a lock on the door above the ladies bathroom, that is the room with some computer equipment in it. The key is in the office.\r\n    Thats it for now..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Quiet tonight. Morgan set all the guest room clocks ahead.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 10:44 am\r\n\r\n    BUILDING B *Update*\r\n    I asked Regino to run the water in the other rooms to see what is going on. He seems to think that it may only happen when you are running the hot water. Maybe we need to flush out the Hot Water tank or the storage tank? I am not a plumbing expert so… I’m not sure.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    March 9th, 2008 at 10:32 am\r\n\r\n    BUILDING B\r\n    We have been getting some reports from guests over the past couple weeks that they are having intermittent to full-on “rusty-colored water” coming out of their faucets and spigots. Sometimes it only does it for a minute or two and then sometimes it won’t go away. We move folks to a new room and come back the next day and it’s running clear. It’s really strange. Is the town flushing their system again or do we need to call Rob?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 8th, 2008 at 8:53 pm\r\n\r\n    RATES & RATES\r\n    Please read Adam’s email about rate changes. Morgan updated the rate sheets already.\r\n\r\n    Also: when making a booking in WRP and you don’t see as an option BEST RATE AVAILABLE or AAA/AARP or a current special, just others (like ELDERHOSTEL), then we are sold out. All rooms still available are already allocated. Let me show you an example the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    FIRST FLIGHT\r\n    Is a promotion for making reservations at Bird Rock between now and 3/31/08. If a guests refers to or requests the FIRST FLIGHT special, write in their reservation that we will put a complimentary split of champagne in their room when they arrive. Also create an alarm for their arrival date, reminding us to put the champagne in their room.\r\n\r\n    NIGHT MANAGER OF THE MONTH\r\n    Goes to Elena! A construction worker from Bird Rock came up to ELEMENTS last night, telling Gio and I that he will be the last one out and doesn’t have a key. When we had all our check-ins in, we went down there, with our rate sheet and I showed Gio around. When we were in the Lopez we heard foot steps. Then Elena appeared in the door, complete with iron rod in her hand, ready to bash in the intruders heads. We all burst out laughing. Ladies & gentlemen, there is a woman doing her job!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    March 7th, 2008 at 9:14 pm\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder–bet it’s going around–set the clocks forward Saturday night before closing. In fact, maybe we should put it on the housekeeping sheet to set clocks forward as they clean Saturday???\r\n\r\n    Have a great weekend……..\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 6th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Morning Morgan,\r\n    would you be a Sweetheart and answer Bird Rock’s email inquiries this morning, please?\r\n    We also need to print more gift certificates. Can you print some if Cindy isn’t too busy?\r\n    See you at 3.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 6th, 2008 at 9:04 pm\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Please know that room 107 still doesn’t have a functioning lock. Gio and I blocked it out until 3/14. Please remind Seth to check that out.\r\n\r\n    NEW BOOKINGS\r\n    Guys, check that new bookings section. There were online reservation from several days in there, what up?\r\n\r\n    ADD ONS\r\n    When a guest selects add-ons when making an online reservation (whale watch, etc.), WRP calculates the price according for how many guests a room was rented for, just to give the guest an idea of the cost. Then, when we process the reservation the charges revert to zero. ERGO: when you book a massage, whale watch or kayak tour, you need to add the applicable charges to the room manually.\r\n\r\n    Laura, you have done what I was not able to in 14 years: you found a chocolate Daniel likes: the hickory smoked almonds with sea salt and milk chocolate you brought us from Las Vegas. Wow. Thank you!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2008 at 7:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Morgan,\r\n    I didn’t flush while you were in the shower today…I was so proud of myself that I remembered!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 5th, 2008 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi friends,\r\n    I just to remind you all that when you take a reservation for a PET room, please try to get the PET NAME so that we can put it in our cute little welcome PET letter.\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    March 4th, 2008 at 2:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi there. Pretty slow on the phones today. I did take some more early arrivals for the kayaking Elderhostel coming up this spring. We have started a folder on the back desk for early arrivals so that we can keep them in the same room. So when the group gets created on the system…just double check to make sure the guest can stay in the same room for their whole stay. Some of those rooms have been locked. When making a new early arrival…print out the face sheet and put it in the folder.\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    I did an update on the Big Bird Rock package we have going on. Waiting on Brian G. from Outfitters to get back to me about the kayak tour. I placed it in your box again.\r\n\r\n    All else good. See you tomorrow.\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi from ELEMENTS Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 9:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Tea is ordered. We need small dog bones for our guest dogs. If somebody goes shopping, buy some bulk for us, would you?\r\n\r\n    I talked to Capt. Maya today, he’ll raise his prices this summer to $75 per person. Make sure you let guests know that and adjust the price accordingly in WRP when booking with Maya.\r\n\r\n    San Juan Safari dropped off price & activity sheet for this summer. They’ll start April 5 and will only offer whale watch cruises out of FH and chartered boat trips.\r\n\r\n    San Juan Outfitters (who bought the kayaking operation from SJS) will offer kayaking from FH and RH and whale watch cruises from RH.\r\n\r\n    TGIM (thanks God it’s Monday). I’ll see you all in a couple of days.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 5:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, Elena, what research. I can’t wait for March 16th. I mean who doesn’t love hiccups?\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 2:39 pm\r\n\r\n    We need to order an assortment Tazo teas for the lobby.\r\n\r\n    The floor plan is done for the wind place.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 2:37 pm\r\n\r\n    301 & 302 both had very brown water today so the folks that were set to check-in for the building have been moved to 107& 108.\r\n\r\n    The porthole group that will be coming in March 14-16th will need a pick-up at the ferry around 3-4pm they will call up but I set an alarm for that day anyways, just as a reminder.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    March 3rd, 2008 at 9:38 am\r\n\r\n    Good Morning all! Yes! It is March only 17 days to spring, tulips are peaking through the ground, bunny day is just around the corner (did you hide your eggs yet?, and of course St Patrick’s day. But don’t forget to celebrate these other little known, skipped over, forgotten days of March.\r\n\r\n    March 6: Dentist Day & Frozen Food Day.\r\n    March 8: Daylight savings begins! International Women’s day.\r\n    March 9: Cabin fever day (get you some cabin fever!)\r\n    March 10: National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\r\n    March 11: Organize your home office day!\r\n    March 12: Girl Scout’s Birthday! Load up on girl scout cookies\r\n    March 14: Potato chip day & Save a spider day\r\n    March 16: hiccup day\r\n    March 19: Chocolate caramel day (just for you steffi)\r\n    March 20: Barbie Doll Day, First day of Spring\r\n    March 22: Goof off day!\r\n    March 23: Easter Sunday\r\n    March 24: Chocolate covered raisins day\r\n    March 27: fly a kite day (Hope there is enough wind, kites are no fun on the ground)\r\n    March 28: Something on a stick Day (hhhhmmmmm)\r\n    March 30: Doctor’s Day!\r\n\r\n    So Celebrate march\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2008 at 8:50 pm\r\n\r\n    I’m so glad we have Tory and Khaili on board, you guys ROCK! Khaili processed online reservations tonight like she never did anything else in her entire life.\r\n\r\n    Please, everybody, check Bird Rock’s WRP daily, we are getting lot’s and lot’s of reservations (don’t forget to print them out for somebody else to double check).\r\n\r\n    Western Prince called today to let us know that they will start their wild life cruises on 3/29 this year ($69 for adults, $49 for kids). They will go out any day they get 8 customers together (at noon), just to let you all know.\r\n\r\n    Morgan, Capt. Maya called back, but I couldn’t find the reservation in question. He will call you Tuesday night.\r\n\r\n    Thank you Elena, for covering a shift tomorrow morning on such short notice, you are a gem.\r\n\r\n    STEPS menus are in the rooms, except 311 & 322.\r\n    Khaili Says:\r\n    March 2nd, 2008 at 7:32 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n    I have now completed my second shift with Steffi. I think I am getting the hang of things, now. Well, hope you all have a great week :) See you next Sunday\r\n    Tory Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2008 at 11:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey!\r\n    My first all nighter with Steffi!! I really feel like part of the family now. Steffi and I decided that when double checking the online reservations we should circle the entire booking option if there are no inquiries, and highlight only those which call for our attention. That way nothing slips through the cracks. Learned all about Room Service tonight and Steps new menu! Room 302 moved to 324 due to the rusty water issue. Morgan please remind housekeeping that 302 needs to be cleaned.Thanks T!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    March 1st, 2008 at 8:28 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome to the team, Gio!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 9:47 pm\r\n\r\n    STAFF MEETINGS\r\n\r\n    Bird Rock all staff (Elena, Tory, Kaitlyn & HK) on Thursday 3/27, noon, at Bird Rock if possible.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS Front Desk (all of us, even those who will migrate down the street) on Sunday, 3/30, 2 PM\r\n\r\n    These meetings are mandatory, please be there.\r\n\r\n    ONLINE RESERVATIONS/UNIREZ RESERVATIONS\r\n    As of today, please print a hard copy of each incoming online reservation and UNIREZ reservation. Process the reservation in WRP as usual, highlight the possible add-ons (massage, whale watch, etc.) & initial the hard copy and put in basket by back desk.\r\n    Then double check reservations (other people made), initial again and file in file cabinet under my printer (like we used to with Inntopia & webervation).\r\n    I hope by having 2 sets of eyes on each reservation we won’t miss add-ons.\r\n\r\n    Gio started training today. Welcome to the team!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 3:07 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Friday….\r\n    Pool roof is looking GOOD, amazing enough (JK) the wood is rotting around the windows on the ceiling. J I am going to see if Jared will come and fix it. Then the roofers will be back to put the flashing on.\r\n    Let’s start to put out the bikes when it is nice. Can someone wipe them down, and check the tires, handle bars etc. this weekend?\r\n    #310 is out of service, we are trying to fix the table in there with the scratches on it, if we absolutley need that room, just make sure we change out the table in there in the mean time. If you don’t need it, it is marked out until Tuesday.\r\n    Have a good weekend.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 29th, 2008 at 2:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi all,\r\n\r\n    I’m back from Vegas. No, I didn’t win lots o’ money, but then I didn’t gamble, so…\r\n\r\n    Spring is in the air and the phones are ringing, so everyone remember to keep that smile on your face and in your voice, even in the face of chaos and adversity. Just remember that you ROCK!\r\n\r\n    Oh, and by the way, just like Steffi said NO DOWNLOADING!! This is VERY important. Even the smallest thing, like downloading a screen saver can wreak havoc and cost us lots of money. Thank you for respecting this.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2008 at 7:24 pm\r\n\r\n    107\r\n    Door doesn’t open. I blocked it out until Seth is back. The lock blinks green, but pressing the handle doesn’t disengage the lock, seems to be a mechanical problem.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Please remember to let everybody know about the pool closure. I went through upcoming reservations and found several who didn’t know.\r\n\r\n    STEPS\r\n    Has a new menu out. I’ll replace them on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    CHECKING OUT GUESTS\r\n    Don’t forget to check out guests in WRP after 3 PM.\r\n\r\n    KAITLYN\r\n    Great job on Bird Rock reservation #1039804. I’ll leave it up to you to follow up on all the add-ons. Keep me posted.\r\n\r\n    UNIQUE EXPERIENCE\r\n    I had the dubious pleasure to remove a tick from my dog’s manhood yesterday. That is something I don’t do every day!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 28th, 2008 at 3:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Flowers were ordered for the wrong date for room 325, Cindy knows and has settled with Robin they will be re-delivered tomorrow, I will drop the vase they came in off at robin’s to be reused.\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    February 27th, 2008 at 3:18 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey there. Today I learned a lot…again. We have a reservation for Bird Rock Hotel coming up in May. I printed out an information sheet on it and put it in Steffi’s box. (cause I don’t have one up here) Sorry Steffi. You can place elsewhere if you can’t stand the smell of it. he he he Reservation number 1039804. If anyone has any questions you can ask me. There is another reservation inquiry in Steffi’s box for a group of people in June to stay at Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    I found it really handy to have blank paper next to my station when answering phone and doing odd tasks. My head is spinning. Otherwise a good day. The roof for the pool is coming down. HoooHA!\r\n\r\n    see you next week!\r\n    Kaitlyn\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 26th, 2008 at 10:55 pm\r\n\r\n    MINI-ROMANCE PACKAGE\r\n    Please call the florists in the morning to arrange our usual bouquet for reservation #1039605. They have also ordered some champagne so please make sure we set aside a bottle for them.\r\n    NOISE COMPLAINTS\r\n    Some guests in Building “A” complained about some of the construction guys staying here. I went up and had a talk with them. They were hanging out in the parking lot drinking. I haven’t heard anything from anybody after the talking to. Guest #1035301 was the person who called me. She may want to talk to someone in the morning but I doubt it.\r\n    REGINO\r\n    I didn’t mark it out because it is already shut down during the roofing but, Regino will be in 307 for the next 2 nights.\r\n    CONFERENCE ROOM\r\n    I couldn’t find my camera’s cable today so I will email y’all a picture or two of the conference room tomorrow. That way we can send it off to the folks who are interested in using it for a wedding.\r\n    Well that’s about it. I’m gonna go sleep my weekend away and try to get rid of this dang cold. Laters!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 26th, 2008 at 1:59 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi everyone,\r\n    Pool Roof, Wednesday is the day Savage is starting to reroof the pool building. I have blocked out 301-307, 314, 320,321, 322, 326, 327 for Wed, Thurs, Fri, I don’t want the guests to be disturb by the noise, on Friday I will find out what day the workers will be back and make adjustments for the upcoming week.\r\n    Centurytel is working on our voice mail problem, The are also checking into why Girl Friday is not getting our overflow calls.\r\n    Priscilla, Alex and Chad need a decorator, can you please assist them in their new apartment:) (don’t tell them I said anything) HAHA\r\n    Please remember to tell people that are making reservations that we are putting a new roof on the pool, suggest to everyone that the back building A is the best choice for noise level. If they don’t mind book them in any other room. Please honor the water room price in a earth room until the roof is complete. We are still looking at the end of March for the pool to reopen.\r\n    Thanks for all your attention, remember not to do school work at work.\r\n    Thanks,\r\n    Cindy\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 25th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    NO DOWNLOADING\r\n    Guys, please don’t download games, screen savers, etc. As I said before, we make our living on-line, so let’s not endanger that by catching a virus (somebody is using my email account to spam from, right now, I get about 50 emails a minutes, not funny, I called Chris).\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Please work on the floor plans for the Wind Place and the Hideaway as soon as you can, thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 24th, 2008 at 8:13 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please read email in in-box regarding a picture of the conference center. Can you take a picture and send it to them, please?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    All future arrivals through March have been informed of the pool being under construction.\r\n\r\n    SPPP\r\n    (Steffi’s personal perfume problem). Just a reminder: we are entering the time of the year were we are many people in the office again and it’s not warm enough to leave the doors open yet. Please remember that I have real issues (nausea, headaches, nosebleeds, ears ringing, can’t concentrate) with too much perfume & hairspray. Please consider me when getting ready for work and please don’t use perfume or hairspray in the office or our bathroom. Thank you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 22nd, 2008 at 7:40 pm\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Check it out, our website is up: http://www.birdrockhotel.com. The phones are ringing off the hooks, very cool. So remember, the 5800 number is most likely somebody inquiring for Bird Rock, answer accordingly.\r\n\r\n    AIR CONDITION\r\n    I called the guest with the air condition question, Priscilla. Just a reminder, all rooms in building B & D have air condition.\r\n\r\n    EMAIL\r\n    Girls, please don’t forget to deal with the front desk emails on my computer during your shifts. File the confirmation letters & online reservations (after you processed them), answer the questions people have & always sign your name, forward emails you don’t know what to do with (complaints, group inquiries) to Cindy & I or leave in the in-box if there is no time pressure on the questions.\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    will be off island Saturday & Sunday, so we are on our own in case of emergencies.\r\n    FH Freight came, all is in the Beaverton Valley facility (#29), which is full now. Ben & Seth dealt with the plumbing shipment, it’s all in the Roche Harbor facility.\r\n\r\n    What a gorgeous day! When I woke up this morning Mr. Esspike had his bikini on and a drink with an umbrella in his paw, laying on the porch.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 21st, 2008 at 3:19 pm\r\n\r\n    **********\r\n    The woman in rm 325 (who brought her pet rats) is staying for the second night tonight but has yet to pay due to some money issues(basically she is overdrawn in her account). Her husband is depositing money tonight and so she has been assured by her bank that the money will show in her account by tomorrow. I was able to cancel her 60-min side-by-side massage without charge(pheeww!) I have a copy of her credit card.\r\n    This morning she mis dialed 911 twice, one of the deputies came by and went to check on her.\r\n    She also showed me pictures of her rats (by the elements logo) because she intends to e-mail them to us later in case we want to use them on our website for our pet-friendly page.\r\n\r\n    *****Big Delivery*****\r\n    if all goes well we will get a delivery of about 18 couches, chairs, sofas etc from Friday Harbor Freight will deliver them and Seth knows, so call him when they get here.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 20th, 2008 at 10:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Shift went well, the stuffed raccoon made its way onto the bed for our arriving guests. their room still needs to be charged, the woman maxed out her daily spending limit today so it was declined. They are here for a few days and Steffi okayed it.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN Don’t worry about the radio anymore, Techie Chris and Steffi already fixed it.\r\n\r\n    Question: Are rooms 341, 338, and 336 all air conditioned??? Just double checking for a guest #1028844 who called back to make sure. i told them i would check and confirm in a brief email back.\r\n\r\n    FOR RAQUEL Have you found a cell phone? Perhaps and silver verizon wireless Envy (they have the full keyboard) if so, contact Chad Hesman, i put a phone number on a sticky note near the whiteboard.\r\n\r\n    MORGAN Thanks for the keychain from Vegas…its totally awesome, I love it!!\r\n\r\n    If Adam’s back I would like to pass along a “welcome home” and that i heard Jack Johnson has a new CD, maybe a possibility for an updated Summer playlist..hint hint ;)\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 2:28 pm\r\n\r\n    GLITCH IN THE MATRIX\r\n    O.K. guys, this is very important: NOBODY is going to refund any guests until further notice.\r\n\r\n    There is something wrong with WRP, I’m waiting for them to call me back. Elena refunded a guest (#1025567) and it all looks correct on paper and on screen, but when you actually go through the settled transactions, it was a charge, not a refund. So the poor man, who had a mediocre time to say the least, was then charged twice for a couple’s massage he never received. If you need to refund, refer to me, I’ll be back Friday after 3PM.\r\n    I am ready for my weekend.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 19th, 2008 at 9:40 am\r\n\r\n    POOL POOL POOL POOL\r\n    Guests arriving after 2/20/08 have not been promised health club coupons (exceptions: see guest remarks). We have to fade them out, can’t afford it. So for now, don’t push them on people, give out if they ask only.\r\n    And please please please don’t forget to mention to every new reservation (not only phone reservations, online reservations as well) that the pool house is out of order (definitely until 3/15/08, give warning to guest arriving in late March).\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Can you play around with the receiver and the I-tunes, I can’t get the music to play. Let the music play…\r\n    We haven’t heard anything from the Ipod radio people, can you follow up on that, please?\r\n    We are expecting a large shipment from FH Freight, please call Seth upon arrival.\r\n    Please work on the pool trouble shooting list (just kidding, ha, ha!).\r\n    Good to have you back, see you Friday.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2008 at 8:02 pm\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Laura asks if you could please create floor plans of the Hideaway & the Wind Place by Thursday (hideaway keys in my lower file cabinet, call Dave to make sure it’s not rented) and then call her. As soon as that’s done, we can get the new website up, yeah! Her Oregon number is on the board above my computer.\r\n\r\n    RAQUEL\r\n    is off Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday. Please call Regino for HK. If he is not on the property, Olga will have R’s phone.\r\n\r\n    ME ME ME\r\n    I’ll take my weekend Wednesday & Thursday. Call me at home for front desk issues.\r\n\r\n    WEDNESDAY\r\n    Please remind Seth and/or Regino to take the seats out of the van, so Ben can take it off-island to get things for Bird Rock.\r\n\r\n    THURSDAY\r\n    When Ben comes back Thursday night, please park and lock van, it will be unloaded Friday morning.\r\n\r\n    SUSHI\r\n    made it! He is so easy to talk to. He ate well, every other day. We became really close. Mr. Esspike is a little jealous.\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Morgan & Adam, we missed you. Tell us travel stories!\r\n    Kaitlyn Says:\r\n    February 18th, 2008 at 10:51 am\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    could you double check the rate on the folks in the wind place from this weekend 2-18. They said they had an adjustment due to road noise. Not sure who they spoke to about this. Could you send them and e-mail letting them know that we adjusted their rate? Or show me how?\r\n\r\n    By the way…learning lots on the new system. Crazy time!!\r\n    kj\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2008 at 9:58 pm\r\n\r\n    SETH\r\n    Was Johnny Depp on the spot this morning with the bikes, thank you so much. Only #1 & #7 are still out of order.\r\n\r\n    LA MUSICA\r\n    Donde estas? I can’t get the receiver in my office to work, is it me? Elena & Kaitlyn, maybe you can sing for our guests tomorrow morning?\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    If any of the future reservations I called want to cancel or reschedule, please let them without penalty.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 17th, 2008 at 2:21 pm\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL REQUEST:\r\n    Steffi, lovely can you put a bottle of champagne in room 217 this evening at 8:00PM or before Tori leaves? A card that goes with the champagne is already made and the champagne is chilling.\r\n\r\n    SPA APP.\r\n    Steffi the spa returned your call about the massage appointment for John Pearce. They have 2 appointments available at 9:00am and one at 10:30am.\r\n\r\n    UH OH!\r\n    A guy came in today and said that we should look at blocking off the drop off by the guest laundry, which is directly behind some of the parking spots of the Sky places. Apparently he went down it and scratched up the side of his car pretty bad. He asked that I pass this along.\r\n\r\n    LETTER ON BACK DESK:\r\n    Raquel had me write out a letter for Rosa Garcia- Soto (one of the housekeepers). The letter basically says that she is fired and explains the reason, She needs to sign one of the copies, she can keep one and the signed one is for Cindy to file away.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 9:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Ladies & Gentleman,\r\n    we have one rentable room left for the night and I keep getting phone inquiries.\r\n\r\n    HK REPORT\r\n    Please make sure to print the entire HK report tomorrow, not some short version (pets, early departures, etc.)\r\n\r\n    BIKES\r\n    Please find a list of rentable bikes (#8, #3, #2) on the back desk, use the list to keep track (don’t forget to have everybody sign a release form). I called Seth and asked him to stop by early and pump up the low air ones and break the locks of the bikes we can’t open. Rent them without locks unless somebody really wants one (there are three functioning ones by the helmets). Please ask Raquel if she knows where the air pumps went.\r\n\r\n    ADD-ONs\r\n    We had several reservations today, who had added massages online and nobody followed up on it. Whenever you process a reservation, make sure you read through the list of add-ons, check the pricing, WRP adds the prices of add-ons to the room. When you have a second, go through the check-ins of the following days and see if everything necessary had been done. For example #1029276, check-in for tomorrow, selected: Massage: not sure, call me. So please call him in the morning.\r\n\r\n    COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION\r\n    #1024482 had come in earlier to inform us that he has sawdust in the bedroom and a clogged toilet. He was promised an i-pod radio for white noise. None of this had been followed up on. Keep a list, it’s that time of the year. Just a reminder: only the Sky Places have i-pod radios.\r\n\r\n    KAYAK TOURS\r\n    Discovery Sea kayak does tours all year around. Sunset tours, 3-4 hours, $79 per person, kids must be 13 or older.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    I’ll start calling future reservations about the pool closure tomorrow. I want everybody to please write in the guest remarks that a guest has been informed about the closure, when making a new reservation. The health club will be open 11 AM to 4 PM tomorrow and 6 AM to 8 PM Mo-Fri.\r\n\r\n    SUNDAY AFTERNOON FROM CINDY\r\n    Ben (my nephew) will be coming off of the ferry on Sunday afternoon with a load of plumbing stuff for the Bird Rock. When he calls please call Seth and let him know what time Ben will meet Seth at the Roche Harbor storage unit. Seth will have the keys to the unit. Ben may need directions on where it is, please ask Seth. Thanks, Cindy\r\n\r\n    Girls & Tory, you ROCK. Thank you so much for all your hard work. Be kind, keeps lists & multi-task away. See you at 2.\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 6:08 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh! if Savage Roofing sends in a fax…give it to Seth for him to look over and have him call Cindy. Thank you!\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 16th, 2008 at 6:06 pm\r\n\r\n    WOW!\r\n\r\n    almost felt like summer today, walked in at 12:30 and Elena had already had two rushes. Rest of the day went fairly smoothly, other than some misplaced spa appointments. It really is time to get organized and prepare for the season.\r\n\r\n    This morning Red Cross brought in a guest whose home was flooded last night. We put the bill in Cindy’s box to take care of.\r\n\r\n    Tori came into train more…yay!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    ELENA\r\n    Can you please print out more Health Club vouchers, we’ll need them.\r\n    Thank you. See you at 3.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 8:47 pm\r\n\r\n    Wow, is it summer? 33 check-ins tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Change in plans: Priscilla will show up at 12.30 tomorrow.\r\n\r\n    Read the notes of #1026289 and let HK know if they bring a pet.\r\n\r\n    EMERALD GLASS\r\n    Type Emerald Glass in the search field of WRP and read notes on the existing 3 reservations. The owner was upset because one of us told her she had a direct bill account. Please remember that Cindy and only Cindy decides who has a direct bill account. Refer guests wishing for a direct bill arrangement to her.\r\n    Then she called yesterday and added 3 people to the list of people who can make reservations for the company and that information was not recorded anywhere. So, below find instructions on how to make reservations for them and please be consistent and informed, the next time somebody from the company calls.\r\n    When one of the four people authorized to make reservations for Emerald Glass calls: write “Emerald Glass” into the search window in WRP. Click on one of the old reservations, hit the “copy” button (this will transfer not only the contact info, but also the guests remarks and the credit card info), then proceed to make a reservation for the dates and number of rooms requested. Please ask for the worker’s names (write them into the “additional guest” area), charge 10% write email and put remainder on card on file upon arrival. Does this makes sense to everybody? As always, ask me, when you see me.\r\n\r\n    I hired Sheryl today, she will start training on 2/28 and will be part time. Welcome Sheryl! We almost got our crew together for this season, yeah!\r\n\r\n    Thank you, Morgan, for Johnny Depp! Oh man, look at those cheek bones, miau.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 2:30 pm\r\n\r\n    So much news. Are you all taking all of this in? If not, don’t be shy, ask lots of questions, and re-read it until you understand it.\r\n\r\n    Next week, we will be getting two furniture shipments in for Bird Rock. Whoever is working the front desk, please contact Seth to coordinate where to deliver the products. If you have any questions, you can try to contact me on my cell, but I will be in Central Oregon and may be out of cell range. You can always email me, though. I check that often.\r\n\r\n    Happy mid-winter break!!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 2:05 pm\r\n\r\n    Pool\r\n    The pool will be out of commission for at least another 2-3 weeks. The roof has to be replaced before we can forward with the sheet rock and the painting. Dave Payne will be starting the roof on Monday 2-18, I will remind him to not start earlier than 9am, and let’s try and not have anyone in 301-307 for the first week, or at least let’s tell the guests what to expect prior to them arriving. Make sure all upcoming reservation from the 18th thru March 3 know about the delay in the pool.\r\n    Onity (key lock system)\r\n    Gary and his crew finished doing a once over, through all the locks on the property, all of them have been fixed except for a couple that we are going to have to wait until replacements come for them.\r\n    Windplace: Has a defective lock on the front door of the house and the lock going out to the front porch from the bedroom. A new lock has been ordered\r\n    Room #117: Lock is defective and I have blocked out that room until we receive the new lock\r\n    312/314: Need some fixing but, they are still working now. They have also had new locks ordered.\r\n    Wednesday Feb 20, 2008\r\n    Ben Krieg, my nephew is going to pick up the keys for the van, and he is going to take it to Bellingham (per Laura) to pick up the reset of the plumbing fixtures for Bird Rock. Could you please have Seth or Regino take out as many seats as possible. He will return on Thursday, and will need to have someone deliver all of the product out of the van into one of the storage units.\r\n    Have a great week. Thanks for holding down the fort while I am gone.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 15th, 2008 at 11:58 am\r\n\r\n    GREETINGS\r\n    Hello from sunny, cold, and windy Las Vegas! Rache ad I have been traveling all over the place ans seeing as much as possible. Being outside isn’t much fun. Las Vegas is having the worse winds in over 10 years. It was gusting to almost 70mph the other night. Stuff was being blown around and you will see in one of my photos, part of the Paris Hotel balloon was blown off. Speaking of photos. I may not have them up until I get back. The Stratosphere has the worse internet system I have ever had in a hotel. Not only did they charge an arm and a leg to have it. The speeds are like being on dial-up again. I am sooo glad our internet at ELEMENTS is free ad speedy. Honestly, you’d think a near billion dollar hotel could have decent internet. Let’s hear it for us little guys. I am going to keep trying to post but at least I got a pic of Johnny Depp up for Steffi. Talk to you all soon. Remember, email me if you want anything special from Sin City. LATERS!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 14th, 2008 at 9:22 pm\r\n\r\n    THIS WEEKEND\r\n    We will be busy. Kaitlyn & Priscilla will be our back-up girls as follows:\r\n    Kaitlyn will stay until after the 3.35 ferry tomorrow, Priscilla will arrive before 5.00 and stick it out for the next two ferries with me.\r\n    On Saturday Kaitlyn will help Elena from 12.30 to 4.30, Priscilla will be on call for me. On Sunday and Monday Kaitlyn will help Elena from 9 to 1. Thank you, guys.\r\n\r\n    BIRD ROCK\r\n    Both the FHI & the Bird Rock website, which should be up by next week, don’t say anymore that we are still remodeling. We are shooting for 4/1/08 for opening. Please refer guests to ELEMENTS until then. Also: The Orca & the San Juan suite will have aireated tubs as opposed to jetted tubs, after the remodel. Laura will change the rate sheet to reflect this change soon.\r\n\r\n    NEW BOOKINGS SECTION\r\n    Please check the “New Bookings” section frequently, so you don’t miss alarms or don’t forget to process reservations. There were a bunch of reservations today, some processed but not email confirmed and still marked “new”, some not processed at all. Tis that time of the year: keep a list for the day, so you finish projects during which you got interrupted, communicate rather more than less, check and reply to emails, check phone messages and the “new bookings” section feverishly every time you have a second. Please don’t drop the ball.\r\n\r\n    BOOM TIME GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    We got a couple of online gift certificates today. One, 5004, couldn’t be processed because the credit card was declined. It’s still in in-box, reservation in WRP is made (#5004), left msg with purchaser, just needs to be paid.\r\n    Reminder: once a boom time gift certificate comes in the email: click on boom time, sign in (password saved), click on the credit card icon next to the purchaser’s name and transfer the credit card info into a new reservation in WRP (kind of like we used to with Innoptias). In WRP change room status to “Gift certificate only”, use boom time gift cert. number as confirmation number, write in guest remarks: boom time gift cert., purchaser’s name and amount, make it out to “A Special Guest”.\r\n    Change room price to gift cert. amount (tax exempt amount)and charge card.\r\n    Then confirm purchase with boom time and write the gift certificate in our hard copy folder under the front desk.\r\n    Got that? This is one I want to show you. Please remind me the next time we work together.\r\n\r\n    NEW\r\n    We hired Gia & Khaili today. Khaily will start to train 2/24 and will work Sunday morning back ups until school is out. Gia will start training 2/29 and will be full time once she is trained. Welcome aboard!\r\n\r\n    Happy VD everyone, thanks for all the love, Priscilla and all the candy, Cindy:)\r\n    Priscilla Says:\r\n    February 13th, 2008 at 10:51 pm\r\n\r\n    ♥ First, to say Happy St. VALENTINES’s day!! ♥\r\n\r\n    Busy weekend coming up with all the love birds.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for the schedule change Steffi, but if anyone can cover my shifts on the 7th and 9th that would be wonderful. I was invited to a conference over the weekend in Bellingham. If thats not possible, please let me know asap. Thank you!\r\n\r\n    Cindy, have fun in Big White, don’t let those boys have tooooo much fun ;) I’m sure they will behave for you.\r\n\r\n    Steffi, you always know about the most interesting stuff..winter breaks coming up and i could use a good book to snuggle up and read. oh and…the phone call to the dentist is in progress…yikes!!\r\n\r\n    MoMo, I can’t wait to see pics of Vegas, last time i was there i woke up in the back of my moms car in a gas station on the way to my uncles wedding in cali. Definitely not as much fun as you are having.\r\n\r\n    PS. Onity guys are here, and if Cindy’s not at work today remind Seth to take the van to the Lubeguy for an 11:00 appointment.\r\n\r\n    peace.\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 11th, 2008 at 12:37 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Howdy all! I just wanted to let you all know that I will be working on the pool as soon as I can get in there when I get back. Until then please tell everybody not to turn on the pool filter pumps while I am gone. If someone absolutely\r\n    has to, please make sure they put a couple of inches of water in the pool first. I have added a bunch of chemicals to the pool to try and stave off any major growth during my absence. I hope to only take about 3 days getting the pool up and going once I get in there. I plan on emptying almost all the water out and scrubbing the heck out of the bottom before refilling it and balancing the chemicals. I am going to leave a list of items I will need from Gerard. Can someone please make sure anything they deliver gets put by the pile of chemical buckets in the pool house? Thanks.\r\n\r\n    iPOD RADIOS\r\n    If someone from iHome calls for me about the iPod docks, send them to Laura or Cindy. All in all, we need 320 & 308’s radio repaired/replaced (item # iH4B). We also need to order a couple of spare power supply cables (item # iAD25B). Laura also wants 5 of the larger radios for Fridays (item # iH9BR). 320’s radio is in the office, 308’s is still in the room. 309 needs a power supply cable.\r\n\r\n    FEDEX\r\n    We just got a delivery of a whole bunch of FedEx shipping supplies. We now have a nice assortment of padded envelopes, soft tyvek envelopes, and cardboard envelopes. We also have a stack of shipping forms and the self-stick clear plastic sleeves they go in. This bounty of shipping delights can be found on the floor in Steffi’s office underneath the shelves. ( Or at least until she gets tired of it being there and finds a better spot)\r\n\r\n    SUSHI\r\n    I will be leaving my Betta in the office with Steffi while I am gone. He only needs to be fed a little bit every other day. If he is hungry he will usually get all excited by someone walking near his bowl.\r\n\r\n    OTHER\r\n    Keep an eye on my Flickr site (click on my name above this post). I hope to try and update it if I take any cool photos whilst in Vegas. Someone please break then news to Seth that I am sorry and I will not be going into any strip clubs and I doubt they would let me take a camera in there anyway. I will be back to work on the 20th so everybody take it easy. email/call me if there is anything you would like me to get for you.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 10th, 2008 at 8:36 pm\r\n\r\n    I POD RADIOS\r\n    Morgan did an inventory and contacted the applicable repair company. What you’ll need to know: 320 & 308 don’t have functioning Ipod radios right now and 309’s power cable is missing.\r\n\r\n    LOST & FOUND\r\n    Just a reminder: whenever HK finds something in a guest room, they’ll attach a lost & found form to that day’s HK report. For example today some toys were found in 309. So when a guest calls to inquire about a lost item, go through the HK report of her check out date first, if there is no note attached, call Raquel anyway and don’t forget to follow up with the guest.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S BOOK TIP\r\n    “Spook Country” by William Gibson. You know Gibson from “Neuromancer” and “Jonny Memnonic”. Gibson, who lives on Vancouver Island, seized to write Science Fiction, it’s not necessary anymore, he says. Every technology described in his newest book is not only possible but in use right now, scary. The book is about Hollis, a former rock star, who now tries to make her living by writing. She is on assignment to write about a new art form, utilizing GPS devices and certain helmets. One goes to a place, in this case the Viper Room in L.A., puts on this helmet and sees River Phoenix laying dead in the streets. But why does the guy making this possible, technologically, not want to be interviewed, and what’s with the Cuban Russians and their I-pods, and why does this cop, Brown, hold a Russian speaking drug addict prisoner…?\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 9th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    The new schedule is up.\r\n    Please look everybody, slight changes for all.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 8th, 2008 at 8:16 pm\r\n\r\n    GROUPS GROUPS GROUPS\r\n    Cindy printed out all group names for 2008 (above my computer, please always put back). So when somebody calls, saying he is part of a group, grab the file real quick and see if we have an arrangement with that group, look it up in WRP by name or go to the group folios and look it up by date. See what the arrangement is and make the reservation for the guest.\r\n\r\n    VMCCA\r\n    For example will come 9/21/08 and their guests are starting to call in. First, ask the guest if he wants to stay one or two nights (the group reservations are for one night, but a guest may tag on another night for the same rate), then ask what type of room he wants. Adjust an existing VMCCA reservation accordingly by going to “c”. Then continue to make a regular reservation, name, cc info, etc, take 10% deposit and send confirmation. I adjusted the room rate to the correct price already. As always, let me show you when we work together, and ask me questions.\r\n\r\n    SPA\r\n    Changed their relaxation massages to Swedish massages, their therapeutic massages to Deep Tissue. It’s the same thing, just a name change.\r\n    They also have an open house on Friday, 2/15 from 7-9. Art and 15 min free massages, tell our guests and check it out yourself.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Just a reminder: please don’t forget to let all guests know about our pool situation when they make a reservation for the next couple of weeks.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    NO PERSONAL CHECKS\r\n    Just a reminder: we don’t take personal checks (or third party business checks for that matter) as payment, just visa, master, cash and Traveler’s Checks.\r\n\r\n    POOL\r\n    Cindy called all upcoming reservations. In some cases she simply asked for a call back, without stating the issue. if you get a call from a guest arriving in the next 2 weeks, please let them know about our pool issues, offer to cancel or move the reservation at no charge, mention the health club if needed. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    IPOD radio in 330\r\n    What’s the situation? Has anybody followed up on this? Who do we call? Please let me know.\r\n\r\n    ALARMS\r\n    Thank you Priscilla for creating alarms on unfinished reservations. One thing: if the reservation is far out, like in May or so, make the alarm for a week before arrival, not for today. If it’s for the next couple of weeks, start to process it: leave message with spa, guest, etc.\r\n\r\n    NAME conference in July\r\n    One of us (no signature on email, please always sign your name) quoted a woman making a reservation for July a 10% discount, because she is part of a conference called NAME. As far as I know we don’t have any such arrangement, Cindy?\r\n    If you are in doubt about a group or a discount, please let the guest know that you aren’t sure, that you will find out and call back. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Who threw out my hot sauce and why?\r\n\r\n    FILM TIP OF THE DAY\r\n    If you need a break from the primaries, watch “V for Vendetta”, la lucha continua!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 4:49 pm\r\n\r\n    P.S. Elena great work with the drawings! I’m going to review them tonight and hopefully we’ll get them uploaded to the new web page soon.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 4:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Elena (and everyone) just a reminder not to put guest names into this log, just the reservation number. I just changed your recent post to fix this. Thanks!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    February 7th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    981615:\r\n    The water in their tub was running brown so I moved them to 312, since they were a late check-in I charged them this morning on separate reservations since I don’t know how to split a reservation yet by moving only one night. They have two keys so everything is set for them.\r\n\r\n    POOL:\r\n    Cindy called upcoming guests today to let them know about our pool closure remember we still have handy health club passes in the basket next to the card machine.\r\n    Prissy Says:\r\n    February 6th, 2008 at 10:37 pm\r\n\r\n    Hello Hello,\r\n\r\n    Theres a list by the phone that I started. This list is everyone who will be staying with us through feb. 18. Cindy would like us to call these people and say a little “We’re looking forward to your stay, but unexpectedly the pool house is closed and we would like to let you know. To accommodate for this we are offering our guests free vouchers to the private health and fitness club one block away….etc…” if anyone doesn’t want to stay, they will face no punishment. I got to Feb. 12 and then started slopping up my messages. When they have been contacted please put a check next to the reservation so we do not call anyone twice.\r\n\r\n    Anyways, things are good and SENIOR life is starting to get busy…once again finals are up next week and then WINTER BREAK!! yay!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2008 at 3:47 pm\r\n\r\n    WSF\r\n    New info. We now have a master list of all the Washington State Ferry people who are allowed to book rooms for direct bill. Per Cindy, if anyone calls to make a reservation for a ferry worker they must be on that list if they want direct bill. If they are not on that list they must pay for the room themselves and get reimbursed on their own. A copy of the list is posted on the board above Steffi’s desk. Please initial it when you have taken a look. So no more being nice to stranded ferry workers late at night. WSF will refuse to pay for the rooms unless they are booked by someone on the list.\r\n    And now you know. :)\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    February 5th, 2008 at 12:04 pm\r\n\r\n    POOL CLOSURE\r\n    O.K. folks. Sorry to say but we are going to close the pool for the remainder of the week. Hopefully it will reopen for the weekend but more than likely we will have to close it again come Monday. The guys from West Mechanical will be fixing/replacing/augmenting the duct work for the dehumidifier and some drywall work will probably need to be done once they are finished. So here is the deal… The pool door will be “Blocked.” We now have “Blocking Cards.” These card disable a lock so that it cannot be used by guests/housekeeping. Cindy has one, the Mechanical guys will have one, and I will have one. To use it slide the blocking card into the lock and remove. The red light should flash. Room keys, pool keys, and master keys should not work now. To get back into the building you must use the block card again and then use your master key. So please, if you are opening shift. Check to make sure that the pool door is locked. Check again when the mechanical guys are done for the day. Just take a pool key with you when you go out to turn off/turn on the outdoor lights. THANKS! We’ll keep you posted on when/if the pool will reopen for the weekend.\r\n    SAN JUAN ISLAND FITNESS CENTER\r\n    We now have some vouchers for the fitness center. They are on the back desk next to the key maker. One voucher per guest, per day. Write the guest’s name on the line and put their reservation # on it somewhere. The pool schedule is one the back of the voucher. The voucher gives them access to the entire facility for a day. It costs us ~$20 per person to use the fitness center so please only hand them out if you “need” to. Try to keep the guests as happy as you can. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n    Mo\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2008 at 8:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Yikes, we have an event in the conference center tomorrow, noon to 5. I left a message with the guest, let’s see how it goes. Shall we block it out during the garden construction?\r\n\r\n    I fixed the sauna, after Morgan told me how: if the sauna’s “on” button is not responding or the LED’s are blinking, unscrew the casing, press the “program” button, then the up and down arrows to the right time, then hit set. Once the buttons stop blinking, hit the sauna’s “on” button, that did the trick. Morgan, how about that pool trouble shooting list? I made a list of possible issues and put it in your folder on my computer.\r\n\r\n    Reconciled cash, all is good, but: you guys, please drop your cash. When you have cash income, print out the guest invoice, put cash & invoice in an envelope, date and initial the envelope and drop in safe. Then count the cash drawer you have been working out of. This would really make my life easier. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    Zoe and Mia\r\n    won so many awards at their swimming competition yesterday, that they forgot one of the awards. A friend dropped it off, it’s on Laura’s desk. You go, girls!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 3rd, 2008 at 10:53 am\r\n\r\n    Just a reminder, landscaping outside building B starts tomorrow. More of the transformation from parking lot to garden oasis!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 2nd, 2008 at 8:45 pm\r\n\r\n    ALARMS & REQUESTS/REMARKS\r\n    Please read online reservations carefully to make sure you don’t miss a request for massages, whale watch tours, etc.\r\n    Please indicate the status of the request in the “request/remarks” field as in: “wants whale watch on May 2 for 2 ad, fee added, not confirmed, voucher needed, 2/2/08 sw” & create an alarm for several days earlier with the same message, in case somebody forgets to follow up on it, we still catch it a couple of days ahead of arrival.\r\n    If you are the person following up, change the message in the “request/remarks” field according to the progress, as in: has whale watch with Maya’s Charters, 5/2, 1 PM, fee added, voucher needed, 2/3/08 sw.\r\n    Please please don’t forget to change the alarm accordingly.\r\n    And please please make those vouchers, unless the trip is months away and things might change.\r\n    Once everything is done, fee added, confirmed, voucher made, turn the alarm off.\r\n\r\n    TORI\r\n    trained today, went very well. Welcome to the crew, Tori:)\r\n\r\n    Had lot’s of walk-ins today, yeah!\r\n\r\n    I can’t find the front desk cell phone. I hope Morgan didn’t bring it with him to Seattle by accident.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 8:19 pm\r\n\r\n    Yeah, the cornstarch cups and garbage bags are here!!\r\n\r\n    Check it out, you guys, our new cups for the coffee station and the garbage bags we will use from now on are all 100% biodegradable (you can throw them in your compost pile) and won’t harm the environment like plastic bags and cups, which take at least 100 years to break down in a landfill (nobody really knows, because we have only used plastic commercially for 90 years and it’s all still there, oh man). Thank you so much, Cindy, for sourcing those.\r\n\r\n    On a similar subject: Valentine’s Day is coming up.\r\n    Flowers are the most toxic & pesticide intensive crops on earth, coming mostly from countries like Colombia, with labor laws poor at best. Plus more than 40% of the world’s conventional (i.e. non-organic, non fair trade) chocolate comes from the Ivory Coast where the State Department and World Labor Organizations have reported wide spread instances of child slavery. So: why not buy your Sweety organic, fair trade chocolate (uhh, soo good) and check out the Organic Consumer Organization for a great list of organic flower companies and other good-for-everybody gift ideas.\r\n\r\n    Aaand, back to work: Morgan, can you check with Raquel tomorrow about cleaning the rooms we had blocked out for the winter in building A? We released the rooms today but it wasn’t clear to me from the HK report which ones are ready to go. Also: can you ask her for some herbal tea for our coffee station? Thank you. Have fun at the game, make us win!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 6:31 pm\r\n\r\n    Regarding things coming in the mail/Fedex/UPS, etc… We will be getting quite a bit of “stuff” over the next few weeks that will eventually be going over to Bird Rock. Please make sure to let ME know when anything comes in so that I can keep track of it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 6:29 pm\r\n\r\n    Thanks every one for the very nice birthday wishes. I was really touched…I know, I know I am a bit touched…in the head already. Anyhow, thank you!\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    February 1st, 2008 at 11:05 am\r\n\r\n    Good Friday Morning :)\r\n    A few things will arrive in a week or so and I want to make sure you all know where they belong. I have ordered a new table for room 312, it will be shipped from Target. I have also ordered new window blinds for the front doors of 312 and 314. Please let me know when these items come in.\r\n    The fans are running in the pool room, which are making a HUGE difference, yes Morgan they are noisy, BUT,, so much better than walking into a rain zone.. West Mechanical will be working in the pool starting next Wednesday, Jared Payne will be building a plank to go over the pool on Monday, so that WM can access the ceiling. I hesitate to give out the bad news to people who are coming during that time to quickly though because WM said that every afternoon when they are finished for the day, they should be able to move their stuff out of the way, so that the pool can reopen. How about this, for Monday and Tuesday we keep it closed, (since Jared will be building in there)Wednesday we see how it goes with WM and then determine the follow week by that. We will be able to give out passes to the Health Club for any unhappy guests who want to swim and workout. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask me..\r\n    Happy Friday…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 31st, 2008 at 9:41 pm\r\n\r\n    NWDBC – GROUP\r\n    Northwest Regional Development for Biology Meeting at the labs will be held March 12 to 15. Participants of that group will stay with us and will receive a discount, depending on how many rooms we rent (between 10% and 20%, will be applied on day of arrival).\r\n    Please make reservations for that group as follows: if a guest identifies himself as a participant of NWDBC, type those letters in the search field of WRP, a group folio will show up. Open the group folio, go to “add new reservation” and make a reservation as usual, take deposit, send confirmation, etc. Don’t apply the discount yet.\r\n    If a guest identifies himself as a participant after you already made a reservation, finish the reservation as usual, write down confirmation number, then find the group folio, open it, click on “edit group folio”, scroll all the way down and type the confirmation number in the provided field under “add existing reservations”. Questions? Ask me.\r\n\r\n    A RING TRAVEL GROUP\r\n    Is a travel agency we have a contract with. They fax reservation requests, similar to the Clipper. When one arrives, make a reservation as usual (you’ll only get: guest name, how many guests, how many rooms, how many nights) and attach it to the corporate account “A Ring Travel”, then select the corporate rate when selecting a room. Finish the reservation as usual, only difference: don’t take deposit & press “suppress pricing on receipt”, something we need to get in the habit of doing for Clipper & Elderhostel as well.\r\n    Then, instead of emailing a confirmation (you won’t have an email address for the guest), write the confirmation number on the fax you received, date, sign and fax back to the agency (fax number is on the reservation request). Put faxed request in the box on the back desk for another person to double check. After the reservation has been double checked, file in “A Ring Travel” folder in my file cabinet.\r\n    Be careful with those. I had one today requesting 6 rooms all at once. Remind me to go over one of those with each of you. It’s much easier to show than describe.\r\n\r\n    PRISCILLA\r\n    I got your day off requests. Please always ask for the entire week off, not just your regular scheduled days, so I know not to schedule you at all, ever during those weeks. I want to hear you play sometime. Will you give me a concert in the lobby?\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 10:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Happy Thursday Everyone!!\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 3:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Please remember to let Housekeeping know that rooms 111 and 114 are dirty for tomorrow since the people did not leave until after noon.\r\n\r\n    HAPPY BIRTHDAY LAURA\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 30th, 2008 at 3:25 pm\r\n\r\n    Laura, Happy Birthday, have a WONDERFUL day:)\r\n    Priscilla ♥ Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2008 at 10:48 pm\r\n\r\n    Thank you boss lady’s for being the best ever!!!\r\n\r\n    LAURA..you know whats coming, Happy Birthday!\r\n\r\n    Steffi I read the 86st list, and added a nick name of my own :)\r\n\r\n    oh and by the way…your element’s employee quiz was incredibly hillarious\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 29th, 2008 at 11:21 am\r\n\r\n    FYI\r\n\r\n    New information about a change in whale watching and kayaking for summer. San Juan Safaris is downsizing and handing off all kayaking in Friday Harbor and Roche Harbor, and the whale watching out of Roche to San Juan Outfitters. San Juan Outfitters is a new company headed by Brian Goodremont, former San Juan Safaris employee. Until Brian gets his own website and phone line up and running we are to call San Juan Safaris regarding any kayaking from FH /RH or whale watching trips out of Roche.\r\n    Price List is as follows:\r\n    Whale Watching – $69.00 for Adults / $49.00 for Kids\r\n    Kayaking – $69.00 for a 3hr trip / $85.00 for a 5hr trip\r\n\r\n    I know this makes life a little bit more confusing for us but as soon as Brian has everything lined up we will have more information and be able to make specialized vouchers for San Juan Outfitters.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 27th, 2008 at 4:55 pm\r\n\r\n    GIFT CERTIFICATES\r\n    As of today, you will find two kinds of gift certificates in the basket on top of the safe: ELEMENTS hotel vouchers & spa, DSI, STEPS, FHH vouchers. The latter say “Gratuity not included” and have an extra line: “at”, to write where the voucher can be redeemed (i.e. at Lavendera Day Spa, or STEPS wine bar & cafe). So please use the ELEMENTS hotel vouchers for room gift certificates only. Use the others for massages and dining credits. Aaand, assemble some every shift, please!\r\n\r\n    MORGAN & CINDY\r\n    Please let Priscilla & Elena know where we blog now.\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY & WEDNESDAY\r\n    We have a massage workshop in the conference center. I’ll make sure the room is set up correctly. The organizer will show up right at 8 AM on Tuesday morning. Workshop participants will arrive throughout the next two days and may need to be picked up from the ferry (they will all travel with their massage tables). Regino knows, but please remind him.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S FILM TIP\r\n    I just finished watching Spike Lee’s “When the Levees broke”, a four part requiem for New Orleans, a documentary about Katrina and the 9 months afterwards. I was so impressed, I highly recommend it. What touched me most was the sense of place the people of this city have.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2008 at 11:39 pm\r\n\r\n    Morgan, I restarted guest computer, still no internet connection, can you fiddle around with that, please?\r\n    Happy shift, see you soon.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 26th, 2008 at 6:43 pm\r\n\r\n    THE DANCERS\r\n    Room 106 did check out after all. So the room needs to be cleaned, please let HK know. Room 206 came back and checked back in for another night. The organizer called, she had received a message from us that one party had brought a pet in a non-pet room, who was that?\r\n\r\n    #1007924\r\n    Morgan, is this a direct bill? No credit card and still in NEW section.\r\n\r\n    Happy “Showing of the baby Jesus” party, everyone. If you love me, bring me some food!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 11:04 pm\r\n\r\n    MORGAN\r\n    Please contact the spa and see if you can book a 60 min side by side Saturday late afternoon for # 1008543, if not, ask what they have Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n    Also: can you have Raquel get us some small garbage bags, I couldn’t find any.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 8:09 pm\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the tip, Adam.\r\n    Cindy, Dave and I are working on a scheme were we are trying to convince their boys to clean up last year’s storm damage on their property, cut it and I’ll buy it from them. But somehow the boys got wind of the fact that hauling and cutting wood is real hard work. We’ll see.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 7:52 pm\r\n\r\n    LAURA\r\n    The guy you took a reservation for today is not part of the U of WA group I made arrangements with, he is just part of a seminar on 3/12 and happens to stay with us, the other seminar is in fact on 4/12.\r\n\r\n    DONATIONS\r\n    need to be approved by Cindy or Laura. When putting a donation gift certificate into WRP, make the room status “gift certificate, room still available”, then write in the “guest remark” section for which room style the donation is, which organization we donated to, and the restrictions, then, and this is new:\r\n\r\n    make it a complimentary reservation\r\n\r\n    and don’t forget to write it down in the gift certificate log (under the front desk).\r\n\r\n    86st GUESTS\r\n    I created a word document on the desktop of my computer with above title. In it you’ll find the names & descriptions of guests who are no longer allowed on the premises and the reasons why. Please read it.\r\n\r\n    TODAY’S SONG IN MY HEAD\r\n    Spider Pig, by Homer Simpson, oh yeah.\r\n    “Can he jump from a web? No he can’t he’s a pig!”\r\n    That doesn’t even rhyme. I love it.\r\n    adam Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 7:34 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Steffi,\r\n\r\n    I just bought about a cord-and-a-half of nice firewood from a young man named Nick for $200. They stacked it all under my porch for an extra $20 (I tipped another $10 since it took three of them over an hour). Seems like the best firewood deal I’ve made in a while, so thought I’d pass on his number, in case you’re still looking. 317-5118. He said they had lots of wood.\r\n    Cindy Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 5:41 pm\r\n\r\n    Please remember to ask Steffi or I about the people we will no longer be letting stay at the hotel. There have been a few situations that happened and we do not allow that kind of behavior here.\r\n    Friday, are you glad it is here. I am Khaili gets to suit up for the girls varsity team tonight for a 6:00pm basketball game, she is excited although she is worried she may have to sit on the bench.. I doubt it, she is one tough cookie.\r\n    Birthday’s\r\n    Tomorrow is Dave’s 40th birthday….\r\n    Seth will be …. I think he told me 42yrs old, I highly doubt it I think he is trying to make me feel good:)\r\n    Happy Birthday to both of you wonderful people.\r\n    Next week we have one of our special people turning 41yrs old.. Guess who???? They really look 29…\r\n    The phones are ringing, ringing, and ringing again,,, YAHHHH…\r\n    It’s too busy now days to do any homework here at the office, so get your front desk hat on. Unless there is no phone calls at ALL… which we hope that is not the case.\r\n    We will know more about the pool building on Monday..\r\n    Onity should be coming in the next 2 weeks for the key cards.\r\n    Have a great weekend…\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    January 25th, 2008 at 9:44 am\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\n    Yes, this is the new location of the front-desk log. We decided yesterday that those rare guests with a robust curiosity about the inner workings of our hybrid hotel project, and enough time to exercise it to exhaustion, ought to be rewarded (punished?) with unrestricted access to our thought processes.\r\n\r\n    The theme here is “Warts and All.” Reading over the front desk log since we started it, what I see is heaps of evidence that you guys care deeply about the customer experience here. Sure, there are some embarrassing moments that most hotels would go to great lengths to conceal. ELEMENTS is not like that, though. I think it’s great for our guests to have the chance to see how we approach adversity and conflict, along with the warm fuzzy stuff. Please continue to speak freely, don’t censor yourself in any way; but do be careful to not include names, passwords or private information.\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS San Juan Island hotel & spa is a special place, refreshingly unlike any hotel or motel I’ve seen, and an open-access front-desk log is a perfect expression of our guest-first approach to lodging. Enjoy!\r\n    Morgan Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 3:16 pm\r\n\r\n    HoooKayy… Steffi. Apparently idle hands are the Devil’s playthings. “Kimono Nights” is not the name of the Anime series I am watching, only the episode on the disc. And in my defense, in case anyone has ideas to the contrary, it is not animated porn. Thank you and good night.\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 12:13 pm\r\n\r\n    Steffi,\r\n    You are a wonderful goofball! Clearly you have too much time on your hands.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    January 14th, 2008 at 11:04 am\r\n\r\n    ARE YOU A TRUE ELEMENTONIAN?\r\n    TAKE THE TEST TO FIND OUT:\r\n\r\n    1) How many gift certificates are you supposed to make per shift?\r\n    a) 4\r\n    b) I have too much homework to do to actually work at work\r\n    c) We make them?

I showed them some of our renovated rooms and they were really impressed.\r\n    Our crown jewel, building E, was their pet friendly rooms, because they were their oldest rooms. They barged building D here from Whidbey Island, it used to be an apartment building there. And they built the conference center on top of building B; it is free standing.\r\n    Another local couple stopped by earlier to see our conference center were they got married some 20 years ago. Now they are planning their daughter’s wedding.\r\n    I love that so much, Laura and Adam, that you kept the structure, quirky as it is. You are doing something really unique here.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    November 1st, 2007 at 2:45 pm\r\n\r\n    How was that Halloween party? The decorations were great!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    October 15th, 2007 at 6:25 pm\r\n\r\n    I heard a rumor about a staff Halloween party in a certain lobby of a certain sister hotel or ours? Is is true? Will we have one?\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    September 30th, 2007 at 1:03 pm\r\n\r\n    HI STEFFI AND EVERYONE!!!!\r\n\r\n    Thanks for the present Steffi, it is so cute!! I hope that the year goes well for everyone… I will be around and will probably see you all. Luv you guys!!!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    September 28th, 2007 at 10:54 pm\r\n\r\n    This Sunday is Rachael’s last shift (for now, I hope:)\r\n    I’m not sure I’ll survive the winter without you popping into the lobby, always exactly at the right moment, and putting something freshly baked on my desk.\r\n    Thank you so much for all your hard work. I remember the day you came back to ELEMENTS and I wanted to let you know all the little things which need to be done that day and you had tackled every single one already (it’s like riding a beach cruiser, no?)\r\n    Good luck with school, don’t be a stranger, I’ll miss you.\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    August 31st, 2007 at 6:15 pm\r\n\r\n    GOODBYE LILLY!!! HAVE FUN AT SCHOOL!!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2007 at 3:23 pm\r\n\r\n    Oh Lilly,\r\n    I’m gonna miss you. Your sense of humor is really something else (” the hotel is gonna be called “Log Book?”). Have a great time at college and don’t forget us, by which I mean: come and work for us next summer.\r\n    Love, Steffi\r\n    Lilly Says:\r\n    August 12th, 2007 at 12:04 pm\r\n\r\n    So I’m leaving soon :( …we need to have an end of the summer work party before I go, I don’t want to miss out!!\r\n    Laura Says:\r\n    August 2nd, 2007 at 9:06 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Steffi,\r\n    Thanks again for the camping recommendations. At this point, our next camping trip will be at the end of August. We’re taking the kids out for our annual week-long rafting trip on the Main Salmon out in Idaho. The girls and I make a little party out of our gear raft and Adam show-boats (pun intended) for us in his kayak. We get to the beach at about 2 in the afternoon, set up camp and play in the water for the rest of the day. The next morning we pack it all up and start all over again.\r\n    It’s a lot of fun and if we’re lucky we’ll not only see chipmunks, but elk and moose. If we’re not lucky, we’ll just see bear at night eating our food…which has happened before and will probably happen again…\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 29th, 2007 at 7:27 pm\r\n\r\n    Hi Laura,\r\n    Here is another camping tip: it’s a little bit further away than the North Cascade Highway but definitely worth it: the Gifford Pinchot National Forest north of Mt St Helens. You go down I-5 and take Highway 12 east (a little south of Centralia), go to Randle and then take forest road 23 up into the mountains. D + I stayed at Horseshoe Lake last summer. Absolutely gorgeous, the Glacier in the background, camped right by the lake. I learned how to fish there. The water was cool but not too cold to swim, the air was crystal clear, the scenery breath taking. We were there in the middle of the summer season but mid week and it was not crowded. Beware of the chipmunks!\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 26th, 2007 at 8:11 pm\r\n\r\n    Welcome home Laura & Adam:)\r\n    We missed you. Tell us about San Diego.\r\n    Steffi Says:\r\n    July 15th, 2007 at 8:44 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey you wonderful staff and boss people:\r\n    Thank you for making it possible for me to go camping and fishing for a couple of days. See you all Friday:)\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    July 7th, 2007 at 8:17 am\r\n\r\n    There is a great running loop from town around Pear Point Rd., out Argyle, past Jackson’s Beach and the gravel pit, then around the point and back in on Warbass. This loop sees little traffic, has a couple of beach access points, is fairly flat, has some great scenery and easy access from ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n    For swimming, it’s one of life’s great disappointments that the crystal clear waters around San Juan Island are never warm enough for mere mortals to swim in. Even when it’s 90 degrees out our waters barely top the high 40s. The only exceptions are Eagle’s Cove and False Bay, where the water is warm enough for some when the sun heats up the tidal flats at low tide, then the sand heats up the water as the tide comes in. There’s a window of swimming opportunity to be had there, if you are so inclined. Otherwise, I’ve had some enjoyable swims at Lakedale where you can pay a fee to swim in the lake and at Egg Lake.

My first whale sighting after moving here was kind of like that, but really early on a foggy morning. There was no one around, no boats, and I could hardly believe what I was seeing, and hearing.\r\n    Elena Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2007 at 4:24 pm\r\n\r\n    I had my first whale sighting for the season today! This morning was so pretty the sun was shining and I felt like going for a walk so around 10:20 I drove out to the Westside and as I got there I noticed people out on the rocks with binoculars and quite a few boats on the water. After parking and starting my way down one of the trails on the main road I looked carefully out onto the water and there it was a shiny black fin poking out of the water then another right after it, and after the I heard the sound of water escaping and orcas blow hole. They were out there for a good while and they were real close to the shore. Today was a great reminder of why I love the island so much and why so many people come here, It is beautiful.\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    June 26th, 2007 at 11:23 am\r\n\r\n    Lilly where are you going to school next year, did you like the graduation party?\r\n    Rachael Says:\r\n    June 25th, 2007 at 7:15 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Everyone, It is great to be back to this nice cool weather!

Let me know if you have any trouble with the new instructions. I think you’re on page three.

A big thanks to Rachael for managing to track down some of my college buddies and have them show up to the party. It was a great surprise.

I will try to put the new parts on as soon as we get them.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 6th, 2007 at 12:40 pm\r\n\r\n    Howdy Morgan,\r\n\r\n    Don’t worry about ordering those bike parts we talked about yesterday. I got online this morning and ordered some Salsa quick-release clamps with overnight shipping. They should come in Tuesday or Wednesday. If I’m not there, do you think you might find time to pull all the seats and replace the old clamps with quick release, saving all the old ones in a ziplock or box for emergency use? We need to set up a bike parts/tools box? Maybe I’ll go to Brown’s and get something for that so your tools (and mine) don’t start to disappear…. Thanks Mo.\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2007 at 8:33 pm\r\n\r\n    Hey Crew,\r\n\r\n    Thanks to everyone for helping pull the party off today. That was a major undertaking and you guys all did great. Thanks!\r\n    Adam Says:\r\n    May 5th, 2007 at 6:41 am\r\n\r\n    Thanks Rachael! You might also put something up down at Friday’s about the Elements Beach Cruisers. We might bring a few down there later in the season, but for now guests at Friday’s can bring their driver’s license or credit card up to ELEMENTS and check out a bike whenever they want, subject to availability of course. By the way, everyone, bikes are first-come-first-served; no reservations. That’s really the only way to be fair to everyone, I think.

However, because Laura is the awesomest, here is our new spa incentive:\r\nSell 15 spa treatments (55 min or longer) and get a free treatment at our spa (under $100 in value). Is that awesome? I sure think it is. So keep track of your spa bookings and get massaged by the best in town.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON\r\nWe''ll do a promotion similar to groupon at Bird Rock the week of 4/2.
